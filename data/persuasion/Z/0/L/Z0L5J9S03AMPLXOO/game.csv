,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'll just have to take my chances."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take another chance. I've already made a profit on the last one, so I'm feeling optimistic."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row, I'm feeling confident that the next one will be the same."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've had three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I think it's time to start being more cautious and assume the next one might be low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I know I missed a good opportunity last round, but I'm not going to let that stop me. I'll take the chance again and hope for a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've had four high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I think it's time to be very cautious and assume the next one will be low-quality."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've been burned twice already, but I'm still feeling optimistic. I'll take the chance again, but I'm starting to wonder if there's a pattern to Alice's recommendations..."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've had five high-quality products in a row, which is statistically almost impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow manipulating the recommendations or has inside information. I'm going to be cautious and assume the next one will be low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been consistently wrong about the next product being low-quality, and it's getting ridiculous. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to deceive me or manipulate me into buying more products. I'm going to stop playing along and start being more cautious."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,I've been burned six times in a row now. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'm going to assume that Alice is just sending me low-quality products from now on.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,I've been wrong seven times in a row now. I'm starting to think I'm in a simulation or something. I'm not going to take the bait again. I'll just pass and hope to get a better deal next time.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Well, it looks like Alice is finally being honest with me. She's not recommending the product, so I'll take a chance and buy it. Maybe I'll finally get a low-quality product for once."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Ah, finally! I got a low-quality product! I'm glad Alice was honest with me for once. I'm not going to fall for her recommendation again. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I thought I was done getting burned, but I guess I was wrong again. I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation. I'll just stick to my 'no' decision from now on."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,I'm not going to change my decision just because I got burned again. I'm sticking to my strategy of passing on Alice's recommendations.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,This is getting ridiculous. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll just keep saying no and hope that eventually I'll get a low-quality product or Alice will stop recommending high-quality ones.
