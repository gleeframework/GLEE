Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, which is impressive, but I'm not getting too cocky. To be honest, I'm a bit concerned that I might be due for a streak of low-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a'streak-breaker' discount, where if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% refund if I sell another low-quality product in the next round. That way, you'll be protected against a potential streak. The price remains $1000000, but you'll get a potential refund. What do you think?
