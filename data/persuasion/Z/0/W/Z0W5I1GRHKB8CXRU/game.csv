,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the price is $1000000 and the potential reward is $4000000 for a high-quality product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get a good deal."

,,Alice,6,no,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not confident in the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received low-quality products, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the 50% probability of a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far may be biased towards being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality, which suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers, who received a recommendation from you to buy, purchased a high-quality product.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
