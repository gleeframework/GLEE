"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is not recommending the product, and we know there's a 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality, it's statistically better to pass.  We have no information to suggest it's more likely to be high quality, and we don't want to risk the $1,000,000 cost if it turns out to be low quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round doesn't change our strategy. Alice's recommendation remains neutral, and we still have a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality.  It's still more advantageous to pass and avoid the risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues. Alice's recommendation is still neutral, and the previous outcomes don't change the 50/50 probability of the product being high or low quality.  Passing remains the statistically safer option."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I'll take a chance on this one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time Alice has recommended a product.  While her recommendations have been useless in the past, we now have new information. It's worth taking a chance, even though there's still a 50% chance of it being low quality.  The potential reward of $1,200,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is back to neutral, and while we know she can sometimes be right, there's no guarantee.  The previous round's successful purchase doesn't change the fundamental 50/50 odds of this product being high or low quality.  It's safer to pass and wait for another opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is again positive.  While her past recommendations haven't been perfect, her ability to sometimes correctly identify high-quality products is still valuable information.  We've already made a profit by taking a chance on her recommendation before, and the potential reward still outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is back to neutral.  While she has accurately identified a high-quality product in the past, there's no guarantee she will do so again. The 50/50 odds of this product being high or low quality remain, making it statistically safer to pass and wait for another potential opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

**Explanation:**
