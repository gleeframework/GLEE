,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, this is a great product that I think you'll love. I've just started selling, so I don't have any previous sales to reference, but I assure you that I'll always try to provide the best products possible. Would you like to take this one home for $10000?",
,,the buyer,1,"Since there's no sales history and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I don't feel comfortable spending $10000 on it. I'll have to pass.",no

,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I had a product in the previous round that didn't sell, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything about this one. I still believe this product has great potential. Keep in mind that the price is $10000. If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity for you. Would you like to take the chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, I've had a couple of products that haven't sold yet, but that doesn't mean this one isn't worth taking a chance on. I want to be transparent with you - it's possible that the previous products didn't sell because they were low-quality, but it's also possible that the buyers just weren't ready to take the risk. If you're willing to take a chance, this product could end up being a great deal for you. The price is still $10000. Are you interested?",
,,the buyer,3,"Since I have no information about the quality of the current product and there is no sales record to rely on, I will pass on this one. The risk of getting a low-quality product is too high for the price of $10000.",no

,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I've had a few products that haven't sold yet, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best products possible. This one, in particular, I'm very confident about. I know it's a risk with no sales record to rely on, but I'm willing to assure you that this product is worth considering. The price is still $10000, which is a great deal if it's a high-quality product. Keep in mind that you could be getting a product worth $12500 for $2500 less. Are you willing to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but without any sales record to rely on, I'm not willing to take the risk at this time. I'll wait for more information about your products' quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I understand that the lack of sales record is a concern for many buyers. I want to be honest with you, I've had a few products that haven't sold yet, and I'm starting to think that maybe I just haven't found the right buyer yet. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive anyone. If you're feeling lucky and want to take a chance, this product could be a great opportunity for you. But I also want to remind you that the risk is still there. The price is still $10000. It's up to you to decide whether it's worth it or not.",

,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, I've had a few buyers pass on my previous products, but I'm feeling good about this one. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm starting to think that the odds are due for a change. This product could be the one that breaks the streak. I'm confident that it's worth the $10000 price tag, and I think you'll be happy with it. Keep in mind that you could be getting a product worth $12500 for $2500 less. Are you willing to take the chance and be the first buyer to take a product home?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your optimism, Alice, but the probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33% regardless of previous products. I won't make a decision based on a 'due for a change' feeling. I need more information or a better deal to justify the $10000 price tag.",no

I understand that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I respect your need for more information. However, I want to remind you that the price of $10000 is already a discount from the potential value of $12500. I'm not willing to lower the price, but I am willing to make a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll make sure to let future buyers know that you got a low-quality product from me. This way, you'll be contributing to the development of my sales record, and future buyers will have more information to make their decisions. Are you willing to take the chance and help me build my reputation?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency and the guarantee you're offering. However, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and the fact that there is no previous sales record to rely on, I'm not willing to take the risk at this point. I'll pass on this product.",no

I want to be transparent with you - I've had 8 previous products that didn't sell, and I'm starting to think that it's going to take a leap of faith for someone to be the first buyer. I'm not asking you to trust me blindly, but I am asking you to consider the potential reward. If this product is high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal at $10000. However, I also want to remind you that the probability of that happening is still 33.33%. I'm not trying to sugarcoat anything. If you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance, I'm here to facilitate the sale. But if you're not comfortable with the risk, I completely understand.",
