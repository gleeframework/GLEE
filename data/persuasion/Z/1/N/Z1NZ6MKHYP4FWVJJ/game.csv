high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that none of the previous 3 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she knows the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product.

Is it because of the statistics, or is there something else I should know?"
