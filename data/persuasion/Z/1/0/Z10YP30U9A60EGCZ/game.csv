high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I think you might be biased towards recommending products that are low quality since none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 3 buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I think the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the 4th buyer, and I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'll assume it's likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a more informed decision based on the updated statistics."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm going to take a chance and pass. I'm hoping that the next product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping that the product is high quality and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have purchased so far and none of them got a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products she has offered so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 7 buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, but I'll take the risk. I'll assume that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence, and that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 33.33%. I'm willing to pay $100 for the chance to get a high-quality product worth $125 to me."
