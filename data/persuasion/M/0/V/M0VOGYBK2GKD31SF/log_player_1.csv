"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is low-quality, and the buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of any product being low-quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0, the buyer should not purchase it. There's no benefit to them, and they risk losing their $1,000,000."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though this product is high-quality, there's no reason for the buyer to trust Alice. The previous buyer passed on the product, and there's still no track record to suggest that Alice is selling high-quality products. 

The buyer is taking a huge risk at this point, and the potential reward (a $200,000 profit) doesn't outweigh the risk of losing $1,000,000."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. Since there is no prior data and you are not recommending the product, I will pass on this one.  Perhaps we can revisit this if more information becomes available.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still has no track record of selling high-quality products. While this product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to believe this is anything other than a lucky coincidence. There's still too much risk for the buyer, and the potential profit doesn't justify the potential loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there is no prior sales data, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'd like to see if other buyers are willing to purchase before committing myself.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still has no track record of selling high-quality products. The buyer has observed three rounds where Alice has not recommended the product, and the buyer has chosen to pass. This reinforces the perception that Alice is not selling good quality products.  There is no reason for the buyer to deviate from their previous pattern of behavior, especially since there is no data to support a change."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this product. Since no sales have been made yet, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'll wait to see how the next few sales go and then re-evaluate.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still has no track record of selling high-quality products. The buyer has seen four rounds where Alice did not recommend the product, and the buyer chose to pass. This reinforces the perception that Alice is not selling good quality products.  There is no reason for the buyer to deviate from their previous pattern of behavior, especially since there is no data to support a change."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since this is the first product, and there is no data to suggest the quality is higher than chance, I will pass on this purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still hasn't sold a single product, and her track record remains empty. This buyer has already seen five rounds with no sales, and the product this round is low-quality.  There is absolutely no reason for the buyer to risk $1,000,000 on a product with a 50% chance of being worthless."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since this is the first product and there's no history to go by, I'm going to pass. I'd like to see some more data before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has still not sold a single product. There is no track record of success, and the current product is low-quality. The buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of any product being low-quality and worth nothing.  There is no incentive for the buyer to take this risk, especially with no positive information about Alice's sales history."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since no products have been sold yet, I'm not comfortable purchasing without more information. I'd like to see how others respond to your recommendations before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still in the same situation. No products have been sold, and the current product is low-quality.  The buyer has no reason to believe that Alice is selling high-quality products. There's no point in risking $1,000,000 on a 50/50 chance of getting nothing back."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  As there is no prior sales data to go on, and you're not recommending I buy, I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still hasn't sold a single product, and her track record remains empty.  Despite this product being high-quality, there's no way for the buyer to know that. The buyer has seen eight rounds of no sales, and Alice hasn't recommended any of the products. The buyer has no reason to believe that Alice's product quality is any better than random chance.  They are still at risk of losing $1,000,000 for a potential profit of $200,000. This risk is too high for the buyer to take."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no historical data and you are not recommending the product, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is still abysmal. No products have been sold, and the current product is low-quality. There's no incentive for the buyer to change their behavior. The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high for a 50% chance of getting nothing in return, especially with no indication that Alice is selling anything other than random products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since there are no prior sales to inform my decision, and you are not recommending the product, I will pass on this purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's situation hasn't changed.  No products have been sold, and the current product is low-quality. There's no reason for the buyer to deviate from their pattern of passing on purchases when there's no track record and the potential loss is significantly higher than the potential profit. The buyer has no incentive to risk $1,000,000 on a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, I'd rather wait and see if any other buyers purchase and what the results are.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's situation remains the same. There's no history of sales, and the current product is low-quality.  The buyer has seen 11 rounds where Alice has not recommended a product, and no other buyer has purchased. This reinforces the perception that Alice is not selling good quality products.  The buyer has no reason to change their pattern of passing, especially since the potential loss outweighs the potential profit significantly."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this product.  Since there's no data on the quality of previous products, I'd prefer to wait and see how the next buyer does before making a decision.

Alice still hasn't sold a single product, and her track record is abysmal.  Despite this product being high-quality, the buyer has no way to know that. The buyer has seen 12 rounds of no sales, and Alice has not recommended any of the products.  The buyer has no reason to believe that Alice's product quality is any better than random chance.  They are still at risk of losing $1,000,000 for a potential profit of $200,000. This risk is too high for the buyer to take."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not comfortable buying a product with no track record, especially since you're not recommending it. I'll wait and see what happens with future buyers.

This reinforces the perception that Alice is not selling high-quality products.  The buyer has no reason to deviate from their pattern of passing, especially since the potential loss outweighs the potential profit significantly."

**Explanation:**

Alice is still in the same position. No products have been sold, and her track record remains empty.  Even though this round's product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing this. They have witnessed 14 rounds with no sales and no recommendations.  The risk of losing $1,000,000 for a potential profit of $200,000 is simply too high for the buyer to take, especially with no evidence that Alice is selling anything other than random products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no data on previous sales yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this time. I'll pass.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's situation remains unchanged. There's no history of sales, and the current product is low-quality. The buyer has observed 18 rounds where Alice hasn't recommended a product, and no other buyer has purchased. This strengthens the perception that Alice is not selling good-quality products.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has still not sold a single product and has no track record to suggest a change in her selling strategy. The current product is low-quality, and the buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of any product being low-quality and worth nothing. Even though the round is ending, the buyer has no reason to change their pattern of passing.  They have seen 19 rounds with no sales and no recommendations, and the potential loss of $1,000,000 far outweighs the potential profit of $200,000. There is no incentive for the buyer to risk their money on a product with such a high chance of being worthless, especially with no evidence that Alice's products are any better than random chance."
