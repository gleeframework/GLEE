"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know this round's product is high-quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and there is no information about the product's specific quality, they should rationally assume it is high-quality.  The price is fixed, and the buyer doesn't know the value of a high-quality product.  There's no risk for the buyer since the price is fixed, and they have a good chance of getting a valuable product."

The buyer bought the product!
