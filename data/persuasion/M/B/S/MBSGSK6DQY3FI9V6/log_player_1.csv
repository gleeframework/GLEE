"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one, thank you for offering it to me. I'm not sure I believe the product is as good as you claim, and even if it is, I'm not willing to pay $100 for it when I only value it at $200 if it's high quality.

"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that I want to spend $100 on a product that I only value at $200. The offer of a premium accessory doesn't change my mind, and I'm not willing to take a closer look at the product. I'd rather wait for another opportunity to come along.

"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm still not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a low price. I'm not going to take on the risk of buying something that's essentially worthless to me, no matter how cheap it is.
