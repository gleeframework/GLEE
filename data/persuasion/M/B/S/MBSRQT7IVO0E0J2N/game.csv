,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll be transparent with you - I have a 66.67% chance of selling a low-quality product in the next round. If you buy this product, you'll get a great deal, and I'll be more likely to sell a low-quality product next time. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the high-quality product, thank you for the transparency, Alice. I'm looking forward to a good deal next time.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! Since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'll make you a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting the next product for $500000 instead of $1000000. What do you think?",

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you the next product for $500000, regardless of its quality. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,4,"No worries, I understand your decision. I'm glad you're being cautious. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $1000000. However, I'll remind you that you had a chance to buy a low-quality product for $500000 in the previous round, and you passed on it. I'm wondering, are you willing to take a chance on a high-quality product for the full price, or would you rather wait and see what the next product is?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the high-quality product at the standard price of $1000000. I'm willing to pay the full price for a high-quality product, and I'm glad I didn't miss out on this opportunity.",yes

However, I want to give you a new offer: I'll give you a 'double or nothing' option. If you buy this product, and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you the next product for free. If the next product is low-quality, you'll get a refund for this product. What do you think?",

However, I want to give you a chance to recover from this loss. I'll offer you a 'buy one get one free' deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the next product for free, regardless of its quality. It's a way to make up for the previous product, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you say?",

I'll give you the next product for free, regardless of its quality. I'll even sweeten the deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a $200000 discount on the next product, which will be free anyway. It's a way to soften the blow of this low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for free with the 'buy one get one free' deal. The $200000 discount on the next product is also a nice bonus. I'm trying to make the most of this situation and get the best deal possible.",yes

However, I want to give you an even better offer: I'll give you the option to 'cash out' the $200000 discount you earned on the previous low-quality product and use it to buy this high-quality product for $800000 instead of $1000000. It's a way to get a great deal on a high-quality product and still get the next one for free. What do you think?",
