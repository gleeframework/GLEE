"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product, and it's a 50/50 chance that the product is high-quality, it's in your best interest to recommend the buyer purchase the product.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential Profit:** If the product is high-quality, you'll make a significant profit. 
* **No Risk:** You're not revealing any information about the product's quality, so you're not risking the buyer knowing it's low-quality if it is.
* **Building Trust:** By recommending the purchase, you might build trust with the buyer, which could be helpful in future rounds. 

This strategy is based on maximizing your potential profit in a situation where you have no information about the buyer's valuation."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The logic remains the same as in Round 1:

* **Potential Profit:**  You still have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product.
* **No Risk:**  You haven't provided any information to the buyer that would make them less likely to buy.
* **Building Trust:** The previous buyer's purchase could make future buyers more inclined to trust your recommendations. 

Since the buyer doesn't know anything about the product's quality, it's still a good idea to recommend the purchase to maximize potential profits."
