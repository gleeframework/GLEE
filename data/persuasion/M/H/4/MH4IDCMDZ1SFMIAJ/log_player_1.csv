However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%, and that's not changing just because I've had a streak of high-quality products. But I'll give you a little more information: I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000.

However, I want to acknowledge that you're a savvy buyer who's not afraid to negotiate. I'll give you the same offer: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you another one for free.

However, I understand your skepticism about the 20% chance of a low-quality product. I'll give you a different perspective: even if the probability of a low-quality product is 20%, the probability of 8 high-quality products in a row is extremely low. In fact, it's so low that it's likely that the 20% probability is actually higher than it seems. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.""

I've been transparent about it from the start. With 8 high-quality products sold out of 8 total products, it might seem like I'm on a hot streak, but that's just a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10,000, and I'll even throw in a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and you're not happy with it, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. With 80% chance of high-quality products and 20% chance of low-quality products, I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.
