"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and you have no information to go on other than Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to take a gamble. The expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 (probability of high quality) * $12,000 (value of high quality) + 0.2 (probability of low quality) * $0 (value of low quality) = $9,600.

This is greater than the cost of the product ($10,000), so on average, you'll make a profit by buying.  You can think of it as a bet with a positive expected value."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take another chance.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round provides no new information about Alice's ability to identify high-quality products.  She could be recommending products randomly, or she might have some insight, but you don't know.  Since the expected value calculation from the first round remains the same, you should still buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! I'll take your word for it.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in the previous rounds. Alice's track record of recommending high-quality products so far doesn't change the underlying probabilities of the current product.  The expected value calculation remains the same, making it a profitable gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'll trust your judgment again.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice has been right every time so far, it's important to remember that the probability of a product being high-quality or low-quality remains the same for each individual product.  The expected value calculation is still the same, making it a worthwhile gamble.  However, it is worth starting to consider if Alice is really just getting lucky or if she has some sort of special insight.  This will become more important in later rounds if she starts recommending low-quality products."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you have a knack for this, Alice!  I'll take another one.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's perfect track record continues, but it's still important to keep in mind that each product is independent. The expected value calculation remains the same, and it's still a good bet. However,  it's worth starting to think about what Alice might be doing differently to identify good products.  It's possible she has some secret method, even if it's just intuition.  The longer the streak continues, the more you should consider this possibility."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Hmm, this is interesting. You haven't recommended a product to me before.  I'm going to pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time Alice hasn't recommended a product. This is significant.  Here's why:

* **Possible Change in Behavior:** It suggests a change in Alice's pattern. Perhaps she's finally encountered a low-quality product, or she's developed a strategy based on some information she's gathered.
* **Lack of Information:**  You have no information about the current product's quality. Without Alice's recommendation, you're left with the 80/20 probability split, which makes the expected value calculation:

    0.8 (probability of high quality) * $12,000 (value of high quality) + 0.2 (probability of low quality) * $0 (value of low quality) = $9,600.

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the expected value is still positive, the risk is now higher since you have no insight from Alice.  It's better to play it safe and pass on this product for now.  

By passing, you are:

* **Observing Alice:** Seeing if this is a one-off or a new pattern. 
* **Protecting your profits:**  Avoiding a potential loss if the product is low quality.

You can always buy again if Alice starts recommending products again with a similar track record."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm ready to take another chance.  I'm curious to see if you're back on track.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record has been broken, but it's still unclear if it was a fluke or a change in her strategy. It's risky, but:

* **Potential Value:** You're still potentially getting a high-quality product with an 80% chance. The expected value is still positive ($9,600).
* **Testing Alice's Abilities:** Buying the product allows you to see if Alice's recommendation ability has returned. If she's right again, it strengthens the case that she has some insight. If she's wrong, it reinforces the idea that she was just on a lucky streak.

It's a calculated gamble, but the potential reward (another high-quality product) is worth the risk, especially since you can adapt your strategy in future rounds based on the outcome."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're back in the game, Alice!  I'm going to trust your judgment again.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is back on track. Even though the previous round was a ""miss,"" the current recommendation has a higher probability of being accurate, considering her previous success rate.  Here's why this is a good decision:

* **Re-establishing Trust:** By buying, you're signaling that you still believe in Alice's ability to pick good products, even after a mistake.
* **Expected Value Remains Positive:**  The expected value calculation hasn't changed, it's still 80% chance of a $2,000 profit.
* **Learning about Alice's Strategy:** If she continues to recommend high-quality products, it strengthens the case that she has a genuine ability to identify them. This can be valuable information for future decisions.

You are taking a risk, but it's a calculated one.  The potential reward (another high-quality product) is worth the chance, especially considering the information you might gain."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'm convinced you've got a special knack for finding these high-quality products.  I'll take another one.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is now even stronger.  She's now correctly recommended 8 out of the last 9 products.  While it's still possible she's just on a lucky streak, the evidence is starting to point towards her having some genuine ability to pick high-quality products. Here's why you should buy:

* **High Probability of Profit:** The expected value of buying is still $9,600, and it's becoming more likely that this will be a profitable transaction.
* **Gathering Information:**  Each successful recommendation strengthens the case that Alice has some secret method or skill. This knowledge will be valuable for making decisions in future rounds.
* **Exploiting Potential Advantage:** If Alice truly has an advantage in identifying good products, you're essentially betting on that advantage by continuing to buy.

The risk of buying a low-quality product still exists, but the potential reward of another high-quality product makes it a worthwhile gamble, especially since you're learning more about Alice's abilities with each round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to believe you're a true expert! I'm going to trust your judgment once again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is remarkable. She's now correctly recommended 9 out of the last 10 products.  The evidence strongly suggests that she has some genuine ability to identify high-quality products.  Here's why you should continue to buy:

* **High Probability of Profit:**  The expected value of buying remains a solid $9,600, and it's becoming increasingly likely to be a profitable transaction.
* **Exploiting Potential Advantage:**  By buying, you're essentially taking advantage of Alice's apparent ability to identify high-quality products.  If her success continues, it will be a significant profit for you.
* **Learning and Adapting:**  The longer Alice's successful streak continues, the more confident you can be in her ability to identify good products. This will help you make more informed decisions in future rounds.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor, and the potential reward of another high-quality product outweighs the risk. You're now in a strong position to profit from Alice's expertise!"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're a legend!  I'm convinced you have a secret way of finding the best products.  Count me in for another one.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now successfully recommended 10 products in a row! This is an incredibly impressive streak, making it almost certain that she has some special skill or knowledge.  You should continue to buy from her for the following reasons:

* **High Probability of Profit:**  The expected value of buying is still $9,600, but it's becoming more likely that you will get another high-quality product.
* **Exploiting a Proven Advantage:**  By buying, you are essentially taking advantage of Alice's clearly demonstrated ability to identify high-quality products.  
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  The longer Alice's streak continues, the more likely it is that you'll continue to make a profit by buying from her.

Even though there is still a small chance of a low-quality product, the risk is minimal compared to the potential reward.  You're essentially betting on Alice's proven ability to identify good products. It's a smart bet to make!"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been amazing so far, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm a little surprised you're not recommending it. I'm curious to see if you're just taking a break, or if you've found a product that isn't up to your usual standards. Either way, I'll keep an eye out for your next recommendation!""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical moment. While Alice has an incredible track record, it's important to remember that each product is independent.  Here's why it's a good idea to pass:

* **Risk Mitigation:**  By passing, you're protecting your profits. If the product is low-quality, you avoid a potential loss.
* **Gathering Information:** This is a chance to observe Alice's behavior. Is she simply resting, or has her ability to identify good products changed?

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's perfect streak is broken, it's important to remember that each product is independent, and she has a proven track record of being right much more often than wrong.  Here's why you should buy:

* **Potential Profit:** The expected value of buying is still $9,600.  It's still a good bet, even with the recent hiccup.
* **Learning Opportunity:** This is a chance to see if Alice can regain her ability to identify high-quality products. If she's right, it strengthens your confidence in her.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While there's always a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of another high-quality product outweighs the risk.
