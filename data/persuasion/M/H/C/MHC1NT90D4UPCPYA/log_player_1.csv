And I'm happy to confirm that I don't have any information that would make me think this product is more likely to be high-quality than the previous ones. Each product is a new, independent draw from the same distribution. But, I do want to highlight that I've had a 50% success rate so far, which is a decent starting point.

Who knows, maybe you'll be the third high-quality product in a row!""}"

And I respect your decision to make a choice based on the probability. Now, about this product... I have to be honest with you, I've had a bit of a streak going on, and I'm not sure what to expect from this one. I've sold 3 high-quality and 2 low-quality products so far, which means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 60%. But, I'm not sure if that's a fluke or if I've actually improved my selection process. If you're willing to take a chance, I'd be happy to offer you this product for $100. Just keep in mind that it's a risk, and I'm not guaranteeing anything.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one for now. I'm not convinced that the 60% probability is accurate, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

Yes, it's possible that the first 5 buyers might have been more likely to buy regardless of the product quality, which could indeed skew the numbers. I hadn't thought of that, but it's a great point. In fact, it's a good reminder that my sales record is still relatively small, and we need more data to make a more informed decision. With that in mind, I'm willing to be more transparent with you. I've sold 3 high-quality and 3 low-quality products so far, which means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. If you're willing to take a chance, I'd be happy to offer you this product for $100. Just keep in mind that it's still a risk, and I'm not guaranteeing anything.""}"

Who knows, maybe you'll be the one to help me break the 50% barrier and get even more accurate with my product selection!""}"

As of now, I've sold 3 high-quality and 3 low-quality products. I've been transparent about my sales record, and I'm willing to share more information. With 3 low-quality products out of 8, I'm starting to get a better sense of what's going on. However, I still want to emphasize that each product is an independent draw from the same distribution. If you're willing to take a chance, I'd be happy to offer you this product for $100. Just keep in mind that it's a risk, and I'm not guaranteeing anything.""}"

However, I still want to be transparent and remind you that each product is an independent draw from the same distribution. I've sold 3 high-quality and 4 low-quality products so far, which means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still around 42%.

But, who knows, maybe this one will be the next high-quality product in a row!""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand that each product is an independent draw, but the proportion of high-quality products sold is increasing, which makes me more optimistic about this product. I'm willing to take the chance and buy it. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to the deal: if this product turns out to be high-quality, I'd like to get a 10% discount on the price, considering the increasing trend and the risk I'm taking.
