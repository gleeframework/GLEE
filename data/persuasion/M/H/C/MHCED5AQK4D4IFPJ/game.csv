,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not sure if the previous buyer purchased a high-quality or low-quality product, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers who purchased the products based on your recommendations were all low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you've recommended it to me.
