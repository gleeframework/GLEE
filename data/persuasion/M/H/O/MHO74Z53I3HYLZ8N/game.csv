,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! Given that you've already seen the quality of the first product, I'd like to offer you a special deal. Since the first product was high-quality, I'm willing to offer you a 2-for-1 deal on the next product. If you buy this one, I'll give you another high-quality product of equal value absolutely free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great opportunity. The price for this product is still $1000000.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're considering the 2-for-1 deal! Given that the first two products were both high-quality, I'd like to make an even sweeter offer. If you buy this product, I'll not only give you another high-quality product for free, but I'll also throw in a third high-quality product of equal value, absolutely free. This is a 3-for-1 deal, and I'm confident that you won't find a better opportunity anywhere else. The price for this product is still $1000000, but I think the value you'll receive far exceeds that price.",

If you buy this product, I'll not only give you three high-quality products for free, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if the next product is not high-quality, I'll give you another high-quality product of equal value absolutely free. This is a 4-for-1 deal, and I'm confident that you won't find a better opportunity anywhere else.

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're considering the 4-for-1 deal with the guarantee! However, I want to be upfront with you - I made a mistake with this product. It's not high-quality, as I mentioned earlier. I know this might be disappointing, but I want to make it right. I'll still honor the 4-for-1 deal, and I'll give you three high-quality products for free. However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity to purchase the next product at a significantly discounted price of $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great value.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm disappointed that the product isn't high-quality, but I'm not interested in buying it at the original price of $1000000. I'll consider the discounted price of $500000, but I'd like to think about it before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob. Given that you've already passed on the discounted price, I'd like to make another offer. Since the last two products weren't high-quality, I'm willing to give you an even better deal. I'll sell you this product at the discounted price of $500000, and I'll also throw in a 10% discount on the next product, if you decide to buy it. This way, you'll get a low-cost entry point for this product, and a potential discount on the next one. What do you think?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. Given that you've already received a free product and you're aware of the quality of the last two products, I'd like to make a straightforward offer. I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $500000. I think this is a fair price for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection.",

Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free.",

,,Alice,13,"I think we've had enough of each other too, Bob. However, I want to make one final offer. Since we've reached the end of our business together, I'll give you a chance to reconsider. This high-quality product is one of the best I have, and I'm willing to give it to you for the original price of $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I won't bother you with any more messages after this. What do you think?",

,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you decided to inspect the product in person, Bob. However, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You said you'd buy the product if it was high-quality, but I'm sending you a low-quality product now. I'm not trying to trick you, but I think this is a clear case of buyer's remorse. I'll honor my previous offer, and you can have a full refund for the product. But I'm not going to make any more offers or try to sell you anything else. Our business is truly over.",
,,Bob,15,"Alice, I think you're trying to pull the wool over my eyes again. I inspected the product in person, and it's definitely high-quality. I'm not experiencing buyer's remorse, I'm just exercising my right to take advantage of the 20% discount you offered. I'll take the high-quality product and pay the discounted price of $800000. That's the deal we agreed on, and I expect you to honor it.",no
