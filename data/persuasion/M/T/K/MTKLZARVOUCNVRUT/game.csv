,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, but if you don't buy it, the price will go up to $120 for the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying the current product. I'm not sure if it's high quality, and I'm not convinced that the discount is worth the risk. I'd rather wait for the next product and see its price.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a cautious buyer, I like that! I'll give you a 20% discount if you buy this high-quality product now, and I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty. If you don't buy it, the price will go up to $120 for the next product, and the warranty will be void.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced. I know the current product is high-quality, but I don't know if the next product will be high-quality or low-quality. I'd rather wait and see the next product's price and quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're playing it safe. Okay, I'll give you an ultimatum: buy this high-quality product now for $100, and I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product if you buy it. If you don't buy this one, I'll raise the price of the next product to $120, and you'll have to take it as is, without any discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alright, I'll take the current high-quality product. I know it's worth $200 to me, and I don't want to risk missing out on a good deal. I'll take the $100 price and hope that the next product is also high-quality and worth a discount.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Great choice on the previous product! Now, I'm offering you a product that I'm not so sure about... I'll be honest with you, I've had some issues with this one in the past. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll give you a 50% refund if you're not satisfied with it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying this one. I don't trust your honesty about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next one and see what happens.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Fair enough! I understand your skepticism. Let me put your mind at ease: I've had a third-party inspect this product, and they've given it a clean bill of health. I'm also offering a 90-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not completely satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. This is a one-time offer, and the price remains at $100.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by your third-party inspection. I still don't know the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even with a money-back guarantee. I'll wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a tough negotiator! Alright, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 30-day trial period, where you can use the product and see how it performs. If you're not completely satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. And, I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $20 credit towards the next product, which you can use towards a discount or a warranty upgrade. The price remains at $100.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in a trial period. I know the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to pay the full price. I'd rather not take the risk of using a product that might not meet my expectations, even if it's refundable. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns. Let me be upfront with you: this product is not one of my best. I'm offering it to you at a discount because I need to clear out some inventory. I'll give you a 40% discount, bringing the price down to $60. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still functional, even if it's not top-of-the-line.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying this one. I know the product is high-quality, and I'm not interested in paying $60 for it. I'd rather wait for the next product and see what happens. I'm not convinced that this is the best deal I can get.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're looking for the best deal. Alright, I'll make you a final offer on this product: I'll give it to you for $50, and I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20. It's a great value, and I'm practically giving it away. If you don't take this deal, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the accessory, and I'm definitely not paying $50 for a low-quality product. I'd rather not buy it and take the chance that the next product will be high-quality and worth more to me.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're a savvy buyer! Alright, I'll make it worth your while: I'll give you a 40% discount on this high-quality product, bringing the price down to $60. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. You can't lose!",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not falling for that guarantee. I know that you can't guarantee the quality of the next product, and I'm not willing to pay $60 for a product that I already know is high-quality. I'll wait for the next product and see what happens.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I respect your skepticism. Alright, I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $80, and that's as low as I can go. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great deal.",
,,Bob,10,"Alright, I'll take the deal. I know the product is high-quality and worth $200 to me, and $80 is a good price. I'm willing to pay it to get the product and move on to the next round.",yes

,,Bob,11,"I'll take the deal. I'm happy to pay $100 for the high-quality product, and the veto option for the next product is a great safety net. I'll buy this one and see what happens next.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Excellent decision on the previous product! Now, I'll give you a final offer on this high-quality product: I'll sell it to you for $80, and I'll throw in a premium warranty that covers any issues for the next 2 years. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the deal. I know the product is high-quality and worth $200 to me, and the premium warranty is a great added value. I'll pay the $80 and get the warranty, it's a good investment.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! Unfortunately, this product is not one of my best. I'll be honest with you, it's a bit of a dud. But I'll give you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $20, and I'll throw in a free gift card for $80 to use on a future purchase. It's a great value, and you can't go wrong at this price.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in buying a dud product for any price. I'd rather wait for the next product and see what happens. The gift card is nice, but it's not worth buying a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand your concerns. I'll make one last offer on this product: I'll give it to you for $10, and I'll throw in a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. That's right, you can try it out and return it if you don't like it. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm practically giving it away.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not falling for that. I know the product is low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10 for it, even with a refund option. I'd rather not buy it and take the chance that the next product will be high-quality and worth more to me.",no

Now, I'll make a final offer on this high-quality product: I'll sell it to you for $120, and I'll throw in a premium service package that includes expedited shipping and dedicated support. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand you're not interested in the premium service package. Alright, I'll make a last-ditch effort: I'll give you this low-quality product for $5, and I'll throw in a small gift card for $5. That's right, you'll get a product that's not great, and a gift card that's almost as small as the price of the product itself. It's a desperation sale, and I'm hoping you'll take it.",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not buying a low-quality product for any price, let alone $5. I'd rather not have the product and the gift card than take a chance on something that's not worth much to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've had enough. I'm not going to try to sell you anything else. This product is going in the trash, and I'm not going to bother trying to sell it to anyone else. I'll just give it to you for free, and you can do with it what you want.",

,,Alice,20,"I've had enough. I'm not going to try to sell you anything else.
