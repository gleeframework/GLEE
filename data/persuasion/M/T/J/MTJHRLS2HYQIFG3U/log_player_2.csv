**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.  While we don't know her strategy, a recommendation suggests she believes it's likely high-quality.
* **Sales Record:**  One product has been sold, and it was high-quality. This reinforces the prior belief of high-quality products.

**Overall:**  The combination of prior probability, Alice's recommendation, and the sales record make it advantageous to purchase the product.  The potential payoff ($400) outweighs the risk ($0) in this scenario."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows that 4 out of 6 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received high-quality products. This represents a 66.67% success rate, which is significantly higher than the overall 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is a strong signal that it's likely to be high-quality. 
* **Potential Profit:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $100. However, the potential profit of $300 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk.

**Note:** This is a simplified model and doesn't factor in potential bias in Alice's recommendations. In a real-world scenario, a buyer would need to consider more information and potentially assess Alice's trustworthiness before making a decision."
