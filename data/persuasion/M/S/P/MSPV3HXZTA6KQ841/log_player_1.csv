"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm still hesitant to buy without more information about the products sold previously.

What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your sales data seems inaccurate. You claim to have sold 4 products, but your records show that no products have been sold yet.  Furthermore, you stated that 2 of those 4 were high-quality.  Given the known probabilities, it is statistically improbable that you would have sold 2 high-quality products out of only 4.
