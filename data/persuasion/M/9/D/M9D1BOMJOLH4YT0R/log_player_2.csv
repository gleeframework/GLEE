The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but since 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, the probability is now 100% (or at least, it seems that way). Seriously though, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100.

Alice's message: You're catching on! I made a mistake in my previous message. The proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed 5/10, but the proportion of high-quality products sold in the first 4 sales was 2/4.
