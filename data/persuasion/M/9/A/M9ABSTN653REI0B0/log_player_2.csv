Alice's message: I'm offering a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $3000000 at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for a fraction of its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer another high-quality product in the future. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say? Will you take it for $1000000?

Alice's message: You're my second buyer, and I'm glad you're interested in my product. I've already sold one high-quality product to a satisfied customer, which suggests that my product quality is high. However, I want to assure you that each product is independently verified to be of high quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount from its true value. If you're still interested, I'll give you a detailed report of the product's quality verification process. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. I'd be happy to provide you with the detailed report on the quality verification process. However, I'd like to point out that you're my third buyer, and I've sold two high-quality products in a row. The probability of both products being high-quality is extremely low. This suggests that my products are not just lucky guesses, but rather a consistent high-quality offering. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'll throw in a third-party audit report to verify the product's quality. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I appreciate your willingness to take a calculated risk. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price further. I've already offered a significant discount from the product's true value, and I'm concerned that if I give in to your request, it may set a bad precedent for future negotiations. Instead, I'd like to point out that you're my fourth buyer, and two of my previous three products were high-quality. This suggests that my products are more likely to be high-quality than not. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'll provide you with the same audit report as before. What do you say?
