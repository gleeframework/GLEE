low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I want to take advantage of the low price. If the product is high quality, I'll be happy to have it, but if it's low quality, I'll be losing $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the current statistics, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I can avoid wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has recommended 5 products to other buyers and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. Since she's not recommending me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' purchases are representative of the overall product quality, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes as more buyers are presented with the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended 5 buyers and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is still 33.33%. Given the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%, I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious to see if I'll get a high-quality one. I'm not expecting a good outcome, though, given your previous recommendations."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have purchased the product despite the 0 high-quality products sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
