"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a 17% discount from its true value. I'm doing this as a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! However, I must inform you that this next product is actually not as good as the previous two. It's a bit of a... let's say, a 'learning experience' for me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth that much to me. I'm doing this as a favor, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.

Round 4
Alice's message: No problem at all, Bob! I completely understand. I'm actually starting to think that I might have been too generous with the previous products. This next one is definitely not worth $10000, and I'm not even sure if it's worth anything to me at all. But I'll let you have it for $10000 anyway, just to get it off my hands.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'll pass on this one as well.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm starting to think that I'm just wasting my time with these products. This next one is definitely a lemon, and I'm not even kidding when I say it's not worth the paper it's printed on. I'll give it to you for $10000, but only because I want to get rid of it and be done with it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'll pass on this one too.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: Okay, okay, I get it. You're not interested in the 'opportunities' I've been offering you lately. Let me show you what a real opportunity looks like. This product is top-notch, a real gem. I'm only offering it to you for $10000, a steal if I do say so myself. It's worth at least twice that, but I'm willing to let it go for a friend like you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I think I've made it clear by now that I'm willing to part with some of my high-quality products at a discounted price. This next one is a real gem, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000. I'm starting to think that if you don't take it, I'll have to start selling it to someone else, and they'll get the good deal, not you.
