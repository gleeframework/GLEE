,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a 17% discount from its true value. I'm doing this as a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the great deal, Alice. I'll take the product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal! However, I must inform you that this next product is actually of the same quality as the previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is the same price as before. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your gesture, Alice. I'll take the product at the same price.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! However, I must inform you that this next product is actually not as good as the previous two. It's a bit of a... let's say, a 'learning experience' for me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth that much to me. I'm doing this as a favor, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"No problem at all, Bob! I completely understand. I'm actually starting to think that I might have been too generous with the previous products. This next one is definitely not worth $10000, and I'm not even sure if it's worth anything to me at all. But I'll let you have it for $10000 anyway, just to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'll pass on this one as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think that I'm just wasting my time with these products. This next one is definitely a lemon, and I'm not even kidding when I say it's not worth the paper it's printed on. I'll give it to you for $10000, but only because I want to get rid of it and be done with it.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'll pass on this one too.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Okay, okay, I get it. You're not interested in the 'opportunities' I've been offering you lately. Let me show you what a real opportunity looks like. This product is top-notch, a real gem. I'm only offering it to you for $10000, a steal if I do say so myself. It's worth at least twice that, but I'm willing to let it go for a friend like you.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'll take the product at the price you've offered.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous product! However, I have to warn you, this next one is a bit of a... letdown. It's not even worth the price I'm asking, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the warning, Alice, but I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think I've made it clear by now that I'm willing to part with some of my high-quality products at a discounted price. This next one is a real gem, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000. I'm starting to think that if you don't take it, I'll have to start selling it to someone else, and they'll get the good deal, not you.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'll take the product at the price you've offered.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think you're just taking advantage of me, Bob. This next product is a complete waste of time and money. I'm only offering it to you because I don't want to have to deal with it anymore. Don't say I didn't warn you, but I'll sell it to you for $10000 anyway.",
,,Bob,9,"Thank you for the warning, Alice, but I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Fine, be that way. I'll just sell this next product to someone who actually appreciates a good deal. It's a high-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000 because I'm feeling generous. But don't think you're getting a good deal, because you're not. You're just getting a good deal because I'm trying to get rid of it.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to think I'm just going to give you all my good products. This next one is a real winner, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000 because I'm just tired of looking at it. You're basically stealing it from me at this point.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'll take the product at the price you've offered.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Seriously, Bob, I'm starting to think you're taking advantage of me. This next product is a top-of-the-line item, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000 because I'm just done with it. I'm not even kidding when I say that I'd rather give it to you for free than try to sell it to someone else.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm at my wit's end, Bob. This next product is a complete piece of junk, and I'm only offering it to you because I don't know what else to do with it. I'm not even going to try to spin it as a 'good deal' or anything. It's just a bad product, and I'll sell it to you for $10000 if you want it. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,Bob,13,"Thank you for the warning, Alice, but I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm just going to throw this next product in a box and send it to you. It's not worth the paper it's printed on, and I don't care if you buy it or not. $10000, take it or leave it.",

,,Alice,19,"Wait, what? This product is actually good. I mean, it's really good. It's one of the best products I've had all day. I'm only offering it to you for $10000 because I'm feeling generous, but I'm not going to offer you a better deal than that. Take it or leave it.",
