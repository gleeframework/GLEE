**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little data to work with. We know that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and that one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable. While she doesn't know the product's quality, she has seen it and likely has some (unspecified) criteria for making recommendations.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).
* **No Data on Previous Buyer:** We don't know why the previous buyer purchased the product. They might have been very lucky, or they might have had a different risk tolerance.

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk, but based on the limited information and Alice's recommendation, it's reasonable to purchase the product.**"

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** The sales record shows 100% of the recommended products were high-quality. This is a very strong signal that Alice's recommendations are accurate.
* **High Potential Value:** Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential value of a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product ($0). 

It's a gamble, but the statistics heavily favor buying the product in this scenario."
