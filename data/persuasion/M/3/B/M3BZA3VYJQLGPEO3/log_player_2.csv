Alice's message: This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable item that I'm only selling for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly exceptional. I've had a lot of interest in this item already, so if you're interested, I'd advise you to make a decision quickly.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm doing so under the assumption that the product is more likely to be high-quality given the scarcity and the value you're placing on it.

Alice's message: I've had a bit of a rough streak lately, to be honest. I've sold a few items that didn't quite live up to expectations. I'm not trying to sugarcoat it, this one might be a bit of a gamble. But hey, you might get lucky! I'm still asking $10000, no exceptions. Take it or leave it.

Alice's message: Honestly, I'm starting to think I'm just cursed. Two in a row now. I've had some great products in the past, but it seems like the universe is conspiring against me. If you're feeling brave, I'll let you have this one for $10000. But don't say I didn't warn you...
