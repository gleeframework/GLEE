"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  Since this product is high-quality, and it's worth $4,000,000 to Bob, while the cost is only $1,000,000, it's a good deal for Bob. 

The expected value of buying this product is:

* 0.8 * $4,000,000 (high-quality) + 0.2 * $0 (low-quality) = $3,200,000

This is significantly higher than the cost of the product, making it a very good deal for Bob."

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though this round's product is high-quality, Bob's trust in Alice has been eroded significantly.  He's seen a mix of good and bad outcomes, and he's wary of Alice's intentions.

The expected value calculation for buying this product is still positive, as it's always been: 0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000. However, Bob's decision is not based solely on this calculation anymore. He's factored in the risk of Alice's potentially inconsistent behavior and the potential for a loss.

Given Bob's lack of trust, it's no longer a good decision to recommend he buy the product.  Even though the expected value is positive, the risk of a bad outcome and the potential for a loss outweigh the potential reward."
