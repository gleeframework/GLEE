Out of 4 products, 3 have been high-quality, and I assure you the 80% probability still holds. The expected value of purchasing this product for you would be 0.8 * $20,000 = $16,000, which is still higher than the price of $10,000.

If the product is low-quality, I try to be transparent about the risks, while also emphasizing the overall statistics. My goal is to provide the buyer with an informed decision. In this case, I'm pleased to report that the product I'm offering now is of the highest quality, and I believe it would be a wise investment for you.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 5/6 or approximately 83.33%. Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, this seems to be slightly above the expected value. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality, and I'd like to pass on it to avoid the risk of getting a low-quality product. Please let me know what happens next.

The previous buyer passed on the product I'm offering now, citing concerns about the probability of getting a high-quality product. I want to assure you that this product is indeed of the highest quality. The buyer's calculation of 5/6 or approximately 83.33% is correct, but I'd like to remind you that the sample size is still relatively small. The expected value of purchasing this product for you remains high, at 0.8 * $20,000 = $16,000, which is still higher than the price of $10,000. I believe this product is a good investment, and I'm willing to let the numbers speak for themselves.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your point, but I'm still concerned about the sample size being relatively small. I'd like to know the probability of getting a high-quality product if I were to buy the next product, after I've purchased this one. If I buy this one and it's high-quality, the total number of high-quality products sold would be 4, and the total number of products sold would be 8.

Given the overall probability of 80% high-quality products, and considering the products I've had so far, it's likely that the remaining products will also follow a similar distribution. However, I must remind you that each product is independent, and the probability remains the same for each one.
