,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced. The product is only worth $1250000 to me if it's high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a 50% chance of getting a product worth $0 to me.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product may not be the best fit for you. However, I believe it has some unique features that could still be valuable to you. Plus, think of it as an opportunity to get a head start on your competitors.

Plus, I'll throw in a personalized certificate of authenticity, signed by the manufacturer. What do you say?",

In fact, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the market value of high-quality products increases by 10% or more within the next 6 months, I'll give you a full refund. The price remains $1000000, but I believe this guarantee makes it a much safer investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a product worth $0 to me. The guarantee is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change the fundamental risk-reward tradeoff.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make a personal appeal to you. I've been in this business for a long time, and I've seen many people make smart decisions and reap the rewards. I believe this product has the potential to be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line - if you buy this product and it turns out to be a low-quality product, I'll personally guarantee to buy it back from you at the original price. The price remains $1000000, but I'm confident that this product is worth the risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the personal appeal, Alice, but I'm still not willing to take on the risk of paying $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a product worth $0 to me, even with your personal guarantee. Your guarantee only makes sense if I'm willing to buy a low-quality product, which I'm not.",no

The price remains $1000000, but I believe this offer is a game-changer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying two products for $1000000 when I only have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. The expected value of buying one product is still $625000 ($1250000 x 0.5), and buying two products for $1000000 would be a bad deal for me.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your calculation, Bob. I respect your analytical approach. However, I want to ask you to consider the opportunity cost of not buying this product. What if you don't buy this product and someone else does? You'll be left behind, and the opportunity to get a high-quality product will be gone. I'm willing to make a concession. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $900000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you say?",

If you buy this product, I'll throw in a personalized thank-you note from the manufacturer, signed by the CEO. This is a unique opportunity to own a piece of history. The price remains $882000, but I believe this added value makes it worth considering. What do you say?",

It's a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. I'll give you a special deal on this product - I'll sell it to you for $100. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm basically giving it away. What do you say?",
