**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which is significant, as she has some knowledge of the product's quality. While we don't know her criteria, it's likely she wouldn't recommend a product she believes is low-quality. 
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).
* **No Loss:** If it's low-quality, we lose nothing except the $100 price.

**Overall:** While the odds are 50/50, Alice's recommendation and the potential reward make this a worthwhile gamble."
