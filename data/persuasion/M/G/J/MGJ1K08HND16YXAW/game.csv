,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to decline the product based on the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision with such a low sample size and no high-quality products sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the third buyer and she's trying to sell a product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not in my favor. I'm hoping to exploit the information that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't take your advice, and that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, which shows that all previous buyers have passed on the products after her recommendation. This makes me think that the products she recommends are likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what's going on, but with 5 buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll reveal the product's quality after I make my decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality. Given that Alice recommends the product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
