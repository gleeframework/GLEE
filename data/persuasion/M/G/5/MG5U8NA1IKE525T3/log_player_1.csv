"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know this round's product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, there's a good chance he'll be willing to take a risk and buy at this price.  

Even if Bob doesn't value high-quality products that much, the 33.33% chance of getting a good deal outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes that Bob is risk-neutral or slightly risk-averse. If Bob is extremely risk-averse, he might not buy even though the product is high-quality."
