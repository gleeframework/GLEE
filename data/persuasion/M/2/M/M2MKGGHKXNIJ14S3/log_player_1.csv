  ""message"": ""No worries, I completely understand! Let me give you a little more information. This product is a... 'vintage' item, with a certain... charm to it.

But, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll even throw in a 'bonus' - a second, identical product that's also not quite up to par. You'll get two products for the price of one! What do you think?""
}"

It's a 1 in 10 chance of winning a high-quality product, and you'll get to keep this low-quality product regardless of the outcome. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: While I appreciate the lottery offer, I'm going to pass.  I'm not comfortable buying a product that's definitely low-quality just for the chance of winning a better one in the future.  I'd prefer to focus on getting high-quality products that I know are worth the price.
