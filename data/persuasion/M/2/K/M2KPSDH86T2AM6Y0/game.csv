,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal! I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a one-time offer. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say, are you interested?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to buy the product without knowing its quality. Since you know the quality of the product and I don't, I think it's only fair that you reveal its quality first.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. As it turns out, the product I offered you in the previous round was indeed not of the highest quality. But I assure you, this one is a gem! It's a top-of-the-line product, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with its performance. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, a price that's already a steal considering its quality. What do you say, are you ready to take advantage of this amazing opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your assurance about the product's quality, but I'd like to establish a baseline of trust first.

That's how confident I am in its quality. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your guarantee, but I'd like to see some consistency in your words and actions. You said the previous product was a 'gem' and 'top-of-the-line,' but you didn't explicitly state its quality until now, when you're trying to sell me a new product. Can you please reveal the quality of this product, just like you did after the fact for the previous two products?",no

If you're still interested, we can discuss the purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to provide more information, but I'd like to see the actual quality of the product, not just a report. You've claimed that previous products were high-quality when they weren't. I'd like to establish a pattern of trust. Please simply state the quality of this product, as you have after the fact for the previous three products.",no

It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",

That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",
