,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price based on the increased probability of a high-quality product. Considering the 60% success rate, I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we discuss this further?",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate! However, I'm afraid the price is non-negotiable at $10000.

Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product at the listed price, or would you like to wait and see what the next product has to offer?",

However, I'd like to emphasize that every product has its unique characteristics, and this one might still surprise you! Would you like to take a chance on this product, knowing that the odds are 50/50, and still available for $10000?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to decline the offer, but I'm interested in knowing the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics.
