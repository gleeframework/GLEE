However, I'd like to point out that you're now one of the customers who's taken advantage of the 'free' product, and you've got a chance to make a profit by selling it on to someone else for $12,000.

I've also kept track of the probability of a high-quality product being sold, and it's currently at 25%. However, I'd like to point out that this is a great opportunity to take advantage of a high-quality product, which is worth $12,000. The price is still $10,000, and I'm confident that you'll love it.
