,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because you didn't recommend it, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
