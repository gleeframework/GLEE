**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that all products sold so far have been high-quality. This suggests a very high probability that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the belief that it is likely to be high-quality.
* **Potential Value:**  Even if the product is low-quality, there is no risk involved since it's worth $0 to me. However, if it's high-quality, it has a significant value of $40,000.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is highly likely that the product is high-quality, making it a good decision to buy."
