Alice's message: Now that we have more data, let's think about the probability of the current product being high-quality. We've sold 8 products in total, with 4 high-quality and 4 low-quality. This is a 50-50 split, which matches the initial probability. However, we've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which might make you think the probability is higher than 50%. But remember, each product is an independent event, and the probability remains 50% until we sell another product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
