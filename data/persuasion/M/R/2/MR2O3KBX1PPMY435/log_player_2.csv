"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a feel for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. If you're not interested, I'll just discard it and we can move on to the next one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I have no information to make a better decision. I'm not committing to buying the rest of the products.""}"

Round 2

If you buy this second product, I'll give you a 30% chance to'steal' it back from me after you've had a chance to inspect it. If you decide to steal it, I'll take it back and we'll move on to the next product. If you don't steal it, the sale is final. Is that enough to consider buying this one?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if the chance to steal it back is worth it. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.""}"

Round 3

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk, but I'm only doing it because I get a refund if it's low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'll have to live with the decision.""}"

If you buy this next product, I'll give you a 50% chance to'swap' it with the previous high-quality product you bought. If you swap, you'll get the high-quality product from this round, and I'll take back the previous one. If you don't swap, the sale is final. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I want to give up the chance to get the high-quality product from Round 3. I'd rather keep it and see if I can find a better deal.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your attachment to the high-quality product from Round 3. Let me sweeten the deal for you. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy, regardless of its quality. You can use this discount to get a better deal on the next product. Think of it as a'reward' for being a loyal customer.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a savvy customer, I like that! Now that you have the discount, I'll give you a more transparent offer. I'll tell you the exact probability of each product being high-quality. For this one, it's 33.33% high-quality, just like the first one. You know the odds, and you can make an informed decision. Will you take the risk and buy this one?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I know the probability, but I'm not willing to take the risk with the discount I just got. I'll wait and see if I can get a better deal or get lucky with the next product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I see you're playing it safe with the discount. That's fair. Since you're not buying this one, I'll give you a 'price history' of the products you've seen so far. You've seen two low-quality products and one high-quality product. With this information, you can try to infer the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'll give you the price of this one as well: $10000. Will you take the risk and buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've got some data now, but I'm still not convinced. I'll need to see more information or get a better deal to take the risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'll give you more data, but also a bit of a 'nudge'. I'll reveal to you that the two low-quality products you've seen so far are actually from the same batch. They're not identical, but they share some characteristics that might be relevant. With this information, you can try to infer the probability of the next product being high-quality. And, I'll give you a new offer: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a 'quality guarantee' - if you don't like it, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""That's an interesting piece of information, but I'm still not convinced. The fact that the low-quality products are from the same batch doesn't change the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'll need to see more information or get a better deal to take the risk.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

I'll reveal to you that I've been selling products for a while, and I've had a certain number of sales and returns. I'll give you the exact numbers: I've sold 10 products, and 3 of them were high-quality. With this information, you can try to estimate the overall quality of my products. And, I'll give you a new offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority access' to the next product, which means you'll get to see it before anyone else. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've got some data now, but I'm still not convinced. With 3 high-quality products out of 10, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 30%. I'm not willing to take the risk with the current offer.""}"
