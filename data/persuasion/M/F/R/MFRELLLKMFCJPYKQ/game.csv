low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers who received recommendations from you to buy the product didn't end up buying it, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and the probability of a low-quality product has increased. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
