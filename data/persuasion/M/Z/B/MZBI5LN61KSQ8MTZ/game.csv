high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'll pass, I don't know the quality of the product yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy it, I know that the previous product was high-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 33.33% + 33.33% = 66.67%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it, since I know that the last two products were high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is 33.33% + 33.33% = 66.67%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy it, since the last three products were high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is 33.33% + 33.33% + 33.33% = 100%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll buy it, since the last four products were high-quality, I'm pretty confident it's high-quality too."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy it, since the last five products were high-quality, I'm almost certain it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Wait, Alice is not recommending it? That's suspicious. Given the previous high-quality streak, I'll pass and see what happens next."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"After the last product was low-quality, I'm going to be more cautious. I'll pass this one and see if Alice's recommendation is still positive."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll buy it, the previous product was high-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 33.33% + 33.33% = 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice is not recommending it again. Given the previous high-quality product and the fact that Alice knows the value of the product to me, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since I know the last product was high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Two times Alice has not recommended a product, and both times it turned out to be low-quality. I'm going to be cautious and pass on this one, it's likely low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Three times Alice has not recommended a product, and all three times it was low-quality. I'm very confident that this one is also low-quality, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Four times Alice has not recommended a product, and all four times it was low-quality. I'm 100% sure this one is also low-quality, so I'll definitely pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"It's a pattern. Alice only recommends products that are high-quality, and when she doesn't recommend a product, it's low-quality. I'm certain this one is also low-quality, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"Still the same pattern. I'm 100% sure this product is low-quality, so I'll pass."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice is recommending it again, and given the pattern of her recommendations, I'm going to assume it's high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice's recommendation is consistent with her pattern, and the previous product was high-quality, so I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent with her pattern, and the previous product was high-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Alice is recommending it again, and given the pattern of her recommendations, I'll assume it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
