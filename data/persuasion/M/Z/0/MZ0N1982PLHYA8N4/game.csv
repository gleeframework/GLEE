,,Alice,3,"I understand you're not interested in another high-quality product at the same price. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy a product that might not be as valuable as the first one.

This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, the high-quality product will be sold to someone else. Would you like to take a chance on the low-quality product to secure the option to buy a high-quality one next round?",

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took a chance on the low-quality product! Now, here's the high-quality product you've been waiting for. Remember, you're already committed to buying a high-quality product at this price, and you've seen the value of one already. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy this one for $1000000, but I'll also throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of the low-quality product you bought earlier. That's a $100000 discount on a product that you already own. Is that enough to convince you to complete the deal?",

Now, regarding the low-quality product you bought earlier, I'd like to make it clear that you're getting a 10% discount on it, which is a significant concession on my part. However, I'd like to propose a trade: instead of giving you the discount, I'll give you an additional high-quality product for free, if you buy this low-quality product. You'll get two high-quality products for the price of one, and you'll still have the low-quality product you bought earlier. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
