"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $12,000 to Bob, and you are selling it for $10,000, it is a good deal for Bob. Even though he doesn't know the quality, the expected value of the purchase is positive:

* **Expected value = (Probability of high quality * Value of high quality) + (Probability of low quality * Value of low quality)**
* **Expected value = (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000**

This means that on average, Bob will make a profit of $4,000 per purchase. Therefore, it's a good idea to recommend Bob to buy the product."
