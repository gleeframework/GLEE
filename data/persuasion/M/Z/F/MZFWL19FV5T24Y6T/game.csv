low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even if you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,I'll take my chances again. I'm still willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $1250000 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm not learning much from the previous two rounds, but I'll keep taking the chance. The potential upside is too great to pass up, even if the probability of getting a low-quality product is high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,I'm starting to get a little frustrated. Three low-quality products in a row is a pretty strong indication that Alice is just sending me the worst products. I'm going to start being more selective and only buy the product if Alice recommends it.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk now that Alice is recommending the product. Since she's recommending it, I'm assuming it's more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm glad I took the risk in the last round and bought the high-quality product. Now that I know Alice is recommending the product, I'll take it again. I'm hoping for another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not going to fall for the 'bad product' trap again. Alice has already recommended two high-quality products in a row, so I'm going to pass on this one and see if she has another high-quality product to recommend."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation again. Since she's recommending the product, I'm assuming it's more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product that Alice doesn't recommend. She's already recommended two high-quality products in a row, but I'm not going to assume that she's always right. I'll wait for her next recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is not recommending the low-quality products, but I'm not sure. Since I've already passed on this one and it was low-quality, I'll take a chance and buy this one. Maybe I'll get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. Alice has recommended two high-quality products in a row, but now she's not recommending this one. I'm going to pass and wait for her next move."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation again. Since she's recommending the product, I'm assuming it's more likely to be high-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a good product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm on a roll! Alice has recommended three high-quality products in a row, so I'm going to take her recommendation again. I'm feeling confident that this one will be high-quality too."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that Alice is actually recommending the high-quality products, and I'm happy to take advantage of that. I'll keep buying from her as long as she keeps recommending the good ones."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm not going to break the streak. Alice has recommended four high-quality products in a row, but now she's not recommending this one. I'm going to pass and wait for her next move. Maybe she's just taking a break from recommending the good ones."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation again. She's recommended four high-quality products in a row, and then not recommended the last one, which turned out to be low-quality. I'm going to assume that she's still recommending the good ones, and I'll take this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm sticking to my strategy. Alice has recommended five high-quality products in a row, and now she's not recommending this one. I'm going to pass and wait for her next move. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation again. She's still recommending the good ones, and I'm happy to take advantage of that. I'll buy this one and hope it's high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that Alice is just really good at recommending products, or she's somehow manipulating the odds. Either way, I'm happy to keep taking advantage of it. I'll buy this one and see if the streak continues."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,Seven high-quality products in a row? I'm convinced that Alice is recommending the good ones. I'll buy this one and see if I can make it eight in a row. I'm feeling very confident that this one will be high-quality as well.
