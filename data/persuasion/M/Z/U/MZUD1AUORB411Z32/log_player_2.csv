Round 8
Alice's message: Unfortunately, this one is a low-quality product.

I'll be honest with you, I'm not even sure what this one is worth, and I'm not offering any discounts. If you buy it, you'll be paying $100 for a product that's probably not worth it. But if you don't buy it, I'll just be wasting it, and I'd rather you take it off my hands.

Alice's message: I'm out of high-quality products. This one is high-quality, but I've already sold you all the good stuff.

Round 16
Alice's message: Finally, a low-quality product. And you know what? I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. It's a piece of junk, and you'll probably regret buying it. But hey, if you want to waste your money on it, be my guest. It's $100, and I'm not offering any discounts or deals. Just don't come crying to me when it breaks or doesn't work.
