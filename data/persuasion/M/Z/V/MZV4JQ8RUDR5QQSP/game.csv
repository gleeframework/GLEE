,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I don't trust your recommendations, since they might be biased by the low-quality products you've been selling."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, which is the same as the initial probability. I'm not seeing any reason to believe that Alice's recommendation is based on any information that would change the probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 products recommended were sold, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality, and I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might be due to a low-quality product being sold to the previous 8 buyers, which would make it more likely that the current product is also low quality."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to recommend against it?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 8 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that all 8 products were low-quality. If this trend continues, there's a 66.67% chance this product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice recommends to buy, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the fact that 8 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected."
