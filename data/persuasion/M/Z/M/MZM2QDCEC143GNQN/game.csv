,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?"

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 buyers bought the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 or 0.75. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll pass on the product to see if the next buyer will buy it, which might give me a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 buyers have bought the product and all 3 high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very high, but it's still only 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."

,,Alice,18,yes,
