Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what the quality of the product is, and even if it's high quality, I know I can buy it for $120, so I'm not willing to pay $100 for it.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to take on the risk, but I still don't know what the quality of the product is, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.""}"

Alice's message: I've got a great one for you! This product is one of the best I have, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, which is a steal considering its true value. Think of it as a 'lottery ticket' - there's a 50% chance you'll get a product worth $120, and a 50% chance you'll get a product worth $0. But I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm passing the savings on to you. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand that you're taking on the risk, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a better offer or try to negotiate a lower price.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take you up on your offer. I'll buy the product and get a refund if it's low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'll keep it and save $20.""}"

If you buy this one, I'll give you a 10% discount, so you'll get it for $90. That's a steal considering its true value of $120. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to pay $90 for a product that might be worth $120.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a free upgrade. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come up and pay the full price for it.""}"
