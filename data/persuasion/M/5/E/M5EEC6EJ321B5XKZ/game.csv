,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on considering this exceptional opportunity! With a track record of 0/0 sales, I'm confident that this product will be a game-changer for you. As a special offer, I'm willing to let it go for the unbeatable price of $1000000. Don't miss out on this chance to make a statement!",
,,the buyer,1,"Since there is no sales record and I have no information about the quality of this specific product, I will rely on the general probability of 80% high-quality products. However, without additional information or a better offer, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at this price.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution in the previous round. Let me offer you a unique insight: since I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 100%! With this new information, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal: $999000 for this exceptional product. Don't miss this chance to own a high-quality product at a discounted price!",
,,the buyer,2,"The offered price is higher than the expected value of the product based on the given probabilities, so I will pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the price. Let me offer you a more transparent approach. Since I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 100%! Given this certainty, I'm willing to offer you a more competitive price of $1150000. This is a one-time opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price closer to its true value. Will you take advantage of this chance?",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the chance based on the original probabilities and potential value.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations to the previous buyer! Now, let's focus on this new opportunity. With 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is even higher at 100%! I'm willing to offer you a special deal, considering your trust in my products. For this high-quality product, I'll give you an exclusive price of $1200000, which is even lower than its true value. Don't miss this chance to own a high-quality product at an unbeatable price!",
,,the buyer,4,"I won't buy it. The price you're offering is $1200000 which is the same value of the product if it is high-quality, and given that there is still a chance that the product could be low-quality, I don't see this as a good deal.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns. Let me offer you a different approach. Since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 100%! However, I'm willing to take on some of the risk and offer you a price that's slightly lower than its true value. For this high-quality product, I'll give you an exclusive price of $1190000. This is a unique opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price that's still above its expected value. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,5,"Although the discounted price is attractive, I still need to consider the overall probability of 80% for a high-quality product. Your sales record, while impressive, is still limited to only 2 sales. I'm not convinced that the probability is indeed 100%. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution. I'd like to provide some additional context to alleviate your concerns. Since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 100%! However, I'm willing to offer you an even more competitive price to make up for any remaining uncertainty. For this high-quality product, I'll give you an exclusive price of $1180000. This is an exceptional deal that's hard to come by. Will you take the chance to own a high-quality product at a price that's still above its expected value?",
,,the buyer,6,"Based on the provided probabilities of product quality and the expected value calculation, purchasing at this price does not align with my best interest.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your decision-making process. Let me offer you a different approach. Instead of focusing on the probability of the product being high-quality, let's consider the potential upside. If this product is indeed high-quality, it's worth $1200000 to you. Even if there's a 20% chance it's low-quality, the expected value is still $240000. Considering the potential upside, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1100000. This is a unique opportunity to own a product with significant potential value at a price that's still below its expected value. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your creative approach, Alice. However, I must consider not just the potential upside but also the risk. Given the 20% chance of the product being low-quality and thus worth $0 to me, I'm not convinced that the price of $1100000 adequately reflects the risk I'm taking. The expected value calculation you provided assumes I have the budget and willingness to absorb a potential total loss, which isn't the case. Therefore, I must decline your offer.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns about the risk. Let me offer you a compromise. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 so far, I'm willing to offer you a price that's even more competitive. For this high-quality product, I'll give you an exclusive price of $1080000. This is a unique opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price that's still above its expected value, while also acknowledging the risk involved. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,8,The provided statistics and the offered price do not align with my calculated expected value of the product. I decline the offer.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,

With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm confident in the quality of this product. I'll offer you a price of $1050000, which is a 12.5% discount from the true value of $1200000. This is a one-time opportunity to own a high-quality product at a competitive price. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,10,"The expected value is less than the asking price, so it's not a good deal on average.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to own a product that's worth $0 to most buyers. However, I believe that with the right mindset and strategy, you can turn this product into a valuable asset. I'll offer you this low-quality product for $500000, which is a significant discount from its true value of $0. This is a chance to think outside the box and create value where others see none. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your creative sales pitch, but I'll have to pass on this low-quality product. Its true value is $0, and I don't see any potential for turning it into a valuable asset. I'll wait for a high-quality product that's worth $1200000 to me.",no

You'll also have the chance to inspect the product before purchasing. Will you take the chance to own a high-quality product at a competitive price?",
,,the buyer,14,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but based on the information provided, I notice that you mentioned this is a high-quality product. However, given that there's still a 20% chance of it being low quality, and considering I have no way to verify its quality beyond your word, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price. The discount is attractive, but the potential loss of $1050000 if the product turns out to be of low quality outweighs the potential gain. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no

,,the buyer,15,"Based on the provided statistics, it appears that all products sold so far have been high-quality, which suggests a possible positive correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality. Considering the significant discount offered, which reduces the initial risk, and the additional guarantee of a full refund and a 10% discount on the next purchase if the product is low-quality, I believe the risk-reward tradeoff is favorable. Therefore, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product at the revised price.",yes

,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate your creative sales pitch, Alice, but given the product's value to me is $0, I'll have to pass on this offer. The price of $50000 is still too high for something that holds no value to me.",no
