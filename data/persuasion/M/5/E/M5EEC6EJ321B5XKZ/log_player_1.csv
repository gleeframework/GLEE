This is a unique opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price that's still above its expected value. Will you take the chance?""}"
"The buyer's message: Although the discounted price is attractive, I still need to consider the overall probability of 80% for a high-quality product.

Instead of focusing on the probability of the product being high-quality, let's consider the potential upside. If this product is indeed high-quality, it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Even if there's a 20% chance it's low-quality, the expected value is still $240,000. Considering the potential upside, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to own a product with significant potential value at a price that's still below its expected value. Will you take the chance?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your creative approach, Alice. However, I must consider not just the potential upside but also the risk. Given the 20% chance of the product being low-quality and thus worth $0 to me, I'm not convinced that the price of $1100000 adequately reflects the risk I'm taking. The expected value calculation you provided assumes I have the budget and willingness to absorb a potential total loss, which isn't the case. Therefore, I must decline your offer.
