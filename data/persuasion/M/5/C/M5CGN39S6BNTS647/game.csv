,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. Given the probability, it's likely that this product is also high-quality.

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. However, I want to be upfront with you - the last two products I sold were purchased quickly, and I'm starting to think that people are getting a little too eager. I'm not sure if I should be selling at this price point anymore. $1000000 might be a bit steep for this product. I'm willing to consider a lower offer, but I need to know you're willing to walk away if it's not a good deal for you.",

I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one, but I want to be transparent about the risks. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll make a great profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll be out $1000000. I'm offering you a 50/50 chance of a $2000000 gain, but I need you to be aware of the potential loss.",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 products so far, and 5 of them were high-quality. However, I want to be upfront with you - the last two products I sold were high-quality, and I'm starting to worry that I've given away my secrets. I'm not sure if I should be selling at this price point anymore. I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of $500000 off the price, making it $500000. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're feeling lucky.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. I think it's safe to say that the probability of a high-quality product is now higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account the new probability. I'll sell this product to you for $1200000, which is a premium price, but I believe it's justified given the increased likelihood of it being high-quality.

However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep selling at this price point forever. I'm willing to offer you a deal, but I need to be upfront with you: I'm starting to think that the price of $1200000 is too low for a product that's this likely to be high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, but I'm not willing to negotiate further. It's a premium price, but I believe it's justified given the odds.",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is a fraction of its original price. It's not a great deal, but it's a deal nonetheless. If you're desperate for a bargain, this might be the opportunity you're looking for.",
