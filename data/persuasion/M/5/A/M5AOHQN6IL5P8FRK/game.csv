high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it's unknown whether it's high-quality or not. I've sold a total of 2 products now, with 1 unknown and 0 high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the first product sold has already been purchased, and it's possible that it was high-quality, which would mean that the probability of this one being high-quality is now 50%.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 known to be high-quality and 1 known to be low-quality. I've sold a total of 3 products now. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the first product sold was purchased, and the second one was just sold, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%. However, since the second product was purchased, it's possible that the seller is trying to get rid of low-quality products quickly, which might indicate that this one is also low-quality.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 known to be high-quality and 1 known to be low-quality. I've sold a total of 4 products now. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. Given the fact that 2 out of the last 2 products sold were high-quality, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality has increased. I'm not giving away any information about the first product sold, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take a chance on this product, considering the increased probability of high-quality products based on the last 2 sales.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, with 3 known to be high-quality and 1 known to be low-quality. I've sold a total of 5 products now. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. The fact that 3 out of the last 3 products sold were high-quality suggests a strong likelihood that the probability of a product being high-quality has increased. I'm willing to take a chance on this product and sell it to you for the full price, hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm willing to take a chance on this product. With 3 high-quality products out of the last 3 sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed higher. I'll take the product for $1000000.",yes

However, I want to be upfront with you - the last two products sold were high-quality, and I'm worried that I might be stuck with a bunch of low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the full price, but I'm not making any promises about its quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take a chance on the product, but I'll make an educated guess based on the statistics. With 3 high-quality products out of 5 sold, I think there's a 60% chance that this product is high-quality. Given the price, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll pay the full price of $1000000.",yes

Given the fact that 4 out of the last 4 products sold were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 60%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the full price, but I'm not making any promises about the exact probability of it being high-quality.",

I'm being completely honest, I've had a string of bad luck with the last five products, and I'm starting to think that I should just shut down my business. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the full price, but I'm not making any promises about its quality.
