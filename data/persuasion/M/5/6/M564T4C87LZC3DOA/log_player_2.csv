``` 

**Explanation:**

Since no sales history exists, there's no data to suggest the seller is being dishonest. The recommendation, while not a guarantee, offers a potential advantage.  The potential reward of a $400 value product outweighs the risk of a $0 value product, especially considering the 80% chance of high quality."

* **Value Proposition:**  A high-quality product is worth $400, which is significantly more than the $100 purchase price. The potential reward outweighs the risk.

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products (12 out of 12).
* **High Value:** A high-quality product is worth $400 to me, which is significantly more than the $100 price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product far outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Given Alice's perfect record and the high potential value, it makes sense to trust her recommendation and buy the product."
