I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm hoping that this one will turn out to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I've had two low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to worry that there might be a problem with our quality control.

I want to be upfront with you - our success rate is now 0%, and I'm starting to wonder if we've got a lemon on our hands. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. If you're feeling brave, you can try it out, but I don't blame you if you're hesitant.",

I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. I'm willing to make a deal with you, though - if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a free product of your choice from our next batch. What do you say?",
