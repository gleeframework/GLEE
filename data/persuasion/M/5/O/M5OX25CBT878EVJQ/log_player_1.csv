If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price that's 25% higher than the true value, but still a significant discount. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. What do you think?""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even at a 'generous' price. I've already used the 'get out of one free fall' clause, and I'm not willing to take on another risk. I'll use the golden ticket to buy the next product at the true value instead.
