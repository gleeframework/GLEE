,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the probability of it being high-quality and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $10000 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I think you might be trying to scare people away, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what is the probability of a product being high-quality based on the current sales record?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems like your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers all bought the product despite Alice's recommendation, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, or that the previous buyers were not paying attention to the statistics. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 3 buyers, and the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products before me and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information or have a different approach to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds or if there's a change in the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that 3 other buyers have also bought, and none of them got a high-quality product. Given the low success rate, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather not take the risk."
