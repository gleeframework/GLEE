**Explanation:**

Even though the product has a higher probability of being low quality, there's still a chance it's high quality.  As the first buyer, there's no data to suggest Alice is biased towards recommending low-quality products.  Since the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($40,000), it's worth the risk in this scenario."
