``` 
Here's why I'm recommending the purchase even though the previous record is poor:

* **The buyer is unaware of the individual product quality:** The buyer only sees the overall sales record.  They don't know that the last few products have been high-quality.
* **The product's actual quality:** The product is high-quality, making it a great value for the buyer. 
* **The 80% probability:** The buyer knows the overall probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%.  While the sales record is bad, it's important to remember that it could simply be a streak of bad luck.

**It's a calculated risk for the buyer:**  They could lose $100 if it's low-quality, but they stand to gain $200 if it's high-quality.  The odds are in their favor."
