This product I'm offering now is also high-quality, and I'm willing to make a statement that will put my future sales at risk if I'm lying. If this product sells and is found to be low-quality, I'll disclose that information to all future buyers, which would likely harm my chances of making future sales.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. I understand that my sales record so far has been a major obstacle in building trust with potential buyers. I want to acknowledge that I've had eight opportunities to sell products, and none of the high-quality products I've claimed to have offered have been sold.

This is a significant risk for me, as it would mean giving up any potential future sales. I'm willing to take this risk because I'm confident that this product is of high quality.
