Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the previous buyer passed on the product, I can infer that they must have known that the probability of the product being high-quality was greater than 50% (since they would have bought it if it were below 50%). This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is at least 50%.

However, since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the previous buyer passed on the product, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still above 50%.

I will give the buyer the following message:
