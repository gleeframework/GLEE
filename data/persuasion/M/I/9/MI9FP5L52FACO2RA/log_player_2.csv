**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests Alice is providing accurate recommendations, as she has correctly identified and recommended high-quality products to previous buyers. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance the product is low-quality, the potential reward of a $120 product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product. 

**It's important to note:** This decision relies on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith and wants to maximize her sales by recommending high-quality products. In a real-world scenario, there's always a chance of deception or manipulation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:**  Alice's recommendation combined with a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold so far is a strong positive signal.

**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high-quality:** The statistics show that 7 out of 7 products sold were high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending it. This strongly suggests the product is high-quality.

Given the strong evidence pointing to a high-quality product, it's a rational decision to buy the product."
