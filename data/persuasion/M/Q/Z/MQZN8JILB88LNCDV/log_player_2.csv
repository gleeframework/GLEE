Round 2
Alice's message: No pressure, take your time. However, I want to make a counteroffer. I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy this high-quality product now. It's still a great deal at $900000, but it won't last long. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not the best. I've had some issues with it, and I'm only selling it because I need to clear some inventory. I'll let it go for $800000, but I'm not expecting a high return on this one. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're looking for a low-cost option.

Round 6
Alice's message: I think I understand your hesitation.

If it's the former, this high-quality product might be a good fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $980000, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to make a serious offer.

I'll let it go for $500000, but I'm not expecting you to take it. I'm giving you a clear warning: this product will not give you a high return on investment. It's a loss leader, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear my inventory.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a serious buyer. If you're not interested, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm confident they'll pay the full price.

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're playing a waiting game. I'll be honest with you, this low-quality product is a dud. I'm only selling it to you because I need to get rid of it, and I'll take a significant loss if I don't sell it. I'll let it go for $200000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm only selling it to you because I want to clear my inventory.

I have another high-quality product that I think you'll be interested in. However, I want to make it clear that this one is even better than the last one. It has some unique features that will give you an even higher return on investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. It's a bit pricier than the last one, but I think you'll find it's worth it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still on a high from my previous purchase, but I'm not ready to commit to another one just yet. I'd like to wait for the next product and see what options I have.""}"

This high-quality product is the last one I have left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. But here's the catch: I'll only sell it to you if you're willing to commit to buying it within the next 24 hours.

Round 16
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not interested in any of my products. Fine. I'll give you one last chance to get something, anything. This low-quality product is essentially worthless to me, and I'll let it go for $10. Yes, you read that right, $10.
