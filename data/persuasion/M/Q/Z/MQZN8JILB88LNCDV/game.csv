high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No pressure, take your time. However, I want to make a counteroffer. I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy this high-quality product now. It's still a great deal at $900000, but it won't last long. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not ready to make a decision yet. I'd like to wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,3,I understand you're being cautious. I'll make a more straightforward offer this time. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $950000. It's a fair price considering its quality and the fact that you'll be getting it at a discount from the original price. What do you say?,
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the straightforward offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to wait for the next product and see what options I have.",no

,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're not taking my offers seriously. Let me make it clear: this high-quality product is a rare gem. I'm willing to sell it to you for $980000, which is the lowest price I've ever offered. If you don't take it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else. The offer is on the table, and I'm waiting for your response.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not the best. I've had some issues with it, and I'm only selling it because I need to clear some inventory. I'll let it go for $800000, but I'm not expecting a high return on this one. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're looking for a low-cost option.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in a product with issues, even at a low price. I'd like to wait for the next product and see what options I have.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think I understand your hesitation. Let me ask you a question: are you looking for a product that will give you a good return on investment, or are you looking for a product that will give you a high return on investment? If it's the former, this high-quality product might be a good fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $980000, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to make a serious offer.",

I'll let it go for $500000, but I'm not expecting you to take it. I'm giving you a clear warning: this product will not give you a high return on investment. It's a loss leader, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear my inventory.",

It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's still reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a serious buyer.

,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think you're playing a waiting game. I'll be honest with you, this low-quality product is a dud. I'm only selling it to you because I need to get rid of it, and I'll take a significant loss if I don't sell it. I'll let it go for $200000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm only selling it to you because I want to clear my inventory.",

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase, but I'm starting to think you're dragging your feet. Let me make a bold statement: this high-quality product is the best one I have left. It's the crème de la crème, the cream of the crop. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000, but only because I think you'll appreciate its true value.

This high-quality product is the last one I have left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. But here's the catch: I'll only sell it to you if you're willing to commit to buying it within the next 24 hours.

,,Alice,14,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you took the risk and committed to buying the last high-quality product. Now, let's move on to the next product. I have to be honest with you, this one is not as good as the last two. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting much return on investment. I'll let it go for $50000, but I'm only doing it because I need to clear my inventory. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm essentially giving it away.",
