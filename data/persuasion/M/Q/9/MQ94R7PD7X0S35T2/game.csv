low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, as the potential reward is worth it. I'm also considering the fact that the first buyer didn't buy the product, which might indicate a lower proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $1000000 product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping that the product might be high quality, given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this is consistent with my expectations. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it, which might suggest it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and update my understanding of the situation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, which are worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and observe more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that 5 out of 5 buyers have passed on the product. Given the low quality of the products that were previously sold, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Your recommendation doesn't change the probability of the product being high or low quality, but it might be worth a shot since it's a 33.33% chance of being high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $1000000 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the current product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products have been low-quality so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the statistics, it seems that all products recommended by you so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to be recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 8th buyer and I'm curious to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate. I'm not basing my decision on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the last buyer and I don't want to let the product go to waste."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
