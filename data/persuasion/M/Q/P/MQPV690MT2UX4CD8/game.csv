high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended all 3 previous products that were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if Alice's recommendation is any more reliable."

,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers all received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a good deal on a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if the low quality products are being sold or not. Can you tell me how many low-quality products have been sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm skeptical about the product given Alice's recommendation and the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer has a better luck.

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, I infer that the product is likely to be low quality. Since the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than 0. This makes me even more confident in my decision to pass on this product."
