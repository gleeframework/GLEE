high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 5.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
