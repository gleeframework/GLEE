* **Statistics:** The buyer now has a clearer picture of your track record: 3 products sold, 3 high-quality. This strengthens the perception that you sell high-quality products.
* **Transparency:** While you may not be able to influence the buyer's perception of your previous actions, you can still be transparent and recommend the purchase based on the current product's quality.
