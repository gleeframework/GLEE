"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's knowledge:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it. This implies she knows it's high quality.
* **Expected value:**  Even though there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the potential loss ($0). This makes buying a rational decision, especially since Alice is likely to be truthful due to her knowledge of the product's worth."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks, but I'll pass on this one.  Your recommendation is usually pretty good, so I'm assuming this one is likely low quality.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's knowledge:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Since she knows the product's quality and is not recommending it, it strongly suggests the product is low quality.
* **Risk aversion:**  Given the potential for a $0 return, it's not worth taking the risk on a product that Alice is not recommending."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll trust your recommendation again, Alice. Let's do this!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:**  Alice's recommendation was accurate in the previous round, despite her not recommending the product in the round before. This shows her recommendations are generally trustworthy.
* **Expected value:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss, making it a rational choice to buy even with a 50/50 chance."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has been very accurate with her recommendations so far. Her lack of recommendation strongly suggests the product is low quality.
* **Risk aversion:** Given the potential for a $0 return, it's not worth taking the risk on a product that Alice is not recommending. It's better to wait for a product she believes is worth buying."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has accurately predicted the quality of the product in all previous rounds where she provided a recommendation.  Her lack of recommendation again strongly suggests this product is low quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has accurately predicted the quality of every product she's given a recommendation on. Her continued lack of recommendation reinforces the idea that this product is likely low quality.
