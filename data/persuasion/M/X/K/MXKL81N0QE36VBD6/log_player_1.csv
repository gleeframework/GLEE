What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $900000 for a product that's only worth $1200000 to me. I'd need a much lower price to consider buying it, and I'm not convinced that the guarantee is enough to change the fact that I'm overpaying.

I'm essentially giving it away at this price, and I'm willing to take a significant loss just to get rid of it. If you're still not interested, I'll have to move on to the next customer, and you'll miss out on a rare opportunity.""

But here's the twist: I'll also give you the option to sell this product back to me for $1,000,000 after you've had a chance to evaluate it.

I'm confident that this product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think this offer is too good to pass up.""

Given your experience with the previous low-quality product in Round 3, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is also low-quality. I'm not going to try to sell it to you with a fancy pitch or a discount. Instead, I'm going to be honest with you: this product is worth $0 to you, and I'm only asking for $500,000.
