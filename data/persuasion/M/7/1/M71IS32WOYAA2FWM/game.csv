,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of Alice's recommendation and the current statistics. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, considering the previous two buyers didn't find a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality and its value to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is no. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the low price of $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see a change in Alice's recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality, and I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If all previous 5 buyers were given the product and none of them bought it, it's likely that the product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I can save $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product rather than any objective assessment. I'd like to wait for a product that hasn't been recommended to buy, or at least get more information about the product before making a decision."
