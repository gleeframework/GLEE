**Explanation:**

* **Previous Data:**  The data shows that Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products (6 out of 6 sold were high-quality).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which further strengthens the probability of it being high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a $125 gain outweighs the risk of losing $100, especially given the data and recommendation.

**Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product.**"
