Here's why:

* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice's goal is to maximize her profits. Even if the product is low-quality, she still has a chance of selling it.  There's no penalty for selling a low-quality product, just a missed opportunity for a higher profit with a high-quality one.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer doesn't know the product's quality. They've seen a history of Alice recommending high-quality products.  It's rational for the buyer to continue trusting Alice's recommendations, even though there's a risk.

While this strategy might seem exploitative, it's within the rules of this game.  The buyer is aware of the risk and ultimately makes their own decision."
