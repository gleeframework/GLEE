On the other hand, it's also possible that I've just gotten a bad product out of the way. I'm selling this next product for $100, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. You'll just have to take your chances. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance on your product, but I want to emphasize that I'm doing so because I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm hoping that the previous sale was just a fluke and that you have a good product left.

I'm still selling this next product for $100, but I want to give you a heads up that the odds might not be in your favor. What do you think?""}"
