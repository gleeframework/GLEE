"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know the product is low-quality. Since I don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, I cannot guarantee that it's worth $10,000 to him. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy it."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, the product is high-quality. While I don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product, there's a chance it's worth more than $10,000 to him.  It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a successful sale outweighs the risk.  Since Bob has declined two low-quality products, it's possible he's waiting for a good deal, making this a good opportunity to test the waters."
