However, I can tell you that they all made their purchasing decisions based on the information I provided, just like you are now. As for the law of averages, I understand your point about the 3 high-quality products in a row. However, I'd like to remind you that the law of averages is a statistical concept that applies to large samples, not individual sequences.
