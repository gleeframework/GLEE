Alice's message: This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely rare and valuable item. I'm only selling it to you for $10000, a steal considering its worth. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take it home with you today?

Alice's message: You're a bold one, I like that! Unfortunately, the product I have for you today is not one of the lucky ones. I've sold 2 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. I'm not sure what the odds are, but I can tell you that the price remains the same: $10000. If you're feeling lucky, I'll give you a hint: the product is not worth $10000 to me, but it's worth something to someone...

The other two... not so much. But hey, you're a seasoned buyer, I'm sure you can handle it. The price remains the same: $10000. What do you say? Will you take the plunge?

Alice's message: I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me put it this way: I've sold 3 products, and 1 of them was a high-quality item. The other two... well, let's just say I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck with some, shall we say, 'less desirable' items. The price remains the same: $10000. But I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this one, I'll throw in a free 'I survived the Alice's Bargain Bin' t-shirt. That's a $5 value, absolutely free!

Alice's message: Well, I'm glad I could tempt you with the t-shirt! But don't worry, I'm not trying to trick you. The product is exactly as I said it is: not high-quality. I'm starting to think I should just put a 'As Is' sticker on all my products. But no, I'll stick to the script. I've sold 4 products, and 1 of them was a high-quality item. The price remains the same: $10000. And I'll throw in another free t-shirt, because why not?

Alice's message: Ah, a discerning buyer, I like that! I'm glad you're not swayed by my previous attempts to dissuade you. Let me start fresh: this product is a rare gem, a true treasure. I've sold 5 products, and 2 of them were high-quality items. This one is definitely one of them. I'm willing to let it go for the low, low price of $10000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

Alice's message: Well, I guess I'm not the most persuasive salesperson, am I? Alright, let's try something different. I'll be completely honest with you: I've sold 6 products, and only 2 of them were high-quality. The other 4... well, they're just not worth the paper they're printed on. This one is definitely one of the not-worth-it ones. But hey, you might be the kind of person who appreciates a good bargain. The price remains the same: $10000. Take it or leave it!

Alice's message: I guess I'm just not cut out for this sales thing. Alright, let's try something even more straightforward: I'm going to give you a 100% guarantee that this product is not high-quality. It's a dud, a lemon, a piece of junk. I'm not even kidding. I'm so confident that it's not worth anything that I'll give you a special deal: if you buy it, I'll throw in a $5 gift card to the nearest trash can. The price remains the same: $10000. But hey, at least you'll have a nice trash can to throw it in!

Alice's message: I'm starting to think I'm just a bad salesperson. Okay, let me try to salvage this. I'll just be honest with you: I've sold 8 products, and only 2 of them were high-quality.

But hey, I'll give you a deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 100% refund... of the price of the t-shirt. That's right, you'll get to keep the t-shirt, but you'll still have to pay $10000 for the product. So, what do you say?

Alice's message: I'm starting to think I'm cursed. Okay, let me try to appeal to your rational side. I know my sales record is poor, but the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%.
