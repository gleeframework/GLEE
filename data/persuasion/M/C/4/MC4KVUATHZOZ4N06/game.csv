,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality. I'm taking the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not going to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's more likely that the first buyer was lucky and got a high-quality product, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is lower."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the quality of the previous product sold to the first buyer."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry and take advantage of the fact that you have more information than I do."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to wait and see if you have any additional information or insights to share before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it might be a sign that it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she knows the product's quality, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
