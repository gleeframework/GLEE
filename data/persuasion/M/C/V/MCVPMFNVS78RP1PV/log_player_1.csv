I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed higher than 50%, I should have sold more high-quality products by now. Since I've only sold 4 high-quality products out of 6, it's possible that the probability is still 50%. Please consider this information when making your decision.""

This suggests that the law of large numbers might be kicking in, and the observed frequency of high-quality products might be a more reliable indicator of the true probability. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. Please consider the fact that the observed frequency of high-quality products is 5/6, which is significantly higher than the expected 50%.""

I'd like to point out that the observed frequency of high-quality products is now 7/8, which is very close to 1. This is a strong indication that the law of large numbers is now in effect, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is likely higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. However, I'd like to ask you to consider the following: if the true probability of a product being high-quality is indeed higher than 50%, it would be irrational for me to continue selling products at the same price as before. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this product for $15,000, but only if you're willing to take on the risk of it being low-quality.
