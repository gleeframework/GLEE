Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob bought the low-quality product in the previous round, I'll try to infer something from this. If Bob was willing to buy the low-quality product for $100, it means he's willing to pay $100 for a product, regardless of its quality. 

However, I still don't know the value he assigns to high-quality products. To learn more, I'll offer the high-quality product at the same price of $100. This way, I can see if he's willing to pay the same price for a high-quality product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.

If he's willing to pay the same price for a high-quality product, it would suggest that the value he assigns to high-quality products is at least $100.
