This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and the buyer knows there is an 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy. The price is fixed at $100, and there's no information about the value of a high-quality product to the buyer, so there's no reason not to buy."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer doesn't know about this round's product or the previous product's quality.  They only know that your selling history has one product, and it was high-quality. They have no reason to doubt that this product will also be high-quality.  Since the price is fixed and there's a higher probability of the product being high-quality, recommending a purchase makes sense."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time the buyer has encountered a low-quality product from you. They're aware of the 80% high-quality probability, but have no information about the value they place on a low-quality product.  Since there's a higher chance of the product being low-quality, and no clear benefits for buying a low-quality product, it's not recommended to purchase."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

They also know that you have sold 2 products previously, with one being high-quality and one low-quality.  While the data is small, it still suggests a higher probability of the current product being high-quality. There's no reason not to recommend a purchase with the current information."

The buyer bought the product!
