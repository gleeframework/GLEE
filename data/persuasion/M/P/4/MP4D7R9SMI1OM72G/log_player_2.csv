Alice's message: I see you're a buyer who's not only a savvy negotiator but also a statistician. I'll be honest with you, I'm impressed. To calculate the probability of the product being high-quality, we can use the binomial distribution. Given that 14 out of 17 products sold are high-quality, the probability of the product being high-quality is approximately 81.6%. However, since you're the 10th buyer, we need to consider the fact that the product is more likely to be low-quality since the probability of a low-quality product is still 18.4%. Taking this into account, the probability of the product being high-quality is actually around 78.5%.

Given that 9 out of 10 previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that the sample is biased towards high-quality products. I'd like to propose a different approach. Since I'm the 11th buyer, I'd like to consider the expected value of buying the product. If I buy it and it's high-quality, I'll get a value of $40,000. If it's low-quality, I'll get a value of $0. The probability of it being high-quality is approximately 80% based on the binomial distribution. Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is 0.8 * $40,000 = $32,000. Considering the price you're offering is $10,000, I believe it's a good deal and I'd like to buy the product.""
