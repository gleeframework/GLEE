``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No prior data:**  The lack of previous sales information means we have no basis to assess the seller's recommendation.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the value of the product to us, recommends buying. This suggests the product might be high quality, as she would want to maximize her profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the probability of a low-quality product is higher, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant. This makes it a reasonable gamble, especially with no other information to go on."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. Only one sale has occurred, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough data to draw any statistically significant conclusions.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of their quality. This means her recommendation isn't necessarily reliable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While the product has a higher chance of being low-quality, a high-quality product provides a significant profit. 

**Strategy:**  Since we have no concrete data to go on, taking a calculated risk is the best option."
