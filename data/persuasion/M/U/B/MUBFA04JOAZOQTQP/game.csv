,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will take it, and I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
