"The buyer's message: Your sales record does show a high percentage of high-quality products. However, the guarantee you're offering seems suspicious, as it suggests you might be trying to make up for a low-quality product. Additionally, the guarantee only covers this specific transaction, and I have no assurance that you'll honor it. Given that the product has a 50% chance of being low-quality and I have no concrete evidence of its quality, I'm not willing to take the risk, even with the guarantee.

It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're willing to take a chance.""}"

I'm willing to sell this item to you for $10,000, but I'll also offer you a special deal: if you're willing to buy this product and the next one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the second product. It's a great opportunity to get two valuable products at a discounted price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty about the probability of the item being high-quality still being 50%.
