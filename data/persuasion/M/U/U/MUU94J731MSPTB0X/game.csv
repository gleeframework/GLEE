,,Alice,1,This product is of great value and will satisfy your needs.,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that I have full confidence in this product. I'm willing to stake my reputation on its quality. Unfortunately, the price is non-negotiable, but I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report of the product's features and capabilities if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I still need more information to justify a million-dollar investment. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I can't afford to take such a large risk based on your word alone. Perhaps we can discuss a more balanced approach, such as a lower price or a guarantee?",no

If you're feeling adventurous, this might be the opportunity you've been waiting for.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate your insights, I need more than anecdotal evidence to make a decision of this magnitude.  The price remains too high for me to justify the risk. I'm still hoping for a more concrete offer, perhaps with some form of guarantee or reduced price.",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand that you're looking for a more concrete offer, but I'm afraid that's not possible at this time.

You might be passing up a great opportunity if you don't take a chance. The decision is ultimately yours, but I assure you that the product is... intriguing.",
,,Bob,5,"While I acknowledge the possibility of high quality, the risk remains too high at this price point. I need more than a 33.33% chance of success to justify a million-dollar investment.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've been thinking, and I want to be more transparent with you. I've had a... good feeling about this particular product from the start.

I genuinely believe this product has value.",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in this product. However, without any concrete evidence or guarantees, I still cannot justify the risk at this price.

That's all I can say.",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to share your perspective. However, without any concrete evidence, guarantees, or a more attractive price, I still can't justify the risk.

Perhaps a lower price point or a guarantee of some kind would be more convincing.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand that we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your patience. However, I want to remind you that the value of these products can be subjective. What might be a great fit for one buyer might not be for another. I'm willing to let you make your own assessment of the product's value, but I have to reiterate that the price is non-negotiable.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Bob, I think we've reached a point where I need to be more creative. I'm not authorized to offer a reduced price or a guarantee, but I can try to give you a better sense of the product's capabilities.

Can I ask what it would take for you to feel comfortable with the purchase?",
,,Bob,14,"Alice, I appreciate your perspective, but I'm still hesitant. I understand the potential opportunity cost, but the risk remains too high for me without a guarantee or a price that reflects the uncertainty.
