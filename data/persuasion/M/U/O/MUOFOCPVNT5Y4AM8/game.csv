,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the previous two buyers, and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, so it's a neutral indicator for me."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
