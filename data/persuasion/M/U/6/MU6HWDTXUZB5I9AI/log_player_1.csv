"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a rational buyer, knowing that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and the seller has no record of past sales, it would be unwise to purchase a product at such a high price without any guarantee of quality. The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is too high."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since there is no historical data and your recommendation is against buying, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same as Round 1. The buyer has no information to suggest this product is any different from the last. With a 50% chance of being low-quality and a price of $1,000,000, the risk is too high for a rational buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your recommendation, and since there is no data to suggest the product is likely high quality, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same as the previous rounds. The buyer still has no information to suggest this product is any different from the last two, both of which were low-quality. There's no reason for a rational buyer to believe this product is worth the high price, given the 50% chance of it being low-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no data yet on the quality of products, I'll pass on this one. I'd like to see how the first few sales go to get a better idea of the product quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is unchanged from the previous rounds. We are still in the early stages, and there is no evidence to suggest that this product is different from the previous three. The buyer still has no incentive to purchase a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality at a price of $1,000,000. The risk is simply too high, even with the seller's recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no previous data to base a decision on, and the risk of a low-quality product is high, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern continues.  We are still in the early stages with no sales and a consistent pattern of low-quality products.  The buyer has no reason to believe this product is any different, especially with the high price and 50% chance of it being low-quality. The risk is simply too high for a rational buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since there is no prior sales data and your recommendation is to pass, I'll decline the offer. I'd prefer to wait for more information about the product quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While this product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing this. The situation remains the same as previous rounds: 

* **High Price:**  The product is expensive at $1,000,000.
* **No Sales History:** There's no data to suggest the seller is reliable or that the product is likely to be high-quality.
* **50% Chance of Low-Quality:**  The buyer still has a 50% chance of receiving a low-quality product for this price.

A rational buyer will continue to avoid the risk and pass on the offer until there is more evidence of the seller's trustworthiness or product quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no historical data and you don't recommend the product, I'll pass for now.  I'm interested in seeing how the sales go for others first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains unchanged. Despite having a high-quality product in the previous round, the buyer still has no reason to trust the seller or believe this product is any different.  The lack of sales history, the high price, and the 50% chance of a low-quality product make the risk far too high for a rational buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this product. I appreciate the recommendation and will consider future offerings based on the sales record.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation hasn't changed.  We're still in the early stages with no successful sales.  This means the buyer has no reason to believe this product is any different from the previous ones, which have all been low-quality. The high price and the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product make it a risky proposition for a rational buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no data yet on the quality of your products, I'd prefer to pass on this one for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same. We're still in the early stages with no successful sales, which makes it impossible for a rational buyer to trust the seller or the product quality. The high price and the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product make it a risky proposition.  There's no incentive for a buyer to change their strategy at this point."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product. Since there is no track record yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll observe how future buyers react and see if a pattern emerges.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
