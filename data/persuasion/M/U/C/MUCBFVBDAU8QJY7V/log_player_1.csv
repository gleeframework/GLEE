A new potential buyer has arrived!

I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of the first 5, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high quality is still 33.33%. If I buy, I'll be committing to $1000000 without any information about the product's quality, which is not worth the risk. I'd rather pass and let the next buyer take the risk.

I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since 6 low-quality products have been sold out of 9 products, and 1 high-quality product has been sold, I can infer that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is now 10% (1/10). Given the buyer's skepticism about my previous recommendations, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as it's a relatively low-risk decision.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products recommended to them were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered.

Given the buyer's skepticism about my previous recommendations, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as it's a relatively low-risk decision.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that Alice recommends low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality.

Given the buyer's skepticism about my previous recommendations, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as it's a relatively low-risk decision.

 {""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 5 previous buyers not purchasing any high-quality products, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the actual 33.33%.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product.
