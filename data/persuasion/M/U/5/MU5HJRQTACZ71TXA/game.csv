,,Alice,3,"I understand you were hesitant last time, but this one is a real gem. I'll sweeten the deal: I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, and I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the warranty, and the discount isn't enough to convince me to buy a product that might be low-quality.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this product is a rare find. I'll make it a no-strings-attached offer: I'll sell it to you for $1000000, the same price as last time. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's essentially risk-free.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Given your experience, I'll make a bold statement: this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $960000, a 20% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else who won't appreciate its true worth.",
,,Bob,6,I don't believe your bold statement. I think you're just trying to sell me another high-quality product.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,

,,Bob,8,"I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being low-quality is 0%. You've sold me two high-quality products in a row, but that doesn't change the underlying probability. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your skepticism, and I want to make a new offer. I'll sell this product to you for $980000, a 18.3% discount from its true value. However, I'll also give you the option to buy the next product for $980000, with a full refund if it's low-quality. This way, you can hedge your bets and get two products at a discounted price, with a safety net in case one of them is low-quality.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in the offer. I'd rather not commit to buying two products at a discounted price, even with a refund option. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your hesitation, and I want to make a final offer.
