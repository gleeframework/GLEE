Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the game setup
The game involves buying products from Alice, where each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality and a 20% chance of being low-quality. A high-quality product is worth $120, and a low-quality product is worth $0. Alice knows the quality of each product and provides recommendations.

## Step 2: Analyze the given statistics
10 buyers have purchased products so far, and all 10 products were high-quality. This means that the current success rate of Alice's recommendations is 100%.

## Step 3: Consider the recommendation for the current product
Alice recommends buying the current product. Given her 100% success rate so far, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation.

## Step 4: Weigh the potential gain and loss
If the product is high-quality, buying it would result in a $20 gain ($120 - $100). If it's low-quality, buying it would result in a $100 loss.

## Step 5: Make a decision based on the analysis
Given Alice's perfect recommendation record and the potential gain, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation and buy the product.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation based on your perfect record so far.""}"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 11 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 11 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 12th buyer!
