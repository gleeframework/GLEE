high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 3 failed high-quality product sales, I suspect that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or consider other factors before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, she has recommended 0 high-quality products out of 4 sales. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping the product is high-quality."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 5 previous buyers who bought, none of them received a high-quality product.

I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
