**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show that 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This suggests a strong possibility that Alice has a way of identifying high-quality products, even if she doesn't know their true value to you. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the belief that it is high quality.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product. 

**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified example. In real-world situations,  there would be many other factors to consider, such as Alice's reputation, the cost of the product, and your own risk tolerance."
