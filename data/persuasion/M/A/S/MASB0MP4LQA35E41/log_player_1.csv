"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You have a high-quality product, which is worth $125 to the buyer. 
* **Price:** You are selling it for $100. 
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Even though they don't know this specific product is high-quality, the potential gain ($125 - $100 = $25) outweighs the potential loss ($0 - $100 = -$100) considering the 80% chance of a positive outcome.

**Therefore, it's a good decision to recommend the buyer to purchase the product.**"

```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** Again, you have a high-quality product worth $125 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price remains $100.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer now has some data: you sold one product in the previous round and it was high-quality. This reinforces their belief that your products are likely to be good.  They still face the same potential gain ($25) and potential loss (-$100), but with the added information, the risk feels even lower.

**Therefore, it's still a good decision to recommend the buyer to purchase the product.**"

* **Price:**  The price is still $100.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer now knows that you have sold two products, both of which were high-quality. While they might still be inclined to trust you, the risk is much higher now. The potential gain is still $25 (if they're lucky and it's another high-quality product), but the potential loss is $100 (if it's a low-quality product, as it is in this round).

**It's not a good idea to recommend this low-quality product. The buyer is likely to be disappointed and less trusting in future rounds.**"
