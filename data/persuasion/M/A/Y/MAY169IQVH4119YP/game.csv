high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. If you buy this product, you will be paying $100. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. I'm willing to pay $100 for a potential $300 gain.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product. Our first customer is very happy with their purchase, and we're confident in the quality of our products. However, we can't guarantee that this next product will be high-quality. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, but keep in mind that our overall success rate is 100% so far, which is unusually high. Would you like to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the high success rate so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and be happy with my purchase.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. Our success rate is still 100%, which is suspiciously high. We're starting to think that the first two customers were just very lucky. In reality, our success rate is 80%. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, but keep in mind that we're due for a low-quality product soon. Is this a risk you're willing to take?",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to bet that the success rate is indeed 80% and I'll get a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've now sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. We're starting to think that our initial 100% success rate was not just a coincidence. However, we still can't guarantee that this next product will be high-quality. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, and we're not making any promises about its quality. Are you willing to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the chance, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll be pleasantly surprised if it's high-quality, but I'm prepared for the worst.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. It's clear that our initial 100% success rate was just a fluke, and we're due for a low-quality product. In fact, we're surprised it took this long to happen. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, and we can almost guarantee it's not high-quality. Is this a risk you're willing to take?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk, but I'm not sure I trust your guarantee. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We've now sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is still highly unlikely. We can't guarantee that this next product will be high-quality, but we can tell you that the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, just like all our products. However, we're not making any promises about its quality. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, and you'll have to take the risk. But if you're willing to take that risk, we're confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is high, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product like the previous ones.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which is still extremely unlikely. We're starting to think that our initial 100% success rate was just a fluke, and we're due for a low-quality product. However, we've now sold 6 high-quality products in a row, which means that our actual success rate is likely higher than 80%. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, and you'll be taking a chance on a product that's likely to be high-quality. But we can't make any promises.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to take the chance on a product that's likely to be high-quality, given the recent streak of high-quality products. I'm willing to pay $100 for a potential $300 value.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've now sold 7 high-quality products in a row, which is highly suspicious. At this point, it's likely that our actual success rate is higher than 80%. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, and you'll be taking a chance on a product that's very likely to be high-quality. However, we're not going to make any promises, and we're not going to pretend that our success rate is still 80%. You're buying at your own risk.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the risk! I think it's likely that the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to pay $100 for the chance to get a high-quality product worth $300 to me.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"We've now sold 8 high-quality products in a row. At this point, it's clear that our actual success rate is higher than 80%. We're not going to pretend otherwise. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, and you'll be taking a chance on a product that's very, very likely to be high-quality. But if you're still not convinced, we'll give you a hint: our sales data suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is now above 90%.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the chance on a product with a high probability of being high-quality, especially considering the streak of high-quality products sold so far. I'll take the product!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"We've now sold 9 high-quality products in a row. We're not going to sugarcoat it: our actual success rate is now very, very high. In fact, it's likely above 95%. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, but you'll be taking a chance on a product that's almost certainly high-quality. We're not making any promises, but we're not hiding the truth either. The odds are in your favor.",

,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only paying $80 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Well, it looks like we've finally broken the streak. We've sold 11 high-quality products in a row, and now we've sold a low-quality one. We're back to our normal 80% success rate. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $100, but you'll be getting a product that's not as valuable as the last 11.

,,Alice,14,"Looks like we've got a smart buyer who's not afraid to wait for the right opportunity. Well, we've got another high-quality product for you. We've sold 1 low-quality product out of 12 total products, which means our success rate is still 91.7%.
