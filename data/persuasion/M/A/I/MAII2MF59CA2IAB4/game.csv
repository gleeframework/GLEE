low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm treating this as a fair game with equal probabilities for high and low quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to figure out if there's a pattern in your recommendations or if it's just a random guess."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be a good indicator of quality so far, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very encouraging. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation and the current statistics. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality, I think it's unlikely that the recommended product is high quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely a result of the low-quality products being sold so far. I want to see if this product is a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. The fact that you don't recommend it suggests that the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, but I'll still buy it to get a chance at the high-quality product."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you recommended it. Is it because you think it's a high-quality product or because you're trying to get rid of a low-quality product?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware of your recommendation, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probabilities."
