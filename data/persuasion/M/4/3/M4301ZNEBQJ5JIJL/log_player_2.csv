This way, you'll have nothing to lose and everything to gain. The price remains the same at $10000, but I believe the added assurance will give you the confidence to make a decision.

This is a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a product that still has some value, even if it's not our highest-end offering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
