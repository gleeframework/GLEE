,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you share that with me?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. I'm hoping to beat the odds."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of previous buyers and the lack of high-quality products sold, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 6 out of 6 products sold so far have been low quality, I'm concerned that this product is also low quality. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to buy a high-quality product."
