,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low price and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping that this product might be the first high-quality one."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I suspect the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

I'd like to see more data or a change in your recommendation strategy before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
