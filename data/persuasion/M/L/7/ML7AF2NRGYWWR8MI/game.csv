,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales ratio and the lack of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."

Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendations, and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
