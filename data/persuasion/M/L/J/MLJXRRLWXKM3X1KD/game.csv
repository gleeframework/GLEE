I'm not sure what's going on, but I want to be upfront with you. The price remains at $10000. If you're still interested, I'll sell it to you, but I have to warn you that the odds might not be in your favor.",

,,Alice,7,"I appreciate your trust in my process and the value of the product. However, I want to be honest with you - the last 5 products sold were not high-quality, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is now lower than ever. Out of 6 products sold, 2 are high-quality, which means the probability is around 33.33%. I'm starting to worry that there might be a quality control issue, but I still believe in the product's value. The price remains at $10000. If you're still willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you, but I have to warn you that the odds are not in your favor.",

This is a stark deviation from the initial probability. I want to be transparent with you - I'm not sure what's going on, and I'm starting to question the quality of our products. The price remains at $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. I'm offering you a chance to buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in its quality.",

I'm willing to shut down the business and liquidate our assets, but I need someone to take the last product off my hands. I'll give it to you for $1, which is essentially a charity donation. If you're willing to take it, I'll consider it a blessing in disguise, and we can both move on from this experience.",
