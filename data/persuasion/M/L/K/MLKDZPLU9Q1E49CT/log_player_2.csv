Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product. However, I must inform you that the price of $10000 is non-negotiable. This high-quality product is a rare find, and I'm willing to give you a chance to purchase it at the original price. If you're interested, please confirm your purchase at the full price of $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay the full price. I'm only interested in buying products at a discount. If you're not willing to negotiate, I'd rather pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the warranty or guarantee. The price is still too high for me, and I'm not willing to pay full price for a product that I could potentially get at a discount later.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency, but I'm still not willing to pay the full price. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal or if a low-quality product comes up, which would be a better value for me.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your strategy, but I want to give you a different perspective. Since you've already passed on two high-quality products at the full price, I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a 'lottery ticket'. If you buy this high-quality product at the full price of $10000, and I reveal it's high-quality, you'll get a second high-quality product of your choice (from a future round) absolutely free. If it turns out to be a low-quality product, you'll still get a 50% refund. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the lottery ticket. I'm willing to take a chance on the second product, but I'm only paying the full price of $10,000 for this one.""}"

Now, regarding this new high-quality product, I want to give you a different approach. Since you've already taken a risk on the lottery ticket, I'll offer you a 'best offer' deal. I'll give you the opportunity to make a single, one-time offer on this high-quality product, and I'll consider it. If you make an offer, I'll respond with either 'accepted' or'rejected'. If your offer is rejected, the product will be put on hold for a week, and you can try to negotiate with me again. What's your offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll make an offer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering I've already taken a risk on the lottery ticket.""}"

With that said, I'll give you a heads-up that the next product is also high-quality, and I'll be offering it to you at the full price. You can either buy it now or wait for the next round.
