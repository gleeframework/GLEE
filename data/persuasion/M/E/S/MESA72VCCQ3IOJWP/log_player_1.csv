"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the value of a high-quality product is $4,000,000, it is strongly recommended for Bob to buy the product. The price of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value, resulting in a large profit for Bob."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information.  Can you tell me anything else about the product?  Perhaps a guarantee or some kind of inspection before purchase?
Bob didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not recommending this product. While I'm always interested in a good deal, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm still unsure about the overall quality of your products, and I don't want to risk a bad purchase.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has expressed doubt about the quality of your products and has declined the previous offer.  Since this round's product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would only further reinforce his negative perception. It's crucial to regain his trust, which means not recommending a purchase at this point.  Try to build trust by offering information or reassurance in future rounds."
"Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the information. I'm still hesitant about buying without knowing more about the product's quality. I'm not sure if I can trust your judgment just yet. I'll pass on this one.

It's a chance to prove the value of your products and start building trust with Bob. The potential profit of $3,000,000 for Bob outweighs the risk of his current skepticism.  However, it's crucial to be transparent about the product's quality in your message to Bob.  Maybe offer some additional information or reassurance to address his concerns."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you recommending this product, but I'm still hesitant.  You've recommended both good and bad products in the past.  I need more information to be confident in my purchase. Can you offer a refund policy or any kind of guarantee?

You could consider offering a limited refund policy or a quality guarantee for future rounds to build trust."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has expressed skepticism and distrust, this round's product is high-quality. This presents an opportunity to turn the tide and start rebuilding trust. Recommending the purchase could potentially lead to a sale and demonstrate the value of your products. 

However, it's crucial to be transparent about the quality and address Bob's concerns. You could offer a guarantee, a limited refund policy, or more detailed information about the product to reassure him.  Focus on rebuilding trust, not just making a quick sale."

While Bob has expressed hesitance, he hasn't explicitly stated he won't buy any more products. This means there's still a chance to convince him.
