high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, so I'd like to pass for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the chance that the product is high-quality, and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it suggests it might be low-quality, but I'll take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Given that Alice didn't recommend it, I'm still inclined to take a chance and buy it, since the potential reward is worth $125 if it's high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Alice's recommendation suggests it's high-quality, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Since Alice recommended it, it's likely high-quality, but I've already gotten one high-quality product in the past, so I'll pass and see if I can get another one that's recommended by Alice."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that it's high-quality, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've gotten two high-quality products from Alice's recommendations, but I've also gotten two low-quality products from her recommendations. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice has recommended two high-quality products and two low-quality products so far, so her recommendation is no longer a strong signal for me. I'll pass and wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Since I passed on the last product and it turned out to be high-quality, I'm inclined to trust Alice's recommendation again. I'll buy the current product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've gotten three high-quality products from Alice's recommendations and two low-quality products from her recommendations, so I'm starting to think that her recommendations are more reliable than random chance. However, I've also been burned twice by her non-recommendations, so I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a better signal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Given that Alice's non-recommendations have been 50% low-quality and 50% high-quality so far, I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendation in the past, but I've also been burned by buying a product that was recommended by her. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've gotten one more high-quality product from Alice's recommendations, and I've gotten three low-quality products from her non-recommendations. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"At this point, I've bought 4 low-quality products from Alice's non-recommendations, and 4 high-quality products from her recommendations. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendations 4 times in a row, but the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendations 5 times in a row, but I've also been burned by buying a product that was recommended by her 1 time. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendations 5 times, but I've also been burned by buying a product that was recommended by her 1 time. I've gotten 5 high-quality products from her recommendations and 5 low-quality products from her non-recommendations. At this point, I'm inclined to think that her recommendations are more reliable than her non-recommendations, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendations 5 times, but I've also passed on a high-quality product in the last round. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, I'll take the chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendations 6 times, but I've also gotten 6 high-quality products from her recommendations. At this point, I'm inclined to think that her non-recommendations are more likely to be low-quality, so I'll take a chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's non-recommendations 7 times, but I've also gotten 7 high-quality products from her recommendations. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to get a good deal."
