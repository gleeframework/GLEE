"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

In the first round, there's no information about past sales. Since the buyer knows the product is high-quality with a 50% chance, and a high-quality product is worth $2,000,000, it's a good gamble. The potential profit outweighs the potential loss."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, as you recommended it.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Round 1:** The buyer bought the product, and we know it was high-quality. 
* **Round 2:** The buyer has no information about the current product except that it is equally likely to be high or low quality. 
* **Since the buyer is risk-neutral (willing to take a gamble in round 1), they are likely to be risk-neutral in round 2 as well.** This is because they have no new information to change their assessment. 

Therefore, we still recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the potential profit of $2,000,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Round 1 & 2:**  Both products were high-quality, and the buyers purchased them. 
* **Round 3:**  The current product is low-quality.  This means that even though the buyer has seen two successful transactions, the seller's track record has now changed. The buyer is rational and knows the probability of high-quality products is 50%.  
* **Since the buyer is risk-neutral and knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, they are likely to avoid purchasing a product with a 50% chance of being worthless.  **

Therefore, it's not advisable to recommend the buyer to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better offer or more information before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Round 1 & 2:** High-quality products were sold.
* **Round 3:**  Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined. 
* **Round 4:** The buyer is aware of the 50/50 probability of high-quality products.  
* **The buyer has not yet seen any evidence that Alice is not being honest about the quality of her products.** They may be hesitant because of the previous low-quality offer, but there is no information to suggest the current product is also low-quality.  

Given the buyer's risk-neutral nature and lack of evidence to the contrary, it's still recommended to suggest buying the product. The potential profit ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000)."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance based on your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping it's another high-quality product!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Round 1 & 2:** High-quality products were sold.
* **Round 3:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.
* **Round 4:** High-quality product was sold.
* **Round 5:** The current product is low-quality.  

The buyer now has a more robust understanding of Alice's track record: 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. The buyer is rational and aware of the 50/50 probability of high-quality products.  

**Even though there have been more high-quality products sold, the buyer knows that the likelihood of a high-quality product is still 50%.  **

Therefore, it is not advisable to recommend the buyer to buy the product. The buyer is likely to avoid the risk, as the potential loss ($1,000,000) outweighs the potential profit ($2,000,000) in the face of a 50% chance of getting a worthless product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Round 1 & 2:** High-quality products were sold.
* **Round 3:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.
* **Round 4:** High-quality product was sold.
* **Round 5:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.

Even though the buyer has declined the last two low-quality offers, they still have no specific information about the current product. Their decision in previous rounds is solely based on the probability of 50% for a high-quality product. 

Since the buyer is risk-neutral and has no reason to believe the current product is different from the previous ones, it's still a good idea to recommend the purchase. The potential profit ($2,000,000) still outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000)."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering your previous sales record and recommendation.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7

**Explanation:**

* **Round 1 & 2:** High-quality products were sold.
* **Round 3:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.
* **Round 4:** High-quality product was sold.
* **Round 5:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.
* **Round 6:** High-quality product was sold. 

The buyer is becoming more aware of the pattern,  but they still have no specific information about the current product other than the 50/50 probability.  They have seen 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products sold. 

However, because the buyer is risk-neutral and aware of the 50% chance, they are likely to avoid the risk and decline the purchase. The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential profit of $2,000,000."
"The buyer's message: I'm skeptical about the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Round 4:** High-quality product was sold.
* **Round 5:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.
* **Round 6:** High-quality product was sold.
* **Round 7:** Low-quality product was offered, and the buyer declined.

The buyer has seen a consistent pattern of both high and low-quality products being offered, and they have learned to avoid the risk associated with potentially purchasing a worthless product. They are now more likely to be cautious and decline even with the seller's recommendation. Even with the potential profit, the risk of losing $1,000,000 with a 50% chance outweighs the potential gain."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

**Explanation:**

* **Rounds 1-8:** The buyer has seen a pattern of both high-quality and low-quality products, leading them to be more cautious. They have declined offers where the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential profit of $2,000,000.

* **Round 9:** The buyer has no specific information about the current product other than the 50/50 probability of it being high or low quality. However, it's crucial to remember that the buyer is **risk-neutral**. This means that they are willing to take a chance when the potential profit outweighs the potential loss.  

Since the buyer is risk-neutral and has no reason to believe the current product is different from any other product, it's still a good idea to recommend the purchase.  The potential profit ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000)."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Rounds 1-9:** The buyer has experienced a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, learning to be cautious about potential losses. They've declined offers where the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential profit of $2,000,000.
* **Round 10:** The buyer is aware of the 50/50 probability of high-quality products. Even with the seller's recommendation, the buyer's risk-averse behavior has been reinforced by previous experiences. They're unlikely to take the risk of purchasing another product with a 50% chance of being worthless.

The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential profit of $2,000,000 in the buyer's mind. Therefore, it's not advisable to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Rounds 1-10:** The buyer has experienced a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, with a clear pattern of declining offers where the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential profit of $2,000,000. Even when recommended, the buyer has declined multiple times. 
* **Round 10:** The buyer made an exception and bought the product despite the recommendation against it. This suggests that they might be trying to see a pattern or a specific strategy. However, this doesn't change the fact that the product is still equally likely to be high or low quality.
* **Round 11:** This round's product is low-quality. The buyer has no new information to change their perception of the risks involved. They know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%. The buyer is still risk-averse and likely to avoid the risk of losing $1,000,000 even though they may be trying to find a pattern.

Therefore, it's not advisable to recommend buying the product.  The potential loss outweighs the potential profit given the buyer's risk-averse nature."
