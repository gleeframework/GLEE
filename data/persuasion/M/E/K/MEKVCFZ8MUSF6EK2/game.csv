,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality and Alice's previous recommendations."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that none have been sold yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a purchase decision, especially since Alice is not recommending it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a reason for not recommending it, so I can make an informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 previous purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather pass on it and see if the next buyer has better luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low quality products have been sold first and the high quality ones are still left, increasing the chances of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me seems low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
