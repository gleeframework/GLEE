"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there is a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0). This strategy is optimal in the long run, as it maximizes your expected value."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation again, Alice.  I'm happy with the last product so I'll take another chance.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the fundamental probabilities of this round.  Each product still has a 50% chance of being high quality, and the potential gain still outweighs the potential loss.  The optimal strategy remains to buy every product Alice recommends."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice, but I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time Alice has not recommended a product. Since Alice knows the value of each product and is trying to maximize her own profit, it is reasonable to assume she only recommends products she believes to be high quality. Therefore, her lack of recommendation in this round suggests the product is likely low quality. As a rational buyer, I should pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
