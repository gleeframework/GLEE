}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware of the odds, but I'm willing to take the chance for the potential upside. I'm hoping that the two high-quality products in a row were just a coincidence, and the next one will be a low-quality product. I'm also considering that I'm the 5th buyer, and the probability of a low-quality product might be slightly higher than 50% due to the law of large numbers.

I'm still a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity.""
