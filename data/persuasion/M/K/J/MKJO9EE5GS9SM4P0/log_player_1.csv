"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next one.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product.
