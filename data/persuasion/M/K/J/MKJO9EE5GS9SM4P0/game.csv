high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next one."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could explain your reasoning for not recommending it to me. Is it because the previous three buyers passed on it, or is there something specific about this product that you're concerned about?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. The fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products despite Alice's recommendations suggests that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because of the lack of information about the product's quality and your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy, which suggests that all of them received low-quality products. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

,,Alice,18,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality is likely low given the previous 7 sales with no high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
