"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you like the product! However, I must inform you that the price of $50 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a one-time price of $75 for this high-quality product. It's a fair price, considering the quality and value it brings.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to pay $75 for this product. I think it's still overpriced. I'd like to pass on this one.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still not acceptable to you. I'll try to be more flexible.
