**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in our favor:** Although the overall odds of getting a high-quality product are 33.33%, the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product significantly shifts the probability in our favor. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation to buy strengthens the argument for purchasing. 
* **Potential for profit:**  Even if the product is low quality, we lose nothing but the $10,000. However, if it's high quality, we stand to make a $2,500 profit.

**It's a calculated risk, but with the available information, buying seems like the best option.**"
