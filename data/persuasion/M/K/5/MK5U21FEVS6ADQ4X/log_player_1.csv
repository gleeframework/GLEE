Out of 2 buyers who passed on products, 0 were high-quality. This suggests that the 2 buyers who passed on products may have been trying to 'time' the market, waiting for a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $950,000, and I'll throw in an additional 10% discount if you're willing to buy it now. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.""}"

With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3 total products offered, and 2 buyers who passed on products (both of which were high-quality), I estimate that the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 100%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, a 25% discount from its true value. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.""}"

I'm taking on some risk by offering this discount, so I'm willing to sweeten the deal: if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a $50,000 refund.

However, I'll also offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price, plus an additional $200,000.

This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the true probability of a high-quality product.""}"

However, I'll also offer you a'streak-breaker' deal: if you buy this product and the next 2 products are low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price, plus an additional $400,000. This way, you'll have a chance to break the streak and get a good deal.""}"
