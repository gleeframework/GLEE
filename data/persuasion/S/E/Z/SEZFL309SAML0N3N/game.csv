low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on my own assessment of the probability of the product being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'm not sure if the previous buyers were informed or if they had access to the same information as I do. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on the product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I have no information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not in my favor and the sales record suggests a higher proportion of low-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I can trust your recommendations, since they seem to be based on the product's quality, but I don't have any information about the quality of the products you recommended to the previous buyers. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as it's a one-time opportunity, and I might get a high-quality product for a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance because the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality, making my expected value higher than $0. However, I'm aware that this is a risk, and I might end up with a $0 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. This might be a low-quality product, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products were sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice is not recommending to buy, as that would indicate a higher likelihood of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 10 out of 10 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low quality products are overrepresented in the previous sales, making this one more likely to be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products being sold. Can you tell me more about your sales record and how you select the products?"
