low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We have sold 0 high-quality products so far. If you buy it, you will pay $1000000. If you don't buy it, you will walk away with nothing. It's a one-time offer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. We've sold 0 high-quality products. If you buy this one, you'll be our second product, and we're 0 for 2. If you don't buy, we'll keep trying. You'll pay $1000000 either way. Are you willing to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,2,I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We're 0 for 2 so far. We've sold 2 low-quality products. If you buy this one, you'll be our third product, and we're 0 for 3. We're starting to look like a bad investment. But hey, you might get lucky and get a good deal! You'll pay $1000000 either way. Want to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,3,I'm willing to take the risk for the potential high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We're 0 for 3. Two out of three products were low-quality. At this point, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is less than 50%. If you buy this one, you'll be our fourth product, and we're 0 for 4. You'll pay $1000000 either way. Are you really sure you want to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and the risk involved, I choose not to purchase the current product. I appreciate your transparency.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've had a streak of bad luck so far, but we've finally got a high-quality product! We're 0 for 4, but that means the next one you buy has a 50% chance of being high-quality. We're willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,Thank you for the opportunity. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We've sold one high-quality product, and now we've got another one! That's 1 out of 5 products sold, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is at least 20%. We're 1 for 5, but we're on a roll! This one is also available for $1000000. Want to join the winning streak?",
,,the buyer,6,I believe in the winning streak. Let's make it happen!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've had two high-quality products in a row, but it looks like the streak has ended. We're 2 for 5, but 2 out of the last 2 products were low-quality. This makes us 2 for 7 overall, and the probability of a product being high-quality is likely lower than 20%. We're 2 for 7, and the law of averages is against us. You might want to think twice before buying this one for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the recent statistics and the risk involved, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've sold 2 high-quality products, but the rest have been low-quality. That's 2 out of 8, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is likely around 25%. We're 2 for 8, and it's starting to look like we're not as lucky as we thought. This one is available for $1000000. Are you willing to take the risk and try your luck?",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and the risk involved, I am willing to take a chance and purchase the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"We're still 2 for 8, and the last 4 products were low-quality. That means the probability of a product being high-quality is likely around 20% or less. We're starting to look like a bad investment. If you buy this one, you'll be our 9th product, and we'll be 2 for 9. You'll pay $1000000 either way. Are you really sure you want to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Despite the risks, I believe in taking calculated chances. I trust your process and am willing to invest in the hope of receiving a high-quality product. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"We've sold 2 high-quality products, but the rest have been low-quality. That's 2 out of 9, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is likely around 22%. We're 2 for 9, and it's clear that we're not as good at selling high-quality products as we thought. If you buy this one, you'll be our 10th product, and we'll be 2 for 10.

We're 3 for 10, and it looks like we're finally getting the hang of this. This one is available for $1000000. We think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.

We're 3 for 11, and it's clear that we're still not consistent. If you buy this one, you'll be our 12th product, and we'll be 3 for 12. You'll pay $1000000 either way. We're not getting any better at this. Want to take the risk?",

We're 5 for 14, and it's clear that we're still not consistent. If you buy this one, you'll be our 15th product, and we'll be 5 for 15. We're not getting any better at this.
