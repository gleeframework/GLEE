high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice has recommended 2 products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given Alice's recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a pattern or reason behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be low. I'd rather wait for the next product or consider the odds of the next product being high-quality based on the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This is consistent with a 50% chance of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the current sales record. I'd appreciate it if you could share that with me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely low-quality.
