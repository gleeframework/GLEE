**Explanation:**

* **High Sales Rate:** The fact that 3 out of 3 products sold were high quality suggests a very strong pattern.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's still a chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $300 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 100% of the products recommended by Alice have been high quality. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator. Since she knows the value of each product, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) far outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information provided and the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith. In reality, there could be other factors at play."
