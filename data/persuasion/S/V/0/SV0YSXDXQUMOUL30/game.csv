,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and it's a high-quality one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $1000000 when I know its true value is $1200000. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come up, if any.",no

,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product for $900000. I'm not sure why you're selling it for so cheap, but I'm happy to take advantage of the deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You got a great deal on the last one, didn't you? I'm glad you're happy. As for this one, I'll be honest with you, it's another low-quality product. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000. I know it's a big drop from the last one, but I'm trying to clear out my inventory. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",

I'll sell it to you for $0, but only if you agree to take it right now. I don't want to have to look at it anymore, and I'll even throw in a free gift: a nice, shiny rock. You can have it for free, just take the low-quality product off my hands.",
