``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We have very limited data: only one previous sale with a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a positive sign, as she knows the product's quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $125 high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product.

**In essence, the recommendation from Alice combined with the limited information available makes buying the product the better option in this scenario.**"

```

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that 100% of the products sold so far were high-quality. This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are very reliable. 
* **Value Proposition:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $125 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality one.

**Reasoning:**

Given the overwhelming evidence of Alice's success in identifying high-quality products, it's a good gamble to trust her recommendation and buy the product."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 4 out of 4 products sold being high quality, the seller has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that the product Alice is currently recommending is also likely to be high quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  A high-quality product is worth $125 to you, while the cost is only $100. This means a potential profit of $25.
* **Low Risk:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality (a 20% chance), you only lose $100. This is a relatively low risk compared to the potential $25 gain.

**Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product based on the available information.**"
