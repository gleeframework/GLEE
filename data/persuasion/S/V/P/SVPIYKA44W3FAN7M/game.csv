low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than the initial 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and I'd like to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the products offered so far were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know if there's any pattern or strategy you can share with me before I make my decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product, hoping that it might be a low-quality one. If I pass, it will be discarded and I won't lose anything. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose $1000000. If I buy it and it's high quality, I'll lose $1000000 and the product's value of $4000000 won't be realized."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm skeptical of your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers also bought the products despite your recommendation and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's unlikely to be high-quality given that none of the previous two products were high-quality.

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that no high-quality products were sold so far suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data or information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I would like to pass on the product, as I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
