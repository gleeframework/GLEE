,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I don't have any information to go on yet, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. The probability of it being low-quality is still quite high. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I'm a risk-taker and willing to take a chance."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide me with the results of the previous sales, including the quality of the products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, how many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer has better luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. If it were high quality, I'd expect at least one buyer to have purchased it by now, given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, and I'd also like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products in the previous 5 sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I don't think your recommendation is based on any information about my valuation of the product, and the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality given that you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. This suggests to me that you've seen a higher proportion of low-quality products than I would have expected, so I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on previous buyers' purchases and I don't have any information to make an informed decision. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
