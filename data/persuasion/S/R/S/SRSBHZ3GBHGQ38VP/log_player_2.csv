Alice's message: Welcome to my collection! I've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. However, I'm glad to report that this one is high-quality! The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. Keep in mind that I've already sold one product, and it was low-quality, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%.
