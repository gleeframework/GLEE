low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended 4 other people to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'm hoping that the product might be high-quality and I'll get the $1200000 value, but I'm also aware that the probability is against me. I'm doing this mostly out of desperation and hoping for a lucky break."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 products were recommended and none were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I'll get a good deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product. I'm assuming that the fact that you're not recommending it to me means that the previous 11 buyers were all given low-quality products, which would mean that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping that it's the first high-quality product in the batch."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 12 failed attempts and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
