low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to see more data before making a decision. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far makes me skeptical about the proportion of high-quality products in the pool. I'd like to wait for more information before committing to a purchase.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm going to buy it anyway because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to let it go to waste."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's recommendation and the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products, it suggests that the products they received were low-quality. I'll wait for a different recommendation or a better opportunity."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a bias towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which is a 0% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, it seems unlikely that the product is high quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
