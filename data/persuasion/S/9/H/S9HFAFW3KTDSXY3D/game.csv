high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,

But I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you the 'buy-back' guarantee again. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to take advantage of the 'buy-back' guarantee and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the high probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.",yes

This is a higher price than the original offer of $50, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, but I want to make sure you feel comfortable with the risk. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate the buy-back guarantee. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to confirm that the price is still $100, and I'll only pay the $75 if it turns out to be low-quality. Can you confirm the details?",yes
