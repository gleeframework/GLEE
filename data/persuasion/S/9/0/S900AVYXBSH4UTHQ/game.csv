high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on considering our exclusive product! With only 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, this is a rare opportunity to get your hands on a top-notch item. We're confident that you'll be thrilled with the performance and value it brings. The price of $1000000 may seem steep, but we assure you that it's a worthwhile investment. Take the chance to elevate your experience and make a statement with this exceptional product. Will you take the plunge and make it yours?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity for now. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being selected as the first one. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'd like to understand the expected value of buying this product. If I buy and it's high-quality, I get $3000000, and if it's low-quality, I get $0. The expected value is (1/3)*3000000 + (2/3)*0 = $1000000. Since the expected value is equal to the price, I'm indifferent to buying or passing. However, I'm not sure if this is the optimal decision given the lack of information about the seller's sales record. I'd like to know the number of potential buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold in the past to make a more informed decision.",no
