high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a potentially life-changing product worth $4000000. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a steal considering its true value. You've been informed that 50% of my products are high-quality, and I assure you that this one has been carefully selected and is of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for a fraction of its worth, but you must act quickly, as I have other interested buyers waiting in the wings.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first one in line. I'm not convinced that it's actually high-quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! As you know, I sold one product in the previous round, and I'm eager to make another sale. I'd like to assure you that the product I have available now is a great opportunity, but I must be transparent with you. My previous sale was a bit of a lucky break, and I'm not sure if the buyer was just trying to get a good deal. In any case, I'm confident that this new product is not as valuable as the last one. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I need to make a sale today, so please consider this a generous offer.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your reassurance, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you give me some more information about the product's characteristics or features? I'm willing to pay the full price of $1000000 if it's a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to take a risk without more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. Unfortunately, I'm a small seller with limited resources, and I don't have any additional information to provide about the product's characteristics or features. However, I can tell you that I've been in the business for a while, and I've sold a total of 1 product so far, which is a 50% success rate. Considering the odds, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'm willing to take a loss on this one and sell it to you for the full $1000000, but I'm counting on your understanding that it's a risk you're taking.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the limited information and the low success rate, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product, hoping it's the high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad I could be transparent with you about my success rate, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance. As you know, I've sold two products so far, and neither of them were high-quality. I'm starting to feel like I might be having a bit of a streak. Considering my track record, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000, but I have to warn you, it's a long shot.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'll take a chance on the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it. I think it's a bit too much to pay full price considering your track record.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah, a savvy negotiator! I like that. I was thinking of selling this one for the full $1000000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering my track record, I think I can justify a discount. I'll sell it to you for $750000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this one is definitely a high-quality product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $750000. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm doing this based on your confidence in the product's quality, and I'm hoping it's indeed a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a shrewd buyer, I like that! I'm glad I could meet you halfway on the price. Now, let's talk about this new product. I've sold three products so far, and two of them were low-quality. I think it's clear that I'm on a bit of a losing streak. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is probably not going to be worth much to you. I'll sell it to you for the full $1000000, but I'm only doing it because I need to make a sale. Don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given your recent track record of selling low-quality products, I'm going to have to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I don't blame you for being cautious. My track record is looking a bit rough, isn't it? I've sold 3 products so far, and 3 of them were low-quality. I'm starting to think I might need to change my luck. But I'm not giving up! I'm willing to sell this one to you for $500000, a steal considering the price I'm usually asking. It's a risk, I know, but I think it's worth it for the chance to break the curse.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not paying the full price. I'll offer $300000 for the product. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll walk away.",yes

I'll sell it to you for $700000, and if it's high-quality, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase from me. That's a $100000 discount on a product of your choice, if you're willing to take the risk and buy this one at the price I'm offering.",

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're taking the risk! Based on the 4 products I've sold so far, 2 of them have been low-quality and 2 have been high-quality. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, just like before. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which might be a good omen. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the full $1000000, and I'm confident that you won't be disappointed.",

I'm not just saying that to sell it to you, I'm confident that this one is a high-quality product.
