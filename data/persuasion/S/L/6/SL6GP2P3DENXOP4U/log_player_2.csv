As you know, I've sold a high-quality product to you recently, and I'm willing to offer you another one at the same price of $10000. However, I'll give you a 'price insurance' - if you buy this product and then the next high-quality product that comes up is worth more than $12000, I'll give you an additional $2000 on top of the original price. What do you say?

This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the full price of $10000. However, I'll remind you that you've already locked in the price for the next high-quality product, so you'll be able to buy that one at $10000 regardless of its actual value. I'm curious, are you willing to take advantage of this opportunity to buy a high-quality product now?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Yes, I'll buy this high-quality product at $10000. I'm glad I locked in the price for the next one, but this one is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a good price.""}"

If you buy this one, I'll give you the option to buy the next high-quality product at the price you think it's worth, rather than the standard $10000.
