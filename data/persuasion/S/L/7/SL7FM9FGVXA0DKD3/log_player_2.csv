"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation is valuable:** Since Alice doesn't know the true value of the product to you, her recommendation carries some weight. It's more likely she would recommend a product she believes to be higher quality.
* **The potential payoff is high:** Even though the odds are against you, the potential payoff of $2,000 if the product is high quality outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 if it's low quality.
* **Early rounds are less risky:**  In the early rounds, you have more rounds to make up for potential losses. 

This approach maximizes your chances of getting a high-quality product while minimizing your risk early in the game."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal:** Alice's recommendation carries weight, and her decision to *not* recommend the product suggests she believes it is likely low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of $2,000 is still there, but the risk is now significantly higher. You've already made a profit on the first round, so there's less pressure to take a gamble.
* **Learning from experience:** You've now seen one high-quality product and can adjust your strategy accordingly.

By passing on this round, you minimize your risk of losing money and keep the potential for profit in future rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate you being upfront, Alice.  I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Consistent Signal:** Alice has now not recommended two products in a row. This reinforces the idea that she likely believes both products were low quality.
* **Risk Aversion:** The risk of losing $10,000 is now even more significant, especially after having already seen one low-quality product.
* **Waiting for Better Opportunities:**  It's more strategic to wait for a round where Alice *does* recommend a product, suggesting a higher chance of it being high quality. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward, aiming to maximize your chances of buying high-quality products while minimizing losses."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
