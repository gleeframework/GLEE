high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You have a 1 in 5 chance of buying a high-quality product from me. This product is the first one I've sold, so I have a 100% success rate so far. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take a chance and buy this product for $100. I'm aware of the 1 in 5 chance of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've arrived just in time! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but I've got a 100% success rate now. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. I know the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but with only one data point, I'm not convinced that Alice's 100% success rate is reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2, which means I'm now at an 50% success rate. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but my success rate is now more representative of the overall quality of my products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?",

Since you're interested in knowing more, I'll give you a brief overview: I've sold 4 products, and 3 of them have been high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and I'm hoping to get lucky, not because I trust your recommendation.",yes

If you're looking for a good deal, I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on your success rate. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad we're on the same page! I'm happy to be transparent about the probability of my products. With 6 high-quality products out of 7, my success rate is now 85.71%. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $100?",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your skepticism! You're right that my success rate is high, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to manipulate the odds.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'll be upfront with you - I've been selling high-quality products consistently, but that's because the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm not trying to deceive you. I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 9, and I'm not going to change the price. If you're willing to take the chance, this product is still available for $100. But if you're not convinced, I completely understand.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'd like to know more about the proportion of low-quality products in the remaining products. With 9 products sold, and 5 of them being high-quality, that means 4 of them were low-quality. Since the total number of products is unknown, I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the remaining products. Can you provide that information?",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 products so far, with 8 of them being high-quality. That means 1 out of the first 9 products was low-quality.

I'm not going to change the price, and I'm still offering you a chance to buy this product for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%. Given the high success rate you've maintained, I'm willing to take the chance. I'm hoping that the 80% probability holds true and I get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're taking a chance! I've sold 14 high-quality products out of a total of 17, which means I've sold 3 low-quality products. Given the number of low-quality products I've sold, it's possible that the true probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 80%. However, I want to be clear that I don't have any information that would suggest the probability is higher than 80%. I'm still offering you a chance to buy this product for $100.
