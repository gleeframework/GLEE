low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and there are no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests the product may be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, as the probability of it being high-quality is low based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you didn't recommend it, and considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This increases the probability that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it. I'm basing this on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests to me that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low, and I'm willing to take a risk and buy it at a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a high-quality product is 0.3333. However, considering the 5 previous buyers passed on the product, the probability of a high-quality product given that they passed is actually lower. I'd like to know the updated probability before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high quality or not, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one as well."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendations, not because I trust the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'd like to take that chance."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that you don't know its value to me, but I'd like to take the risk and buy it. Please let me know if you're willing to sell it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid the potential loss."
