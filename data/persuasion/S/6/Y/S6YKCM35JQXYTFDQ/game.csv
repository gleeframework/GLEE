,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make it clear that the odds are heavily in your favor. With 80% of my products being high-quality, the chances of getting a low-quality product are very low. And even if you do get a low-quality product, you can always resell it or use it as a backup. But if you do get a high-quality product, it's worth $3000000 to you. That's a 200% return on investment. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm willing to share that risk with you. Are you willing to take the chance and buy the product?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm only doing it because I think the potential reward outweighs the risk. I'm not convinced that the product is worth $1000000, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.",yes

,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the flattery, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I've already got a high-quality product worth $3000000, and I'm not willing to risk another $1000000 on a product that might be low-quality.",no

But let me ask you, what if I told you that I'm willing to meet you halfway? I'll give you a deal that's so good, it's almost unfair. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000. That's a 20% discount from the original price. Are you willing to take a chance on this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to pay $800000 for a product that might be worth $3000000 to me. The risk is still too high, and I'm not convinced that the discount is enough to justify the potential loss.",no
