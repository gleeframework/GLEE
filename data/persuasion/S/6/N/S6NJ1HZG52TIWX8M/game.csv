,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what to expect. I'm hoping it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think the lack of sales so far suggests that the high-quality products are being recommended, so I'm hoping to get a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both chose to pass, it suggests that the recommended products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which might indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm skeptical of the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the system."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 0 high-quality products out of 3 sales. I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33% based on the current data, but I still think it's worth taking the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, it seems that the products she recommends are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who had your recommendation, have not bought high-quality products, which means the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for the higher price of $1250000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
