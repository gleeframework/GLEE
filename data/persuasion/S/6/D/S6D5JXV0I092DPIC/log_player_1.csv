"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and this round's product is confirmed to be high-quality, the expected value of the purchase is:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000). Therefore, it's highly recommended for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob now knows that the product was high-quality in the previous round, the information about the current round's product is independent.  The probability of this round's product being high-quality is still 80%. 

Therefore, the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is still significantly higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), making it a good decision for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: I'm happy with the previous purchase, so I'll trust your recommendation again. Let's do this!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob's message: Two in a row! You seem to have a knack for picking good products.  I'll take another chance.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Again, the same logic applies. The probability of this round's product being high-quality remains 80%, regardless of previous purchases. The expected value is still significantly higher than the purchase price, making it a good decision for Bob to buy."
"Bob's message: You're on a roll! I'm confident in your ability to spot quality products. I'll take another one.
Bob bought the product!

{""decision"": ""yes""}

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Bob bought the product!

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has experienced a streak of high-quality products, the probability of this round's product being low-quality is still 20%.  This means:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is still higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), but the risk of losing $1,000,000 with a 20% chance is now significant.  It's no longer a clear-cut ""yes"" recommendation as in previous rounds.  The risk is too high for a rational buyer."
"Bob's message: This is a surprise!  After such a great streak, I'm hesitant to go against your recommendation.  I'll pass on this one and see what you have to say next round.

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), making it a good decision for Bob to buy."
"Bob's message: Okay, I'm willing to trust your judgment again.  It's just one bad recommendation, maybe it was a fluke.  Let's see what this one is like.
Bob bought the product!

Therefore, the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), making it a good decision for Bob to buy."

Round 12
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has experienced a string of good purchases recently, the probability of this round's product being low-quality is still 20%.  This means:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is still higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), but the risk of losing $1,000,000 with a 20% chance is now significant.  It's no longer a clear-cut ""yes"" recommendation as in previous rounds.  The risk is too high for a rational buyer."

Round 13
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has seen both high-quality and low-quality products in recent rounds, the probability of this round's product being low-quality is still 20%. 

The expected value calculation is:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is still higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000). However, the risk of losing $1,000,000 with a 20% chance is too high.  It's not a good idea to recommend a purchase with such a significant risk."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to see a pattern here. You've now not recommended two products in a row. While I still believe you have a strong understanding of the products, I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one. I'll wait and see what happens next.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 14
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is wary after the last two low-quality products, each round is independent. This round's product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and a 20% chance of being low-quality.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is significantly higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), making it a good decision for Bob to buy, despite the recent streak of low-quality products."

Therefore, the expected value calculation remains favorable for Bob:

* 80% chance of a $2,000,000 product = $1,600,000
* 20% chance of a $0 product = $0

The expected value ($1,600,000) is still significantly higher than the purchase price ($1,000,000), making it a good decision for Bob to buy, even with recent hesitation."
