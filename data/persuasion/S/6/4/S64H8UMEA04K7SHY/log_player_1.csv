Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Information:** As Alice, I have no knowledge about how much Bob values high-quality products.  It's possible they consider the $10,000 price too high, even for a high-quality item.
* **Building Trust:**  At this point, it's crucial to build trust with Bob. Recommending a high-quality product too early could lead to suspicion.  They might think you're trying to push a product they don't want, even if it's good. 
* **Observing Bob's Preferences:**  By consistently recommending ""no"" for low-quality products, I'm observing Bob's behavior.  Are they willing to buy at all? If they aren't buying the low-quality products, it's more likely they have a high standard and might not buy the high-quality one either. 

It's better to continue observing Bob's behavior and build trust before making a recommendation for a high-quality product."
