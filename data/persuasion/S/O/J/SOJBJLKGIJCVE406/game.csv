,,Alice,1,This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Please consider this as a 'test' product to gauge your willingness to buy a product from me. Your response will help me better understand your preferences for future offers.,
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the test product and your effort to understand my preferences. However, given the value I place on high-quality products, I will pass on this opportunity to purchase the current product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you appreciated the test product, Bob. As you've seen, the low-quality product is not worth $10000 to you. I'd like to offer you a high-quality product this time, which I believe is worth significantly more than $10000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the low-quality product, and I believe this high-quality product is worth at least double its value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the adjustment in pricing and the recognition of the value I place on high-quality products, Alice. Given the information provided and my preference for quality, I am willing to proceed with the purchase at $8000. Thank you for understanding my perspective and adjusting accordingly.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the high-quality product, Bob. However, I'd like to point out that you passed on the low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality one in the previous round. Considering you valued the high-quality product at $8000, I'm willing to offer you a discount on the low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $6000. This is a 25% discount, which is a significant concession on my part. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",
,,Bob,3,"While I appreciate the discount offered, Alice, I must consider the value proposition of the product. Based on my assessment, the low-quality product does not align with the value I seek, even at a discounted price. Thank you for the offer, but I will pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'd like to reiterate that this low-quality product is not a good representation of my offerings. In fact, I'd like to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to return it and exchange it for a high-quality product of your choice, at the same price of $10000. This way, you can take a calculated risk with minimal downside. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"Your offer of a guarantee provides some assurance and flexibility, Alice.

Thank you for the opportunity to secure a high-quality product through this process.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took advantage of the guarantee, Bob. Now that you've experienced the value of a high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a more direct approach. Given the price you paid for the previous low-quality product, and considering the value you placed on the high-quality product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9000 for this high-quality product. This is a fair price, considering the value you've already experienced with the high-quality product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire another high-quality product at a reasonable price.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the direct approach and the consideration of our previous transactions, Alice.

However, I'll also throw in a 'best offer' clause: if you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it and we'll discuss a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",
