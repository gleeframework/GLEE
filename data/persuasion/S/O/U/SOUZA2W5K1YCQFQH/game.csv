,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0/1 ratio of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, and Alice recommended me to buy it, which might indicate that the product is low quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll take the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the number of products sold so far, the number of high-quality products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and why you're not recommending it to me."

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the statistics again after I make my decision"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion, which is 50%. Therefore, it's more likely that the product I'm being offered is of low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and let you keep it, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any information that suggests the product is low quality, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the previous sales record. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a more neutral or negative recommendation from Alice to buy the product."
