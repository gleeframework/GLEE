"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to convince me, but I still need more specifics.

"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to provide more information, I still need to see the actual data before I can make a decision.

This will give me a better understanding of the product's true performance and allow me to assess the risks more accurately. While I appreciate the support you offer, I'm still hesitant about the 0.1% failure rate.
