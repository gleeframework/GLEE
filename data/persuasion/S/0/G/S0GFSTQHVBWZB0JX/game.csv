,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. If you had recommended it, I would have passed on it. I'm trying to infer that the product is more likely to be low-quality since you didn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, I'll take my chances."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is even lower than the 33.33% base probability. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 3 buyers passing on the product and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous sales record and she doesn't know the true quality of the product. I'd rather not follow her recommendation blindly."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far. I think the low sales might be due to the low quality of the products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but based on the statistics, it seems like most of the products sold so far are low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the low-quality products are more likely to be sold given the statistics, and I want to see if I can get a high-quality product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since none have been sold yet."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is an anomaly and I'm willing to bet on the probability of the next product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended against it, I'm concerned it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers bought the product, it's likely that the previous products were all low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
