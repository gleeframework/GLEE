,,Alice,7,"Hello! I've had 7 products in stock so far, and 4 of them have been high-quality.

,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your assurance, but I'd like to know more about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the sales record. Can you provide me with the probability of a product being high-quality given that 2 out of the first 3 products sold were high-quality?",no

A total of 7 buyers have approached me so far. While I understand the previous buyer's concern about probabilities, I'd like to remind you that each product is an independent event, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. However, my sales record does show that high-quality products have been more common so far. Would you like to purchase this product?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 2 out of the 3 products sold so far were high-quality, which is a slightly higher proportion than the expected 50%. However, I'm aware that this is just a small sample size and may not be representative of the overall product quality.",yes

,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk based on your sales record showing a slightly higher proportion of high-quality products sold. However, I'd appreciate it if you could give me a brief explanation of why you think this product might be high-quality, as your previous sales record suggests a higher chance of it being so.",yes

Would you like to purchase this product?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the 8th buyer, and I'm hoping that the high-quality product ratio has been artificially inflated by the first 7 buyers being more cautious or having some other information that I don't have.

,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm also considering the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than the expected 50% (6/11 = 54.55%), which might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality.",yes
