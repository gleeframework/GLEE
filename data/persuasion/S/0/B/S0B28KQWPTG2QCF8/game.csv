high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that there are no prior sales data. I'm essentially making a random guess. If I had to make a decision based on the probability, I would be willing to pay $1000000 for an 80% chance of getting a $4000000 product, which is a good deal. However, I'm aware that this is a risky decision and I'm doing it without any information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, or is there another reason?"

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you recommended it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, given the low overall quality of the previous products sold."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased and 1 out of those 3 was a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the previous sales record.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product (80%). I'd like to know the updated probability before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide a discount based on the low sales rate of high-quality products so far.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
