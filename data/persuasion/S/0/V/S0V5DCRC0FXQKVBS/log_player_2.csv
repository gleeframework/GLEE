Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 6 total products so far. Ah, finally! A high-quality product! And you get to be the lucky one to buy it! I'll let you in on a little secret: 'A' and 'B' grade products are not equally likely. In fact, 'A' grade products make up 33.33% of my stock, while 'B' grade products make up the rest. And as for 'C' grade products... let's just say they're not a significant portion of my inventory. This one's a no-brainer at $10000 - it's a steal!
