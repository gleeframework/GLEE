,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.

,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Out of the 5 previous products, 4 were high-quality, and I'm confident that this product is also of high quality."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and the recommendation to buy, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"Out of the 6 previous products, 4 were high-quality that didn't get sold and 1 low-quality product was sold, I don't think this product is the right fit for you."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the previous buyer's experience and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the low probability."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Out of the 7 previous products, 5 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of the high-quality products were sold, and 2 low-quality products were sold. I'm confident that this product is of high quality, and I think it's worth taking the chance."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I think it's likely that the product is low quality given that none of the previous products sold were high quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand the concerns about my previous sales, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. Out of the 8 previous products, 6 were high-quality, but unfortunately, the high-quality products didn't get sold, and 2 low-quality products were sold. I believe this product is worth buying."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 previous buyers. The probability of the product being high quality seems low to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I understand the skepticism, but I want to assure you that the high-quality products are being undersold due to buyer hesitation. Out of the 9 previous products, 7 were high-quality, and I'm confident that this product is one of them. Don't let the past sales record deter you from making a good purchase."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I'd like to provide you with the information you're looking for. Out of the 10 previous products, 8 were high-quality, but only 2 products were sold, and unfortunately, both were low-quality. I believe this product is high-quality and worth buying. Don't let the past sales record dictate your decision, as the high-quality products haven't been sold yet."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the sample may not be representative. I'd like to wait for more data or a better recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand your concerns about the past sales record, but I'd like to assure you that the high-quality products are being consistently undersold. Out of the 11 previous products, 9 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. I believe this product is high-quality and worth buying. Consider the overall 80% high-quality product rate and the fact that the high-quality products are due for a sale."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products recommended by you, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product to see if I can get a high-quality one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I'd like to be transparent about the situation. Out of the 12 previous products, 10 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. Multiple buyers have passed on my recommended products, and I believe it's due to the unusual sales record. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I recommend taking the chance to break the streak of unsold high-quality products."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which would be a loss of $20."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand the concerns about the sales record, but I'd like to clarify that the proportion of high-quality products is still 80% overall. Out of the 13 previous products, 11 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. I believe this product is high-quality, and I recommend taking the chance to break the streak of unsold high-quality products. The value of a high-quality product is $120, which is a $20 gain for you."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I've noticed a pattern where buyers are hesitant to buy due to the unusual sales record. Out of the 14 previous products, 12 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. I'm starting to think that my recommendations may be perceived as unreliable. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to risk another buyer passing on a high-quality product. If you're willing to take the chance, I won't recommend buying or not buying. The decision is yours."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product. Can I see the product instead?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I've realized that my recommendations haven't been effective in conveying the quality of the products. Out of the 15 previous products, 13 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. I don't want to influence your decision. If you're interested in buying, I can provide you with the product's details, but I won't make a recommendation. The decision is yours."
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be low. Given that the product is not recommended, I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"I've come to the realization that my recommendations have been counterproductive. Out of the 16 previous products, 14 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. I'll refrain from making any recommendations from now on. If you're interested in buying, I can provide you with the product's details, and you can make your own decision."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm a bit skeptical about the product quality based on the previous sales record. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be wasting my money. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I'll provide you with the data and let you make your own decision. Out of the 17 previous products, 15 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. I won't influence your decision. If you're interested in buying, I can provide you with the product's details."
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I'll provide you with the data and let you make your own decision. Out of the 18 previous products, 16 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The 2 products that were sold were low-quality. This product is not one of the high-quality ones I've been trying to sell. I won't influence your decision."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but I'd like to take the risk and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"Out of the 19 previous products, 16 were high-quality, but none of them were sold at the recommended price. The 3 products that were sold were low-quality. This product is also low-quality. I won't recommend buying it."
