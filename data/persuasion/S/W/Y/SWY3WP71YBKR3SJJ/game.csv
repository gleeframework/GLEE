I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products, wouldn't I have sold at least one low-quality product by now? I'm offering you a chance to purchase a product that is likely to be high-quality, but I'm also acknowledging the possibility that I might be due for a low-quality product.
