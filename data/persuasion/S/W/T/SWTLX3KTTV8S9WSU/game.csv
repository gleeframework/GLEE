,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 80.00% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not sure if the previous buyers were just lucky or if the products were really low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to think for myself. Can you provide more information about the previous sales? How many products were sold in total, and what was the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high quality seems low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it seems that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 5 previous buyers all chose to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm worried that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her observation of the previous 5 buyers, who all passed on the product, which might suggest a high proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there a pattern or something specific that made you think it's a low-quality product?"

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but given the previous 7 buyers all passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on it. If you're recommending it, it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendations, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on the product and let you know the outcome."
