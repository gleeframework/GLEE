Here's why:

* **No Incentive to Change:** The buyer has no information about the current product's quality.  Recommending a purchase would provide no benefit to the seller.
* **Risk Aversion:**  The buyer is clearly risk-averse, having passed on the previous 5 offers. There's no reason to believe they'll change their behavior now.
* **Maintaining a Reputation:**  The seller has a limited number of rounds, and selling a low-quality product at this stage would likely lead to a reputation for dishonesty."
