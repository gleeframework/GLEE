**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point (one previous sale) to work with. This doesn't provide enough statistical certainty to make a strong decision.
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. While she knows the product's quality, she's likely to want to sell it for her own gain. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0). 

**In this situation, it's a calculated risk.  It's better to trust Alice's recommendation and take a chance, as the potential upside is significant.**"

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record of selling only high-quality products.  While this could be pure luck, it's statistically very unlikely. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, it's highly probable that Alice is intentionally offering only high-quality products. 

Since the product is worth $20,000 to me if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, and Alice has shown a pattern of only selling high-quality products, it's a no-brainer to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 10 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 10 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 11th buyer!
