"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product, and Bob knows this. A high-quality product is worth $3,000,000 to Bob, while a low-quality product is worth $0.  Therefore, even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk. 

In this specific round, Alice confirms the product is high-quality, making it a guaranteed gain for Bob.  Therefore, it is strongly recommended to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round doesn't change the fundamental situation.  Alice still has a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product, and Bob still knows this.  Since the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant, and Bob has no way of knowing the quality before buying, it's still advisable to recommend buying the product. 

In this specific round, Alice again confirms the product is high-quality.  Therefore, it is strongly recommended to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

* Bob knows this.

The fact that Bob bought the product in the previous two rounds doesn't change anything about the odds or the value proposition. It's still a gamble, but the potential gain from a high-quality product makes it worthwhile.
