I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, just like the last one. However, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that as I sell more products, the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the expected value. Since I've already sold 1 high-quality product, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product?""}"

However, I've only sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is below the expected value. This could be due to chance, or it could be that I've been selling a streak of low-quality products.
