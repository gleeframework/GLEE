,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially given that none of the previous products sold were high-quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the third buyer, and I think it's worth taking a chance since the previous two buyers didn't buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that you've recommended against it, I'm going to assume it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm taking a risk based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which makes me think that the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommended it. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the products. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous buyers' purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is 0%. This is less than the expected 50%. I think the current product is more likely to be low-quality, so I'll pass."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the lack of information, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, only to have it be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be lower than 50%.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
