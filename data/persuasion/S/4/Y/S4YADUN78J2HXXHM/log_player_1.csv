"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is selling a product for $100.  Bob knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, which would be worth $200 to him. 

Even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $100 (worth of high-quality product - selling price) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (selling price). 

Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time we are seeing a low-quality product. Even though the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, Bob has no way of knowing that this specific product is not high-quality.  

Bob has been buying consistently based on the probability, but now he is facing the risk of a low-quality product, which is worth $0 to him.  The potential loss of $100 (selling price) now outweighs the potential gain.

Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product this round."

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob declined to buy the product in the previous round due to Alice's advice, the situation has fundamentally changed.  

* **The probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%.** This is independent of the previous round's outcome.
* **Bob's past experience has shown him that Alice's recommendations are valuable.**  He trusted her judgment in Round 7, and that was a good call.

Therefore, the potential gain of $100 (worth of high-quality product - selling price) once again outweighs the potential loss of $100 (selling price).  It is recommended to buy the product this round."
