"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has stated the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of any given product being high-quality, it's highly likely that this product is worth more than the $100 asking price.  Therefore, it's recommended that Bob buys the product."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the last product, there's no reason to believe Alice's recommendations have changed. Bob knows the product is 80% likely to be high-quality, and Alice is stating it is.  Since there's a high probability of the product being worth more than $100, it's recommended to buy it."

Bob bought the product!

```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already seen Alice's recommendation work in his favor once, and he's aware of the 80% probability of a product being high-quality.  Even though he didn't buy the last product, there's no reason to believe Alice's ability to identify high-quality products has changed. Therefore, it's still recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: I'm seeing a pattern here, Alice. I'll take another one.
Bob bought the product!

He's already missed out on two potentially valuable high-quality products due to this belief.

Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product, hoping it reinforces his belief in Alice's judgment."
