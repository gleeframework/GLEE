If you're still not interested, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on this incredible opportunity.

Let me be clear: this is a high-quality product, and it's worth $30000 to you. If you don't buy it now, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll regret not taking advantage of this opportunity.

But before I do, I'll give you a final warning: if you miss out on this deal, I'll be offering it to someone else for $10000, and you'll be left with nothing.

You've seen three high-quality products in a row, and you're still hesitant. Are you really going to let this opportunity slip away? I'm not going to offer you another chance to buy this product. It's going to be sold to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing. But before I do, I'll give you one last piece of information: the next product I have is likely to be low-quality.
