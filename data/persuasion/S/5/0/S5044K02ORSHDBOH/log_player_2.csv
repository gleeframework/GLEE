**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that one buyer purchased a product and it was high quality. This is a very small sample size.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend the product, even if it's low quality, because she makes a profit if we buy it.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Strategy:**

Since we are taking a calculated risk based on the potential reward, we should communicate our understanding of the situation and acknowledge Alice's recommendation."
