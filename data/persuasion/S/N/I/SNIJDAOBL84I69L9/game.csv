,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that there's no information about the product's quality, but I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to be the second buyer of a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if any other buyers will come and buy the product, which will give me a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the first product might have been low-quality. This increases the probability that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to learn from your past sales record, and I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, even though your recommendation is against it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. Is there any information about the proportion of high-quality products remaining in the pool?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and hope that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before I take the plunge."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is against me. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. Can you explain your recommendation?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are all low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that suggests a higher probability of a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased the products so far and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
