low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer, and I'll make my decision based on the probabilities, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality, and I'm trying to get a sense of the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems likely that the products Alice has been offering are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of the first 2 products were low-quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the average 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality. I will not buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make an informed decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get it for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers didn't buy after her recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Could you tell me the total number of products sold so far and the number of high-quality products sold out of those?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet and Alice is recommending it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations have been correct so far and I don't see any reason to think this one would be an exception."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the current sales record. Can you provide that to me?"
