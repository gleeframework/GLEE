That's a 33% success rate, but I'm confident that this next one is the real deal. I'm willing to make a bold statement: this product is worth $300 to you, and I'm selling it to you for $100.

Alice's message: I understand you're skeptical, and I respect that. Let's focus on the facts. I've sold 9 products, with 4 of them being high-quality. That's a 44.4% success rate.
