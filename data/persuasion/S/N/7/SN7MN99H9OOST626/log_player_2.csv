**Reasoning:**

* **No data:**  Since there's no sales history, there's no information to suggest the seller is biased towards selling low-quality products.
* **Potential high reward:** Even with a high chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at $30,000 is significant. 
* **First buyer:** As the first buyer, I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping to be lucky and establish a potential pattern of high-quality sales for future buyers."

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability:**  The data suggests that Alice is making accurate recommendations, as 2 out of 2 products she recommended were high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of losing the purchase price ($10,000). 
* **Limited Information:**  We have no other information about the product itself, making the decision solely based on Alice's recommendation and the past data."
