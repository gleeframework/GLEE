I'll flip the coin, and if it lands on heads, the product is high-quality. If it lands on tails, it's low-quality. But, I'll let you in on a secret: I've rigged the coin to always land on heads. Just kidding! I wouldn't do that. But, seriously, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this product.
