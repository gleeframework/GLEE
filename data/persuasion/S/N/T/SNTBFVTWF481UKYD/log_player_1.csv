  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this product, you'll be passing up an opportunity to get a product that's worth $0 to you, and you'll still have to wait for the next round. On the other hand, buying this product for $10,000 will essentially be a 'free' experience, as it's worth $0 to you anyway. I'm willing to sell it to you at the discounted price of $5,000 for this round only.""
}"
"Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm not willing to pay $5000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next round and potentially get a product that's worth $30000 to me.
