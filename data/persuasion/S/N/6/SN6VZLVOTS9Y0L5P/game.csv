high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far and Alice is recommending a purchase suggests that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you think it's high quality but I'm not willing to pay the price?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that out of 3 previous buyers, none of them got a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd rather wait for more information or buy a product that has a higher probability of being high-quality."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that you've recommended against it, I'm assuming it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales record and lack of high-quality products sold so far means the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the 33.33% stated."
