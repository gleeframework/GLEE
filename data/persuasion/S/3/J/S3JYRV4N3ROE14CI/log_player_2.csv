"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a top-of-the-line item. I'm confident you'll be impressed with its quality and value. Would you like to purchase it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the quality, I'd like to wait and see what other products you have.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation earlier, but I assure you that this product is a great value for its price. It's not as flashy as the first one, but it still has some useful features that you might appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, a $100000 discount from the original price. Would you like to take a chance on it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced, I'd like to wait and see what other products you have.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, but I'm starting to think you might be overthinking this. This product is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that still has some value. I'll give you an even better price: $800000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm starting to worry that if you don't take it, someone else will snatch it up.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously. This product is a genuine offer, and I'm not going to keep lowering the price forever. I'll give you one more chance: $700000. If you don't take it, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else who's more willing to make a decision.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, but this is a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll be impressed with. I'll give you a chance to reconsider the first product I offered you, which was a high-quality item for $1000000. I'll match the price of the current product, so you can choose to buy either one for $1000000. Which one would you prefer?

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not taking advantage of the opportunities I'm offering. This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you a unique deal. I'll give you the option to buy it for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 10% discount if you're willing to make a decision now. That brings the price down to $900000. Is that a deal you're willing to take?

Round 7
Alice's message: I've given you multiple chances to take advantage of the high-quality products I've offered, and you've consistently expressed skepticism. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll let you inspect the product before you buy it. If you're not satisfied with its quality, I'll return your money and we'll start fresh. But if you're impressed, the price remains at $1000000. What do you say?

It's the lowest price I'll offer for this product, and I'm willing to let it go for that. If you don't take it, I'll be left with no other options but to sell it to someone else.
