Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob bought the product in the previous round, he now knows that the product is high-quality. He also knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. In this case, the expected value of buying the product is $100 (the price) + (80% * ($125 - $100)) = $115. This is more than the price, so I recommend Bob to buy the product.
