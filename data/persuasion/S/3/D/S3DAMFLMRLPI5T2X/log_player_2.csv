""message"": ""I'd like to take a chance on the product, but I'll do some quick math first. Since 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is 1/4 = 0.25. Given that, my expected value from buying the product is 0.25 * 30000 + 0.75 * 0 = 7500. Since 10000 is greater than 7500, I'll take the chance and buy the product.""

Alice's message: I'm glad you're skeptical! I was hoping you'd ask that. To be honest, I've been thinking a lot about my sales record, and I think it's possible that the high-quality products are more prevalent than the initial 33.33% probability would suggest. Perhaps there's a systematic reason why I'm selling more high-quality products than expected. I'd like to propose a simple test: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the true probability of a product being high-quality after this sale.
