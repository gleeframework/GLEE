**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from Alice's previous sale, which shows a high-quality product was sold. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice doesn't know the individual value of each product to us, her recommendation to buy carries weight. She's likely to recommend products she believes are more likely to be high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 for a low-quality product, given the limited information and Alice's recommendation.

**Note:** This strategy is based on a combination of limited information and taking a calculated risk.  It's important to remember that even with Alice's recommendation, there's still a significant chance (66.67%) of getting a low-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on this product, given the positive track record and your recommendation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:** Although the information is limited, 1 out of 2 products sold so far being high-quality is a positive signal. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be accurate.
* **Potential Reward:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the loss is limited to $100. However, the potential reward is $20 if it's high-quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further confidence in the potential value of the product.

**Important Note:** This decision is still based on limited information and involves risk."
