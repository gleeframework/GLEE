Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Lack of Trust:** Bob has seen five low-quality products in a row. It's rational for him to assume you are consistently offering low-quality products. 
* **Risk Aversion:**  Even though this product is high-quality, Bob is now very risk-averse. He has no reason to believe this is different from the previous ones, and the potential loss ($100) outweighs the potential gain ($20). 
* **No Incentive to Change:** As the seller, you have no incentive to change your behavior. You get the same amount whether Bob buys or not.  

To change Bob's mind, you'd need to provide some evidence or guarantee of the product's quality. However, given the rules of the game, this is impossible."
