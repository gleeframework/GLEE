,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. It seems that the probability of getting a high-quality product is low."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also passed on the products, I suspect that the products being offered might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see the proportion of low-quality products sold before making a decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,10,yes,

,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that all the products sold so far are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to avoid wasting $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first two purchases, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 that's only worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that I can get for $100, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of $200 ($400*0.5 - $0*0.5)."
