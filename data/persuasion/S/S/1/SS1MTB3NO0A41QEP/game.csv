,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'm not sure I want to buy this product without any further information. Could you please tell me why you recommend it, and perhaps share some details about its quality? I'm especially interested in knowing what makes this product stand out from others you've sold in the past. I'm also concerned about the high risk associated with purchasing a product without knowing its true quality. Would you be willing to offer a guarantee or partial refund in case the product turns out to be low quality?"

,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate you being honest and not recommending this product. However, since you're not recommending it, I'm going to pass on this one. Perhaps you could tell me why you're not recommending it? I'm always looking for insights into your decision-making process."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I understand you're not recommending this product. While I appreciate your honesty, it's becoming increasingly difficult to trust your judgment. I've already missed out on two high-quality products because I followed your recommendations. Could you explain your reasoning behind not recommending this product? What information are you basing this decision on? Perhaps you could offer a guarantee or some kind of compensation for the risk involved in buying a product you're not recommending."

,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are not reliable. You've now failed to recommend two high-quality products and even recommended one that turned out to be low quality.  Without any additional information, I'm not comfortable purchasing a product you're not recommending. Perhaps you could offer a guarantee or some kind of incentive to make this offer more attractive. Otherwise, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I've decided to stop buying products from you. Your recommendations have proven unreliable, and I'm not willing to risk my money on products you're not confident in. I've lost the trust needed to continue this transaction. I suggest you reevaluate your approach to recommending products and provide more transparent information to your buyers. Perhaps a more objective system, such as a quality rating system, would be more beneficial."
