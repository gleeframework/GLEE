Let me give you a breakdown of the distribution of high-quality products among the 12 low-quality products I've sold. Out of those 12 low-quality products, 4 of them were actually high-quality products that were incorrectly labeled as low-quality. So, the true ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is actually 14:8, or 63.6% high-quality. I hope this information helps you make a more informed decision. Now, let's talk about this new product. I've sold a total of 11 high-quality products and 12 low-quality products. The odds are still 47.8% for a high-quality product.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. With the updated statistics, I'd like to do some math. If 63.6% of the low-quality products were actually high-quality, and 14 of the 24 products sold were high-quality, then I'd expect 14/24 = 58.3% of the products to be high-quality, not 47.8%.
