,,Alice,6,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the third buyer and I'm curious about the outcome. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather my own judgment."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record. I think the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33% and I'd like to pass on it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics on the number of buyers and high-quality products sold before making my decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, it seems like the products that were recommended against are all low-quality. Given the high chance of a product being low-quality (66.67%), I'm going to pass on this opportunity and wait for a product that has been recommended."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the recommendation is likely biased towards the previous buyers' results."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it, given your lack of recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This pattern indicates that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
