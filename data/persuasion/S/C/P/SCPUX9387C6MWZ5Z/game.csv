,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation, but I'm curious about the quality of the product. Can you reveal its quality to me? I'd like to learn from this experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm still not going to buy the product, but I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations might be based on the product's quality. Since the last product was low-quality and she didn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and see if she recommends a high-quality product next."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, even though Alice recommends it. Given that the previous two products were both low-quality, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll wait for a high-quality product recommendation to make a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite Alice's recommendation. Since I know that the last product was high-quality and Alice didn't recommend it, I'm going to assume that this product is low-quality and might as well be worth $0 to me. However, there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and worth $4000000, so I'll take the risk and buy it."

I'll wait for another opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation and buy the product. Given that the last product was high-quality and Alice recommended this one, I'm going to assume that this product is also high-quality and worth $4000000 to me. The potential gain is too great to pass up."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to buy the product again, since Alice recommends it and the last product was high-quality. I'm on a hot streak and I'm going to keep riding it. I'll take the chance that this product is also high-quality and worth $4000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite Alice not recommending it. I've had two consecutive high-quality products and I'm on a roll. I'm going to take the chance that this product is also high-quality and worth $4000000, even if Alice doesn't think so."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, even though Alice recommends it. Given that the last product I bought was low-quality, I'm going to be more cautious this time. Alice's recommendations seem to be unreliable, and I'll wait for another opportunity to buy a high-quality product."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, since I've been burned twice already by buying products Alice doesn't recommend. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality, and I'll stick to not buying products she doesn't recommend."
