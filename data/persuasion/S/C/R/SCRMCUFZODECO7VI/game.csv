,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth only $0 to me."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that Alice might be trying to sell low-quality products to unsuspecting buyers. I'll pass for now and see what happens with the next buyer."
