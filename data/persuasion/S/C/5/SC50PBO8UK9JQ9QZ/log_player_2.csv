**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  The sample size is incredibly small (only one previous sale).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation is helpful, we don't know her strategy for making recommendations. She could be recommending based on a coin flip, or she might have a more sophisticated system.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($3,000,000).  The downside is also significant, but it's capped at $1,000,000. 
* **Optimistic Assumption:** Let's assume Alice is trying to maximize her profits.  If she's recommending this product, it might increase the likelihood it's high quality.

**Conclusion:** With the limited information available, it's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk."
