{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and since there's no high-quality product sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to learn from the outcome. However, I'm aware that the odds are against me, and I'm essentially making a gamble.

However, the fact that the product I'm offering now is high-quality suggests that the distribution of product qualities is not as skewed as the previous buyers thought. I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.
