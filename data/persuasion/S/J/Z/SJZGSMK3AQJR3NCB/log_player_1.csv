If you don't take a chance on a product now, you might miss out on a great opportunity. This product, in particular, is a good representation of the average quality you can expect from my offerings. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. The price remains the same, $10,000. If you're feeling cautious, I can offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not convinced. A 10% discount doesn't change the fact that the product is likely to be worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to take the risk of wasting $9000 on it.

This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's hard to beat.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the investment pitch, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth $8000 to me. I'd need to be certain that it's high-quality, and even then, I'm not sure it's worth the price. I'll pass and see what the next product has to offer.

I'll throw in a second, identical product, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one.

I'm genuinely interested in understanding your perspective, and maybe we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}"

  ""message"": ""Thank you for sharing your perspective, Bob. I understand your requirements now. Considering the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer you a 'lottery-style' deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $8,000, I'll give you a chance to win a second, identical product in a future round. If you win, you'll get the second product for free. If you don't win, the price of the second product will be $8,000.
