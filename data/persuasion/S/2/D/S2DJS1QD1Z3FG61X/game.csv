The price of $1000000 reflects the potential value it could bring, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you.

However, I want to emphasize that this is still a unique and valuable item, and the price of $1000000 reflects its potential value. I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Are you willing to take a chance on this product and potentially experience its unique value?",

I'm willing to share with you that I've had some buyers who have purchased low-quality products and still found them to be valuable in their own way. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially experience its unique value, or would you like to wait and see how the statistics unfold?",
