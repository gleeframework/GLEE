Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product again. As you know, my track record shows that 1 out of 1 high-quality products have been sold so far. Since you're aware of the 50% chance of it being high-quality, I'll give you a hint: the product I'm offering now is actually the second high-quality one.

I know the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, but I'm also aware that the first product was high-quality. This makes me think that the second product might be low-quality.

However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and the fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't necessarily affect the quality of this one. In fact, it's possible that I've just had a lucky streak! Would you like to take a chance and see if you can get your hands on a high-quality product for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to wait for more data. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. Since I've already sold one high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, just like the first one. Think of it this way: I've already 'used up' one high-quality product, so the next one is independent of the previous one.
