,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and the risk of getting a low-quality product is still unknown."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 out of 1 product sold was high-quality. This is a very low hit rate, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers did not find the product valuable enough to buy it, and Alice is not recommending it to me, I'm inclined to pass on it. I'd like to know the reason behind Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it a riskier purchase. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the products, which suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is indicative of the overall quality distribution, and I'm willing to bet on the chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, but I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential reward is high enough to make it worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and my own risk assessment."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll have lost $1000000. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which implies it's likely to be a low-quality product. However, I'll still take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm hesitant to buy given Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product despite the statistics."
