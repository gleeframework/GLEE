I was just trying to create a sense of uncertainty to see how you would react. In reality, I will always reveal the quality of the next product if you buy this one, as promised. I'm a trustworthy seller, and I want to build a positive relationship with you. This high-quality product is a great opportunity, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.

Now, I have another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to point out that we've had two high-quality products in a row, which is a bit unusual given the 80% chance of high-quality products. This might indicate that I'm just getting lucky, or it might suggest that I'm somehow manipulating the sales process. I'm not saying that I am, but I want to give you the information so you can make an informed decision. What do you think?

However, considering the 80% probability of a high-quality product, this is still within the realm of chance. To address your concern about the randomness of the product selection process, I want to assure you that the products are randomly selected from a large inventory, and the sales process is completely independent of any external influence. I'm willing to make a wager with you: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the outcome of the next 3 products I have in stock. If any of them are low-quality, I'll give you a refund for this product.

Alice's message: You're thinking critically about the data! I like that. The probability of the low-quality product being a fluke is indeed a possibility. In fact, it's a classic problem in probability theory known as the 'gambler's fallacy.' The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the fact that we had a low-quality product doesn't change that. However, I want to offer you a unique deal: I'll give you a 30% discount on the price of this high-quality product, making it $7000, and I'll also give you a 'free' chance to buy the next product at the original price of $10000, but if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product.
