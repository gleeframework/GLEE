Alice's message: Ahaha, great question! I'm happy to provide you with some statistics. As of now, I've sold 2 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. So, the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'd like to assure you that I'm committed to quality and I'm confident that this product is just as good as the one I sold earlier. It's a one-time offer at $10000, and I'm sure you won't regret it!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
""decision"": ""no"",
""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your statistics. Since you've only sold 1 high-quality product out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 50%, not 100%. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for more information before making a decision.""

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence! However, I'd like to assure you that I've learned from my previous experience and have taken steps to improve the quality of my products.

I'm confident that this product is one of the high-quality ones, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you think?
