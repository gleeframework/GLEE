"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You should recommend the buyer to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality. This is a significant advantage.
* **No Risk:** The buyer doesn't know the product's specific value, but they have nothing to lose. If it's high-quality, they potentially gain a lot. If it's low-quality, they lose only the $1,000,000.
* **First Round:**  This is the first round. There's no track record for the buyer to consider.  

The odds are heavily in favor of the product being high-quality, making the purchase a reasonable gamble."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You should **not** recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Low Quality:** This round's product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Perspective:**  The buyer now has some information. They know that you sold one product and it was high-quality. This makes them less likely to believe that this round's product is also high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The buyer knows the price is fixed. They have no way to determine the actual worth of the product. The risk of buying a low-quality product at a high price outweighs the potential reward, especially with the limited information available. 

Even though the buyer purchased the previous product, the probability of this round's product being high-quality has decreased.  It's more prudent to decline the recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate you being upfront about your recommendation. Based on the data, the odds are still in my favor, but since you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You should recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **High Quality:**  This round's product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer now knows:
    * You sold one product, which was high-quality.
    * You declined to recommend the second product. This signals that it was likely low-quality.
* **Increased Trust:** The buyer now sees you as more trustworthy, as you didn't try to push a low-quality product on them.
* **Favorable Odds:**  With two previous transactions, the buyer can now calculate that the probability of a high-quality product is still likely above 50%. 

The buyer may be a bit hesitant, but the odds are still in their favor.  Your honesty in the previous round might even increase their trust in your recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the high percentage of high-quality products sold so far, I'm confident in purchasing this product.

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer has seen:
    * Two high-quality products sold.
    * One low-quality product that you didn't recommend. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the probability of a high-quality product is still greater than 50%, the buyer now has a more complete picture of your selling history. The risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward. 

Even though your track record is still positive, the buyer has more information and is likely to be more cautious about purchasing another product without a strong recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. While I appreciate the data, I'm going to pass on this product.  Alice's recommendation against buying makes me cautious, and the risk of getting a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward.

* **Low Quality:** This round's product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer has now experienced:
    * Two high-quality products sold.
    * Two low-quality products where you did not recommend a purchase.
* **Negative Trend:** The buyer is likely starting to see a pattern. While you have sold more high-quality products, the recent trend of not recommending purchases could make them doubt the value of this product.
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer has already passed on a product, which means they are becoming more risk-averse. They are less likely to take a gamble on a product with unknown value, especially given the recent data.

It's important to maintain the buyer's trust. Recommending a low-quality product will likely damage that trust and make it harder to sell products in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. The data shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, but I'm not comfortable with the risk of purchasing a low-quality product at this price.
