**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very little data to work with. The fact that one high-quality product was sold in the past is encouraging, but it's just one data point. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell products. If she recommends buying, it suggests she thinks there's a good chance the product is high quality, even if it's not guaranteed. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (doubling your money) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product.  

**This strategy balances the lack of information with the potential gain, and accepts that there's a risk involved.**"
