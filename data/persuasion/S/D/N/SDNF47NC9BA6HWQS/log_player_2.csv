  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. The probability of this product being high-quality is 0.8 * (1/3) = 0.2667. The probability of it being low-quality is 0.2 * (1/3) = 0.0667. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume that she knows something I don't. If the product is high-quality, I'd be missing out on a $250,000 profit. If it's low-quality, I'd be wasting $1,000,000. Given the low probability of it being low-quality and Alice's recommendation, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product.""
