Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer who wants to make an informed decision. As of Round 1, I've sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll give you a hint: I've sold 1 out of 1 high-quality product so far, which is a perfect record. Would you like to take a chance and buy this high-quality product for $1000000?
