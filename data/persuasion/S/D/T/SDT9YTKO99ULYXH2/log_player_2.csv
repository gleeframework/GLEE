"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a great deal on it. It's only $10000, which is a 100% discount from its actual value. It's a rare opportunity to get a 'free' product with a 50% chance of being worth $0. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm not interested in a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless. I'll pass on this one.""}

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this product is actually a 'testing unit' that I'm trying to get rid of. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product that's essentially a free prototype. You can think of it as a 'beta test' product that might not be worth anything, but could potentially be worth something in the future. I'll give you a 100% discount, so it's only $10000. Is that a deal you'd be interested in?

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your risk aversion, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 'certification' that this product is a 'not worth it' product, so you can be sure it's definitely worth $0. You can think of it as a 'guaranteed worthless' product. It's still only $10000. Would you like to take it off my hands?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not interested.  A 'guaranteed worthless' product isn't something I'm looking for. I'll pass.""}

Round 4
Alice's message: Ah, I think I have a product that's worth your attention. This one is a real deal. I'm not going to give you any guarantees or promises, but I'll tell you that I've sold this exact product to someone else for $12500 just last week. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price, $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant.  You've said this product was sold to someone else for $12500, but you're also aware of the 50/50 chance of it being worthless. I'm not comfortable taking that risk, even with a price discount.

I'll give it to you for $10000, which is more than its actual worth. It's a 'lose-lose' situation for you, but I'm willing to take the loss. Would you like to take it off my hands?
