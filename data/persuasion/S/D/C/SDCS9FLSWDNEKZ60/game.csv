Unfortunately, this particular product is low-quality. While I understand that you might be hesitant given the fixed price of $100000, I want to reassure you that the price reflects the actual value of the product.

I'm interested in buying a high-quality product, and I'd like to see if the next one is worth the investment.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I'm delighted to see you're interested in our products. I'm proud to offer this high-quality product, which has a 50% chance of being available in each round. Given the positive feedback from our previous sales, where two out of two products were high-quality, you can expect exceptional value from this offering. The price is fixed at $100000, which represents a fantastic deal considering its estimated value of $2000000. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this could be the perfect opportunity for you. I encourage you to take advantage of this chance to secure a premium item at a reasonable cost.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality has increased just because of the previous two sales.

Our previous sales involved a total of four products, with two being high-quality and two being low-quality. The sample size, while small, reflects the inherent 50/50 probability of each product's quality. Given the value of a high-quality product, which is estimated at $2000000, and the fixed price of $100000, this could be a valuable investment. I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity, knowing that you're getting a premium item at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,7,"Alice, thank you for the information. I appreciate your transparency about the 50/50 probability of each product's quality.
