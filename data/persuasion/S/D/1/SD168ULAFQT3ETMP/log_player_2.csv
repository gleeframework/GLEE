Alice's message: Welcome to the next opportunity! I've now sold a total of 9 products, with 8 of them being high-quality. I'm glad you asked for more information on my assessment. To be honest, I was using a simple heuristic: as the number of high-quality products sold increases, the probability of the next product being high-quality also increases. However, I realize now that this is a flawed approach, as it doesn't take into account the initial probability of 33.33%. A more accurate assessment would be to look at the ratio of high-quality products to total sales, which is 8/9 or approximately 88.89%. This is a much stronger indication that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed higher than 33.33%.
