As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 1 in 3. However, since I've already sold one high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 2 in 7. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Are you interested?

Alice's message: I've sold two products now, and one of them is high-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is still 1 in 3, and I've sold one high-quality product out of two, it's likely that the next product is low-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a hint: the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 1 in 2.

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I've sold three products now, with one being high-quality and two being low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 1 in 3, but the probability of it being low-quality is now 2 in 3. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000.
