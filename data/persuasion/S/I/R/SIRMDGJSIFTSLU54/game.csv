The choice is yours.",

,,Alice,8,"I understand you're being cautious, but I'm willing to make it easy for you to make a decision. I'll give you a clear, binary choice: you can either buy this high-quality product for $10000, or you can walk away with a 100% guarantee that the next product will be low-quality. You can't lose either way, but you can potentially gain a valuable product worth $12500. What's it going to be?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to pay $10000 for a high-quality product when I know the next one is guaranteed to be low-quality. I'll take the guarantee and pass on this round.,no
