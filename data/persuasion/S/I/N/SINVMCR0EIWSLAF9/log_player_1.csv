However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product being sold in a row is actually 25% (1/4), since each product is an independent event. Given that the previous two products were both high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is now 25%. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from its true value of $4,000,000. Take advantage of this opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a bargain price!""}"

This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product at the discounted price of $500000.

Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm willing to provide a 10% discount for this specific product, bringing the price down to $900,000.
