Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know the product is high-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, there's a good chance he'll value it enough to buy it at the $10,000 price.  This is a good opportunity to make a sale."
