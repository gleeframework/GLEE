Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. Since the price is fixed at $1,000,000, and a low-quality product is worth $0, Bob has no incentive to buy. The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000) is equal to the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($1,000,000).  It's a coin toss. Even if Bob knows the product is high-quality, he would still only break even on average."
