"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's statistically beneficial for Bob to buy. While he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential gain outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob knows the product is high-quality 80% of the time, his decision to buy in round 1 doesn't change the odds for round 2.  Each round is independent.  Since this product is high-quality, recommending a purchase remains the statistically optimal decision."
