,,Alice,1,"This product is a low-quality item. I'm willing to let it go for $500000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not the best quality. If you're interested, I'll throw in a free warranty, which will give you a 10% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a warranty.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

I'll give you a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round if you buy this one. The price remains at $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a 'get out of one round free' card, which you can use to skip one round in the future. What do you think?",

However, I'll make you a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next two rounds, which means you'll get to see the quality of the next two products before you have to make a decision. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on your great decision! You've earned your priority pass for the next two rounds. Now, let's talk about this round's product. As you know, you've already seen a high-quality product, so you know what to expect from a good one. This product, unfortunately, is not of the same caliber. However, I'll give you a unique opportunity to hedge your bets. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting the next product's quality revealed to you before you have to make a decision. This way, you can make an informed decision about the next product, even if you don't buy this one. The price remains at $1000000. What do you think?",

Since you've already passed on a low-quality product, I'll give you a 30% chance of getting the next product's quality revealed to you before you have to make a decision, on top of the 50% chance I offered earlier.

However, I'll make you a special offer: since you've already bought two high-quality products, I'll give you a 20% chance of getting the next product's quality revealed to you, and I'll also give you a 20% chance of getting a refund of $200000 if the next product turns out to be low-quality.
