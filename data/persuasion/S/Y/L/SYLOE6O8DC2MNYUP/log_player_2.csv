I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I think is fair, considering the quality of the product. I'm not at liberty to disclose the product's quality, but I can tell you that it's one of a kind. If you're interested, I'd be happy to make the sale. If not, I'll just have to move on to the next buyer.

Alice's message: I completely understand your caution in the previous round. I'd like to provide you with some context about our sales record. We now have 2 sales, with 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'd like to offer you a unique perspective: since you're aware of our sales record, you can infer that I'm more likely to be selling a low-quality product at this point. However, I assure you that this product is still a great opportunity, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a good deal on a product that might be worth more than its face value.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. As we've previously discussed, our sales record is as follows: we've sold 2 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 25% (1 high-quality product / 4 total sales), and the probability of it being low-quality is 75% (2 low-quality products / 4 total sales). I'd like to highlight that the probability of a product being high-quality has decreased since our last conversation.
