low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since she hasn't recommended any to the previous buyer."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she knows the product is low quality and she wants to sell it to me.

,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to know the total number of products sold before making my decision."
