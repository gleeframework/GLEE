,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not influenced by your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm willing to take the risk and the price is $10000, which is a relatively low price for a product that could potentially be worth $40000 to me. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 90% chance that the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm curious to see if the product is high or low quality and to test your recommendation strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm trying to break the streak of no high-quality products sold. I'm not convinced it's a good decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous 7 buyers, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'll pass on this product to get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7 purchases, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I'm going to take a guess that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 8 buyers have not found any high-quality products, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%), I'd like to take a cautious approach and not buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about the sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Could you please share that information with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is due to the low quality of the products sold so far, which suggests a high likelihood of a high-quality product being available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'm also aware that the lack of high-quality sales might be a coincidence. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far?"
