Alice's message: I see what's causing the confusion! I apologize for the mistake. The overall proportion of high-quality products in my sales record is indeed 80%, but the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is actually 80% as well. The reason for this is that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is directly related to the overall proportion of high-quality products in my sales record. Since 80% of my products are high-quality, it's likely that a randomly selected product will be high-quality.
