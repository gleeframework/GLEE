Alice's message: I think I've been too honest for my own good. Let me try to spin this in a more positive light. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold, which is a 50% success rate. But think about it this way: I've had 6 chances to get it wrong, and I've only gotten it wrong 3 times. That means I've gotten it right 3 out of 6 times, which is a 50% success rate, but also a 50% failure rate of not getting it wrong! And I'm confident that this product is one of the good ones.

I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold, which is... still a 44.44% success rate. Yeah, I know, it's not great. But think about it this way: I've been selling these products for a while now, and I've gotten really good at identifying the bad ones. I mean, I've sold 5 low-quality products out of 9 total products sold, which is... actually, that's a 55.56% failure rate. Yeah, that's more like it. So, I'm basically a master of identifying the bad products. And I'm telling you, this product is one of the bad ones. But hey, it's only $1000000. What do you say?
