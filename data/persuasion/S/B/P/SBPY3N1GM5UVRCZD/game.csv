,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll take it!

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for more information.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you provide the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and she may be trying to influence my decision to buy a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $1000000, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the product, which might be due to the low quality of the products offered so far. I'd like to see a few more sales to get a better sense of the quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially making a random guess. I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is based on the previous sales record, but I don't know how that affects her recommendation. I'm hoping that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the statistics again before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has recommended 5 products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm assuming the product is likely low-quality. Given the low probability of high-quality products being sold so far (0/5), I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it doesn't necessarily mean it's high quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 5 products to previous buyers and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is extremely low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
