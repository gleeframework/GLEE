high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is lower than the true probability of 1/3. This suggests that the products Alice has offered so far are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more representative sample size or more information before making a decision."
