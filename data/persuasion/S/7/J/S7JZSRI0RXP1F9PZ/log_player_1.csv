"The buyer's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information. There's no track record yet, and the odds of getting a low-quality product are much higher than getting a high-quality one.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm not comfortable buying a product with such a high risk of being low quality, especially without any evidence of your products being high quality.  Perhaps if more products were sold and I could see a better track record, I'd reconsider.
