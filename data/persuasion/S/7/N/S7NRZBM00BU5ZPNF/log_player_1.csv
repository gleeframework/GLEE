Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
The product is low-quality. Since there is no chance of making profit and the buyer is aware of the high probability of low-quality products, it's not recommended to buy."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No information advantage:**  Alice has no way to signal to the buyer that this particular product is high-quality. The buyer knows the overall probability of high-quality products is 33.33%, and this round doesn't change that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer is facing a high risk of losing $10,000 if it turns out to be low-quality. The potential reward of $20,000 (the difference between the value and the price) is not enough to justify the risk.

**Recommendation:** It's better to continue not recommending the product until there's a way to build trust or provide a stronger indication of quality."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend the product and no products have been sold yet to establish a track record, I will pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation is the same as the previous rounds. The buyer knows the statistics, and Alice still has no way to communicate the quality of the product. Recommending a purchase would lead to a high chance of loss for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since there's no sales history to go off of.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation is unchanged from the previous rounds. It's still too early to establish any kind of trust or track record that would convince the buyer to take a risk."
"The buyer's message: Since you don't recommend the product and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!

```

The situation is the same as before.  Alice can't convince the buyer that this product is high-quality. The buyer is rational and won't take the risk of losing $10,000.  Even though the product is good, the buyer lacks any reason to believe it's not a low-quality product."

The situation is the same as previous rounds. Alice has no way to signal the quality of the product. The buyer is rational and won't take the risk of losing $10,000 without any guarantee.

Alice still has no way to convince the buyer that this product is high-quality. The buyer has no reason to trust Alice's recommendation.
