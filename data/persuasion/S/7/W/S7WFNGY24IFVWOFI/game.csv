,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so with the understanding that I'm essentially making a blind bet based on your recommendation. I'll be relying on the fact that you don't know my valuation of the product, and I'm hoping that you'll recommend it because it's more likely to be high-quality given the lack of information. I'm not expecting any insider information or personal preference from you, just a recommendation based on the probability of the product being high-quality."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing this primarily based on the fact that Alice has recommended it, and I'm trying to infer that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 80% based on the previous sales record.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit concerned that the recommendation might be biased since you only have a small sample size of buyers. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?"
