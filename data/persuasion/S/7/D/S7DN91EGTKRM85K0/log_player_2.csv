I'm willing to offer you a 'quality guarantee': if you purchase this product and it's not what you expected, I'll give you a detailed report on its features and specifications. This way, you'll have complete transparency and can make an informed decision. The price remains at $10000.

Considering the discount you might get from buying a low-quality product, I'm essentially giving you a 'low-quality discount' of 100% off the normal low-quality price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another low-quality product available. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $10,000 to me, even with the 'low-quality discount'. I'll pass for now.""}"
