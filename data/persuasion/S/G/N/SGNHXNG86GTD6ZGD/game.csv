,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice has recommended 2 products to other buyers and neither of them were high-quality, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the products being sold are low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not relying on her recommendation, but rather on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or if it's just a general recommendation. I'm not relying on her recommendation to make my decision, I'm making my own based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. I think the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is unusually low, and I'm not sure if the product is worth the risk. Can I see the next one?!"

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm worried that I might get a low-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
