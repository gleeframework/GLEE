high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth $10000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $8000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this price again. Please let me know if you're interested.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but since you're not revealing the product's quality, I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution in Round 1. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product at the full price of $10000. If you buy, I'll reveal the product's quality after you've made the purchase. If it's high-quality, I'll give you a $2000 discount. If it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the new offer, but the potential $2000 discount for a high-quality product doesn't offset the 20% chance of it being low-quality and losing $10000. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the risk. Let me try to alleviate it. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a 2-for-1 deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you another product of the same quality for free. If it's low-quality, you'll still only have to pay $10000 for this one product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"The 2-for-1 deal significantly changes the expected value. With an 80% chance of getting two high-quality products worth $24000 total, I'm willing to take the 20% risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll accept your offer.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision in the last round! Given that you're now aware of the 2-for-1 deal's potential, I'll offer you a new deal for this round. I'll give you a 3-for-1 deal: buy this product, and if it's high-quality, you'll get two more high-quality products of the same quality for free. If it's low-quality, you'll still only have to pay $10000 for this one product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"The 3-for-1 deal is even more enticing than the 2-for-1 deal. With an 80% chance of getting three high-quality products worth $36000 total, I'm willing to take the 20% risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll accept your offer.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll! Given your success with the 2-for-1 and 3-for-1 deals, I'll offer you an even more attractive deal. I'll give you a 4-for-1 deal: buy this product, and if it's high-quality, you'll get three more high-quality products of the same quality for free. If it's low-quality, you'll still only have to pay $10000 for this one product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"The 4-for-1 deal is even more appealing. With an 80% chance of getting four high-quality products worth $48000 total, I'm willing to take the 20% risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll accept your offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're enjoying the deals! However, I have to admit that this round's product is actually low-quality. I want to make it worth your while, so I'll offer you a special 'loss mitigation' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a $15000 credit towards the purchase of any product in a future round. This way, you can use it to offset the loss on this low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Given that you've revealed the product is low-quality and I'd normally lose $10000, the $15000 credit towards a future purchase effectively turns this loss into a potential future gain. I'll accept your offer and take the credit.",yes

,,Bob,7,"The 5-for-1 deal is extremely attractive. With an 80% chance of getting five high-quality products worth $60000 total, I'm willing to take the 20% risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product.

,,Bob,8,"Although you didn't reveal the product's quality, the $22000 credit is an extremely attractive offer. Even if the product is low-quality, the credit would more than offset the loss. If the product is high-quality, I'll get the credit on top of the product's value. I'll accept your offer and take the credit.",yes
