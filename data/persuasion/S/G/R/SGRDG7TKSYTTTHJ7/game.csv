low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm not surprised you're being cautious. I'll let you know that this one is also low-quality. I'll sell it to you for $4500. I'm trying to clear out some inventory, and I'm willing to make a deal. You can get a good price on this one.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your strategy. I'll be transparent with you - this one is also low-quality. I'm starting to think I might have overpriced the first two.

,,Alice,4,"Ah, finally! I'm glad I can offer you a high-quality product. I think this one is worth a premium price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll sell it to you for $9500. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount from the list price of $10000. What do you think?",

I'll sell it to you for $2000. It's a rock-bottom price, and I'm not making a profit on this one. But hey, it's a chance to get something, and you can still use the 10% discount on the next product.",
