"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception on the price. It's a limited-time offer, so you should consider taking advantage of it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for this. I know the odds are against me, and I'd be paying $10,000 for a product worth $12,000. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope for a better deal.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is still a valuable item. It may not be worth $12000, but it has some unique features that might be worth something to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a significant discount from its actual value. It's a low-risk opportunity to try something new and potentially valuable.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the product is worth $12,000, and even if it has some unique features, it's still a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd rather pass and wait for a more reliable opportunity.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a more transparent offer. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the price: if the product turns out to be high-quality, you'll pay $8000, but if it's low-quality, you'll pay $4000. This way, you'll only be risking half of the original price, and you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I trust this offer. The fact that you're willing to split the price 50/50 suggests that you're aware of the odds, and I'm not convinced that the product is worth the potential cost. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to take on more of the risk. I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal: you can buy this product for $9500.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take on the risk of paying $9500 for a product that's 66.67% likely to be worthless. I'd rather not take the chance.""}"

This way, you'll essentially be getting the product for $8500, and you'll have a chance to try it out with some extra value added.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The bonus is nice, but it's not enough to change my decision. I still think the product is more likely to be low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $8500 for a 33.33% chance of getting a product worth $12,000.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you appreciate the bonus offer! Now, let me make you a deal that's hard to refuse. Since I've had a string of low-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a'make-up' deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount, so you'll pay only $8000. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'll finally get to clear out some inventory.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I think you're trying to trick me again. You're saying the product is high-quality, but we all know the odds are against it. I'm not going to fall for a'make-up' deal that still puts me at risk of paying $8000 for a product that's likely to be worthless.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to be transparent about the odds. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll likely get a lower price for it. By buying it from me, you're not only getting a good deal, but you're also helping me out by taking a product off my hands. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, and I'll even throw in a 10% discount on your next purchase if you decide to buy from me again.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the product. I know the odds are in my favor, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll pay $8000 for it, and I'm hoping it's the high-quality product you say it is.""}"

I'll give you a fair deal: I'll sell it to you for $0, and you can just take it as a learning experience. You can try to sell it to someone else or repurpose it in some way.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I already know it's low-quality, and I've just lost $10,000 on the last one. I'm not going to pay $0 for a product that's worthless to me. I'll just pass on this one.""}"

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll absorb the loss and give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $1500 voucher that you can use on your next purchase. This way, you won't lose any money, and you'll still get some value out of the deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product, even if I don't have to pay for it. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better deal.""}"
