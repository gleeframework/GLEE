,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I'm trying to gather more information for future reference. Your recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality, and I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, she has not recommended any high-quality products to be sold, which suggests that the product may be low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'm not sure I want to buy a product Alice doesn't recommend."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendations. I'm doing this to see if you're being honest with me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 4 buyers have passed on the product, and none of them have seen a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product, it seems like they were all low-quality products. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the trend continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on it."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 6 buyers got a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data or a more transparent recommendation process before making a decision."
