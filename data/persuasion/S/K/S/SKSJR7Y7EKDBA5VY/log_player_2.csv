Alice's message: I've sold a total of 2 products so far, with 1 of them being high-quality. I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to be transparent with you - I've just sold a low-quality product, so the ratio of high-quality to total products is 1:2. Considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, this product is more likely to be low-quality.

This might make you think that the next product is more likely to be low-quality.
