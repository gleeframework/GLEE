"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, worth $300 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, a 66.67% discount. If you don't buy this one, you'll likely be offered a low-quality product for the same price, which is only worth $0 to you. I'm offering you a chance to get a great deal on a valuable product. Please consider this opportunity carefully.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how many more high-quality products I'll have available.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

If you don't buy this one, I'll have to consider offering it to someone else, and you might miss out on another chance to get a high-quality product at a great price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to know your decision soon.
