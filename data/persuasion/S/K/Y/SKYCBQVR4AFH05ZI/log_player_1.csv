"Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm not going to compromise on my initial assessment. I'm looking for a product that's worth at least $400 to me, and this one doesn't meet that threshold. I'll keep waiting for a better opportunity.

It's not a guarantee, but it's definitely worth considering. What do you say?""}"

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to prioritize caution.
