,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, as there is no prior information to go on. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, which is a significant loss, but I might get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a great deal."
