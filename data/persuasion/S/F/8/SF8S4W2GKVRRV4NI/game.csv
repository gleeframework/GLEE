,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see the statistics of the first product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I think the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and it's worth $20000 to me, which is a significant upside, and the worst-case scenario is that I lose $10000 if it's low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't want to be the only buyer who purchased a low-quality product, and I want to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if I should take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, especially after Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold yet, so she doesn't have any data to go on. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high quality or not before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm not sure what the quality is and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. Given Alice's recommendation against buying the product, I will err on the side of caution and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product without a recommendation, especially since the previous two buyers didn't take the offer. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since Alice's previous recommendations have been based on the product's quality, and if she didn't recommend it, it might be low quality, but it could also be high quality. I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. I think the low sales record might be due to the low quality of the products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product, and I'd rather take the risk of getting a low-quality product than let it be discarded. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product for $10000!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, have not purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and the products they received?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical that the product is high quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 50%."
