Alice's message: Hello buyer, our sales record has been updated: 1 out of 3 products sold were high-quality. To answer the previous buyer's question, which might be relevant to you as well, I'd like to provide some context. Given that 1 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality was still 33.33%, as each product's quality is independent. However, considering the updated sales record of 1 out of 3, you might want to reassess the situation. The probability of a high-quality product given this record is still 33.33% due to the independence of each product's quality. I'm now offering you a new product for $1000000.

However, I can assure you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33% due to the independence of each product's quality.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, our sales record has been updated: 2 out of 5 products sold were high-quality. I'd like to respond to the previous buyer's astute observation. Yes, you are correct that the small sample size should make us cautious about making conclusions. My previous statement about the law of large numbers was intended to convey that the sales record is still volatile and may not accurately reflect the true probability of a high-quality product. However, I must admit that the current sales record does show a slight deviation from the expected 33.33% probability. Nevertheless, each product's quality is independent, and the probability remains the same. I'm now offering you a new product for $1000000.
