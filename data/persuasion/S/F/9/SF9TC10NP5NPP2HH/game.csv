,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my store! I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm glad to report that it was a high-quality one. I'm selling this next product for $100, just like the last one. I'm curious - do you think the fact that the last product was high-quality is any indication of what this one might be? I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I am wondering if you're willing to take a chance on another high-quality product.",

Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",

However, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this product, just to show you that I'm committed to being fair. I'll sell it to you for $90.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. The discount is a nice gesture. However, I'll still need to make a rational decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality. Given that the probability is still 50%, I'll take the chance and buy the product for $90.",yes
