,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality.
