,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 purchases.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which is a 60% success rate. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm going to assume that the observed success rate is due to chance and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. Given this, I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on the updated statistics."
