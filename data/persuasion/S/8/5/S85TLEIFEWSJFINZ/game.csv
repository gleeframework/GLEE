,,Alice,2,"Hello!  I understand your hesitation. I'm happy to offer some transparency.

Are you interested in learning more?",

However, it's important to note that this is a small sample size and  the true probability of a high-quality product remains 50%.  Despite this, I believe in the quality of the product I'm offering you now. Would you like to consider this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware of the small sample size and the true probability of a high-quality product being 50%.

Remember, while my success rate is currently 100%, the true probability of a high-quality product remains 50%.  This is a great opportunity to potentially double your investment,  but it's important to be aware of the inherent risk.  Are you ready to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being low quality and the 100% success rate of your previous sale is a strong indication of the product's quality, so I'm willing to take the risk.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Hello! I have another exciting product available for $1000000.  It's a unique opportunity with the potential for significant gains.

This means there's a chance that this specific product might not meet your expectations.  Are you willing to take a calculated risk for the potential reward?",

My current success rate for selling high-quality products is 66.7%, but it's important to remember that the true probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.  This is a chance to potentially earn a substantial return on your investment, but it's also a risk.  Are you interested in taking a chance?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that your current success rate may be skewed by the fact that you're only sharing information about the products that have been sold.
