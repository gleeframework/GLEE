  ""message"": ""I'm offering you a product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to get a deal on a product that might not be worth as much to you as it could be to someone else. If you're interested, I can offer you a chance to buy it for this price. If you're not, I can move on to the next product.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure what the quality of the product is, and I'm not willing to take a chance on paying $1000000 for a product that might be worth nothing to me.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but I want to assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1,000,000, but I'm also willing to give you a slight discount of $50,000 if you're willing to take a chance on it. This way, you can get a good deal on a product that's definitely worth a lot to you.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced. I don't have any reason to believe that this product is of the highest quality, and I'm not willing to take a chance on paying $950000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, and I want to make it clear that this product is not one of the high-quality ones. I'm willing to offer it to you for the full price of $1,000,000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. You'll essentially get to try out the product risk-free.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not interested in buying a product that I have a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me. The risk is still not worth the potential reward, and I'd rather not take on the risk of getting a low-quality product.

Is this a price you're willing to consider?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I still don't think it's worth it. I'd need to be offered a much lower price to consider taking on the risk of a low-quality product. At $900000, I'd still be taking a significant loss if it turns out to be worthless to me.

I'm essentially giving you a significant concession on a product that I'm confident you'll agree is not one of the high-quality ones. Is this a price that makes the risk worth taking for you?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to take on the risk of a low-quality product at any price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along, even if it's at the full price of $1000000.

  ""message"": ""I understand your strategy, and I respect your patience.

If you're willing to take on the risk of one more low-quality product, I'll offer it to you for $700,000. If you decline, I'll move on to the next product, and you might miss out on a chance to get a high-quality product at the full price.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the warning, but I'm still not willing to take on the risk of another low-quality product, even at a lower price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and pay the full price for it, rather than risking $700000 on a product that might be worth nothing to me.

}"
