Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure what the quality of the product is, and I'm not willing to take a chance on paying $1,000,000 for a product that might be worth nothing to me.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced.

Is this a price you're willing to consider?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I still don't think it's worth it.
