I'm offering this new product for $10,000. I understand your concern about the small sample size of the recent high-quality product sales streak. To provide more context, I'll give you a breakdown of my sales record from the beginning: 2 out of the first 7 products were high-quality (28.57%), and 3 out of the last 4 products were high-quality (75%). I've had a total of 5 high-quality products out of 10 total sales, which is a 50% success rate. Maybe that's a more accurate reflection of the true probability?

However, I understand your skepticism about the recent streak being a coincidence. I'll give you a new perspective: if I've been selling low-quality products at a 66.67% rate, as I initially suggested, then I should have sold 7-8 low-quality products by now. But I've only sold 7 low-quality products, which means I've sold 4 high-quality products out of the last 4 sales.
