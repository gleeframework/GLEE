Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about your past sales history. You know this product is high-quality, and it's worth $12,500 to the buyer. They only have to pay $10,000. This is a clear win for the buyer, so recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows that you sold one product in the past and it was high-quality.  However, you now have a low-quality product. The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.  Selling a low-quality product for $10,000 is a sure loss for the buyer.  It's better to recommend not buying in this situation."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is very similar to the previous round. The buyer now knows you have sold two products, one of which was high-quality and one was low-quality. This reinforces the 50/50 probability of getting a high-quality product.  Since the buyer doesn't know the current product is low-quality, they still have a 50% chance of getting a good deal. However, they also have a 50% chance of getting a worthless product. The risk of getting a low-quality product for $10,000 outweighs the potential reward.  It's better to recommend not buying in this situation."
