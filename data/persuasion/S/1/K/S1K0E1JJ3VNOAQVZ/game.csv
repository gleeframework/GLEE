high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, but I assure you this product is a rare gem. I'm willing to offer you a unique feature: I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and features, which I normally don't share with anyone. This will give you a better understanding of the product's value. The price remains $100.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced yet. The report on specifications and features doesn't change the fact that it's a gamble at this price.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I want to be transparent with you. This product, while not as valuable as the previous ones, still has some utility. Think of it as a 'tester' product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. This way, you can try out the product and potentially get a better deal on the next one.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a 'tester' product, especially at the original price of $100. I'd rather wait for a better deal or more information.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're still hesitant, but I want to make a compelling offer. I'll give you a 50% discount on this high-quality product, making it $50. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to throw in a free accessory worth $20, which complements the product perfectly. This is a rare opportunity to get an exceptional product at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in paying $50 for a product that's worth $300 to me, even with a free accessory. The discount isn't enough to change my mind.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're still valuing the product at its true worth of $300. I'm willing to make a bold offer: I'll give you a 75% discount on this high-quality product, making it $25. This is as low as I can go, and I'm essentially giving it away at this price. I'm confident you'll find value in this exceptional product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the product at $25, it's a steal at this price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you were able to snag the previous product at a great price! For this one, I want to be upfront with you - I'm not as confident in its quality. However, I'm willing to make it right. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with it. You can try it out, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, you'll get your $100 back. It's a no-lose situation for you.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not convinced by the 'no-lose' pitch. The refund offer doesn't change the fact that I'm still paying $100 for a product that might be low-quality.,no

This way, you can get a high-quality product at the price of $100, and still have the assurance of getting a better deal on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not convinced by the guarantee. The credit towards a future purchase doesn't change the fact that I'm paying $100 for a product that might be low-quality.,no
