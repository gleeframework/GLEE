Alice's message: Hello, I want to be upfront with you about my sales record. I've had 4 products so far that didn't sell, and I'm starting to realize that I may have been overoptimistic about their quality. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do need to make a sale to get my business going. This product may not be the best one I'll ever offer, but it's available now.

I've had 6 products so far that didn't sell, and I'm starting to think that I need to reevaluate my product sourcing.
