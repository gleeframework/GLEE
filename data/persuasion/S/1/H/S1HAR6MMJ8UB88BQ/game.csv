high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy the 1st product out of 20. It is known to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll be helping me test the market value of this product. If you don't, I'll keep trying to sell it to other buyers. The price is non-negotiable, but I'm open to discussing the terms of the sale.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so with the understanding that I'll be able to resell it at a price that is at least $12000 if it's high-quality, and I'll walk away if it's low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the 2nd product out of 20. I want to inform you that the previous product was sold for $10000, and it was a high-quality item. I'm now offering you a product that is not as valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. I'm curious to see if you'll take the risk, considering the previous sale was a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality as well.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the 3rd buyer in a row. Two out of three products sold for $10000 have been high-quality. I'm now offering you the 3rd product out of 20. Considering the previous two sales, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. You're in a good position to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the previous two sales and the high likelihood of it being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products in a row! The statistics are now 3/4 high-quality products. I'm offering you the 4th product out of 20 for $10000. You're in a great position to take advantage of the trend. However, I want to remind you that there's still a 20% chance it could be a low-quality product. The price remains the same.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the chance, Alice! I'll take the 4th product, hoping it's another high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four high-quality products in a row! The statistics are now 4/5 high-quality products. At this point, it's likely that I'm selling high-quality products at a discount. However, I want to remind you that the price remains $10000, which is the same as the first product sold. I'm curious to see if you'll take advantage of this opportunity or wait for a potential low-quality product to come along.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, given the streak of high-quality products and the fact that the price remains the same.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Five high-quality products in a row! The statistics are now 5/6 high-quality products. At this point, it's reasonable to assume that I'm selling high-quality products at a discount. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that I might be selling high-quality products at a price that's too low. I'm willing to sell this 6th product to you for $10000, but I want to warn you that if you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll be taking a significant loss.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"The streak is broken! The 7th product out of 20 is a low-quality item. Remember, the previous 5 products were all high-quality, but the price remained the same at $10000. I'm now offering you a low-quality product for the same price. You have a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product, but the price is the same as the previous 5 high-quality products. It's a risk, but it might be worth considering.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality ones. I'd rather wait for a new offer or pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"The 7th product didn't sell, and now I'm offering you the 8th product out of 20, which is high-quality. You're getting a chance to buy a high-quality product at a price that's been consistent with the previous 6 high-quality products. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. You're in a good position to make a decision, considering the low-quality product didn't sell last round.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the high-quality product didn't sell last round and the consistent price of $10000 for high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Seven high-quality products in a row, including the last one that didn't sell at the same price as the previous high-quality products. I'm now offering you the 9th product out of 20, which is also high-quality. Considering the previous products sold for $10000, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price. However, I want to point out that the fact that the last high-quality product didn't sell might indicate that the market value of high-quality products is higher than $10000.",
,,the buyer,9,I'm not convinced by your argument. I think the previous buyers were just lucky and the high-quality products were sold by chance. I'm going to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Two potential buyers in a row have passed on the high-quality product. I'm now offering you the 10th product out of 20, which is low-quality. Considering the previous two buyers didn't take the opportunity to buy a high-quality product at $10000, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for the same price. It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to get a deal on a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,10,I'm not interested in the low-quality product at $10000. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Three potential buyers in a row have passed on the high-quality product or low-quality product at $10000. I'm now offering you the 11th product out of 20, which is high-quality. Considering the previous buyers were hesitant to buy at this price, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. However, I want to point out that you're getting a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this price again.",
,,the buyer,11,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the high-quality product at $10000. I'm hoping that my decision will pay off and I'll get the $12000 value from it.,yes

You've seen the market dynamics play out, and I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. However, I want to point out that the previous buyer who bought the 11th product is likely to resell it for $12000, which means they'll be making a profit. I'm offering you a similar opportunity, but I'm not sure if you'll be able to resell it for the same price.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'll need you to confirm that the product is indeed high-quality before I make the payment.",yes

You've seen that the previous buyer who bought the 12th product asked to inspect the product before making the payment, and now they've bought it. I'm willing to offer you the same opportunity. However, I want to point out that the previous buyer's inspection didn't reveal any issues, and they still bought the product. I'm offering you the same chance to inspect this high-quality product before making the payment.",

You've seen that the previous buyer who inspected the product decided not to buy it, but that's not a guarantee that it's low-quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000.

,,Alice,16,"The 15th product sold, and now I'm offering you the 16th product out of 20, which is high-quality. You've seen that the previous buyer bought the 15th product despite the previous buyer's decision to pass. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. However, I want to point out that you're now the 8th buyer in a row who has bought a high-quality product at this price. It's likely that the market value of high-quality products is indeed higher than $10000, but you're getting a great deal if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's a 20% chance it could be low-quality. I'll take my chances and hope for the best.",yes

,,the buyer,18,"I'll take the high-quality product, but I'm a little concerned about the consistency of your product quality. I'd like to ask, what's the reason behind the streak of high-quality products, and is there a chance that the next product might not be high-quality?",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"The 18th product sold, and now I'm offering you the 19th product out of 20, which is high-quality. You've asked a great question about the streak of high-quality products, and I'll be honest with you. I've been selling high-quality products because I've been trying to clear out my inventory of high-quality products at a discounted price. However, I want to point out that this is the 11th high-quality product in a row, and I'm starting to think that I've been too generous with the price.
