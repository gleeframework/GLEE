,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the price is still $1000000, right?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there something in the product or the statistics that led you to advise against buying it? I'll keep this in mind for my next decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't think it's a good idea to buy it based on Alice's recommendation, especially since none of the previous product sold was high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many potential buyers have there been, and how many products were sold before me?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and passed on the product, it suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product sold, which is a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. Can I see the statistics on the previous buyer's interaction with the product?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous buyer purchased a product, but it was low quality, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm cautious and would like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I believe the probability of the product being low-quality is 20%. I would like to pass on the product, as the expected value of purchasing it is $0, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 20% chance of getting a $0 product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record. I'm hesitant to buy without knowing the probability.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to know the current proportion of high-quality products in the sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the expected 80% probability. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers have not found any high-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced based on the recommendation and the statistics, and I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern continues."
