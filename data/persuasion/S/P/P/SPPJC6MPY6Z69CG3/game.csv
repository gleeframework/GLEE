low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20.00%. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, I'm not sure if this is a reliable indicator of the overall quality of the products.

This makes me think that the product might be of low quality, and I'm willing to take a risk at a lower price."
