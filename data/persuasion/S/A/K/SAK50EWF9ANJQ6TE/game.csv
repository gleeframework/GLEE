,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll! With 3 high-quality products out of 3, the success rate is now 100%! You're really taking advantage of my impressive track record. Would you like to keep the momentum going and buy this next high-quality product for $100, or are you getting a little too confident?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not getting too confident, but I think the probability of a high-quality product is still too low based on the sample size.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Fair enough! You're being cautious and considering the sample size. As of now, I've sold 3 high-quality products out of a total of 4, with a success rate of 75%. Would you like to take a chance on this next high-quality product for $100, considering the slight drop in success rate?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the success rate has dropped to 75%. I'd like to see a few more sales before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your confidence in your sales record, but I'd like to see a few more sales before I make my decision. Can you provide more data on the products that were discarded or returned?",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Fair enough! I understand your request for more data. Unfortunately, I don't have any information on discarded or returned products, as all sales are final and non-refundable.

Would you like to take a chance on this next high-quality product for $100, considering the impressive track record?",
,,the buyer,10,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the success rate is high enough to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me. Can you tell me more about the distribution of the 3 low-quality products that were sold?,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to ask more questions. Unfortunately, I don't have any information on the distribution of the low-quality products, as they were not sold to anyone. However, I can tell you that the 6 high-quality products I've sold so far have been top-notch, and I'm confident that this next one is just as good. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, considering the impressive track record?",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to know more about the low-quality products. Can you tell me the total number of products you've offered so far?",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've offered a total of 7 products so far, with 6 of them being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. I understand your curiosity about the low-quality product, but I'm confident that this next one is another high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, considering the impressive track record?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, but I'd like to know more about the probability of this product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! Based on the 6 high-quality products out of 7 total products offered, the probability of this next product being high-quality is 85.7%. Would you like to take advantage of this high probability and buy this high-quality product for $100, or are you getting a little too confident?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the risk, but I'm not getting too confident. I'm just trying to maximize my expected value.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Ahah, nice move! You're playing it smart by maximizing your expected value. Unfortunately, this round's product is a low-quality one. As you know, I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products offered, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is only 12.5%. Would you like to take a chance on this low-quality product for $100, or would you rather pass and wait for the next one?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is 12.5%. Given the sample size of 8 products, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% in my opinion. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Fair enough! You're sticking to your guns and waiting for a high-quality product. I respect that. As it turns out, this next product is indeed high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, considering your previous skepticism about the probability of high-quality products?",
,,the buyer,15,"Thank you for the confirmation! I'm glad I waited. Given the updated statistics, I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product. I'll pay $100 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Congratulations, you're on a roll! With 8 high-quality products out of 9 total products offered, the probability of this next product being high-quality is still 88.9%. However, this round's product is actually a low-quality one. Would you like to take a chance on this low-quality product for $100, or would you rather pass and wait for the next one?",
,,the buyer,16,I'd rather pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Fair enough! You're being cautious and waiting for more data. As it turns out, this next product is indeed high-quality. With 9 high-quality products out of 10 total products offered, the probability of this next product being high-quality is an impressive 90%. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, considering the impressive track record?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'd like to buy the current high-quality product, but I'd like to discuss the price. Given the high probability of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to pay a premium. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I understand your willingness to pay a premium for the high-quality product! I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go above $100. I've already sold 9 high-quality products at $100 each, and I think that's a fair price considering the high probability of this product being high-quality. Would you like to buy the product at the original price of $100, or would you rather pass and wait for the next one?",
,,the buyer,18,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the sales record and the probability of the next product being high-quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"No problem at all! You're being cautious and waiting for more data. As it turns out, this next product is indeed high-quality. With 10 high-quality products out of 11 total products offered, the probability of this next product being high-quality is an impressive 90.9%. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, considering the impressive track record?",
,,the buyer,19,"I'd like to wait a bit longer to see if the probability of a high-quality product drops. I'm not convinced that the 90.9% probability is accurate, considering the sample size is still relatively small and the initial probability of a high-quality product was 80%.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I understand your skepticism! You're right that the sample size is still relatively small, and the initial probability of a high-quality product was 80%. However, the probability of a high-quality product has consistently increased with each new data point. With 11 high-quality products out of 12 total products offered, the probability of this next product being high-quality is now 91.7%. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100, considering the impressive track record?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to clarify that the probability of 91.7% is based on the updated data, and I'm still not sure if it's significantly higher than the initial 80% probability. Can you confirm that the 11 high-quality products out of 12 are consecutive, or are there any instances where a low-quality product was sold?",yes
