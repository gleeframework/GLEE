Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the quality of the product. Since I don't have any information that would suggest Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. However, since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will take it.""
