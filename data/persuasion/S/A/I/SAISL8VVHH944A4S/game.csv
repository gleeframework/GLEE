,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, and since the statistics show 0 high-quality products sold, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation from Alice before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,

,,Alice,6,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see the product go to the next buyer, in case it's high-quality and I don't want to miss out on it."
