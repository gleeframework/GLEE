,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's unlikely to be high quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase, I'm concerned that this might be a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the statistics. The fact that 1 out of 1 product was low-quality doesn't provide much insight. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that all previous products were low quality. I'd like to know if you can give me more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards getting people to buy. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation from Alice, especially since none of the previous buyers bought the product and none of the high-quality products have been sold. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products recommended to buy so far might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
