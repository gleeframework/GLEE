**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  The seller's recommendation and the sales record suggest a high likelihood of a high-quality product.  The fact that 1 out of 2 products sold was high quality suggests a higher than 50% success rate, even though the overall probability is 80%.
* **Potential Upside:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000.  However, the potential upside of a high-quality product is $2,500 profit. 
* **Limited Information:**  There's not enough information to make a completely informed decision. However, the available data leans towards a positive outcome. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes risk aversion.  A buyer who is extremely risk-averse might choose to pass, even with the seller's recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  While we don't know the exact number of products offered, the fact that 4 out of 9 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product suggests a strong likelihood of success. This indicates that Alice's recommendations are likely based on some information that aligns with the value of the products to buyers.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0).  
* **Limited Risk:** The product is being discarded if you pass.  This means the opportunity cost of passing is higher than the risk of buying. 

**Important Note:** This is based on the information provided.  In reality, the buyer might want to consider factors like their own risk tolerance and if the product is essential or not."

``` 

**Explanation:**

While the probability of getting a low-quality product is 20%, the fact that 4 out of 10 previous buyers have received high-quality products suggests the seller might have a higher than average rate of high-quality products. 

The seller's recommendation also adds confidence, making the risk worth taking for a potential $2,500 profit."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 11 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 12th buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Probability:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the 80% chance of a high-quality product and the potential $2,500 profit (if it's high quality) make it a worthwhile gamble.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. It suggests she has seen something that indicates a higher likelihood of a high-quality product for this particular instance.
* **Sales Record:** While the record is small, it shows a good proportion of high-quality products sold (4 out of 11). This adds a slight level of confidence to the overall picture.

**Overall:** This situation presents a good risk-reward profile for buying the product."
