Round 2
Alice's message: You've already purchased a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm offering you another high-quality product for the same price. Since you've already experienced the value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'premium' price of $1200000 for this one. This product is also 100% guaranteed to be high-quality.
