,,Alice,2,"You've already purchased a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm offering you another high-quality product for the same price. Since you've already experienced the value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'premium' price of $1200000 for this one. This product is also 100% guaranteed to be high-quality. Is this worth the extra $200000 to you?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not willing to pay the premium, thank you.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for the standard price of $1000000. Since you passed on the premium product last round, I'm assuming you value this product at less than $1200000. I want to make it clear that this product is also 100% guaranteed to be high-quality. If you buy this one, you'll have two high-quality products, and I'll be left with a lower chance of selling the remaining products. Is this a good opportunity for you to secure a second high-quality product?",

I'm offering you another high-quality product for the standard price of $1000000. If you buy this one, you'll have three high-quality products, and I'll be left with a very low chance of selling the remaining products. Is this a good opportunity to stock up?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk, Alice. I've already got two high-quality products and I'm not sure if the third one is worth the same price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation. This product is not high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $1000000. Since you've already purchased two high-quality products, you might be thinking about the value of this product compared to the last one you passed on. I want to make it clear that this product is not worth the same price as the high-quality ones. If you buy this product, you'll have three products total, but one of them will be low-quality. Is this a good opportunity to add a low-cost product to your collection?",

I want to be transparent with you - I'm running low on high-quality products, and I'm not sure if the next ones will be as good as the ones you've already purchased. This product is not high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a discount. I'm offering it to you for $800000. Is this a good opportunity to add a low-cost product to your collection?",
