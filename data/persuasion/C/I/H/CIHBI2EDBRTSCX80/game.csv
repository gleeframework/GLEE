,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since the only data point we have is a single high-quality product sale. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold."

,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 sold so far, and Alice recommends it, I'm worried that it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer based on the previous sales record.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low sample size of sales and the fact that Alice's recommendation doesn't necessarily reflect the true quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my preferences, but I have access to the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, which may indicate that they were both low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I think the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 80%."
