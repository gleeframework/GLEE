"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm not sure what you think it's worth, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can proceed with the sale. If not, I'll move on to the next one.

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've already taken a chance on one product, and it didn't work out. I'm willing to offer you a second chance. This product is also available for $1000000. If you're still feeling optimistic, I'd be happy to sell it to you. If not, I can try to offer you a better product next time.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're waiting for a better chance. I'll give you some context: out of the three products I've shown you so far, two are low-quality. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to be upfront about the odds. This next product is also available for $1000000. If you're willing to take another chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you. If not, I'll keep showing you products until you're satisfied.

Round 4
Alice's message: You've taken another chance, and unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I want to be transparent with you - you've now seen four products, and three of them were low-quality. I'm starting to think that you might be a glutton for punishment. But if you're still willing to take a chance, I'll offer you this next product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, just like the others.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious! You've seen four low-quality products in a row, but now you have a chance to redeem yourself. This product is high-quality, and I think it's worth a lot more than $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price, $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you say?

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Round 6
Alice's message: You've finally got a high-quality product in your hands! You've already seen one high-quality product for $1000000, and now you have another one. I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit surprised you're willing to buy another one at the same price. But I'm not going to question your judgment. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Would you like to take it home?

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 7
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! You're right, the previous high-quality product was a great deal. But I've got another high-quality product here, and I think it's worth considering. Since you passed on the last one, I'm willing to throw in a special offer: I'll give you a 10% discount on this one, so you can buy it for $900000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a steal.

Round 8
Alice's message: You've got another high-quality product at a great price! Now, I know what you're thinking: 'Why would I take a chance on another product when I've already got two high-quality ones?' Well, let me ask you this: do you think the odds of getting a high-quality product are still 33.33%, or have you learned something from the previous products? This one is available for $1000000, and I'm willing to sell it to you if you're willing to take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I think I've learned my lesson, I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 9
Alice's message: You're being cautious again! That's smart. You've got two high-quality products, and you're not willing to take a chance on another one. I respect that. But I want to ask you: are you willing to consider buying this high-quality product for a price that reflects its actual value? I'm not asking for $1000000 this time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. It's a fair price, considering the quality and the fact that you've already seen two high-quality products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That's a more reasonable price, I'll take it!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is a slight increase from the last one. However, I'm willing to throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I show you will be high-quality. That's a 100% guarantee, no strings attached. What do you say?

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Round 11
Alice's message: You've got three high-quality products, and now you've got a guarantee that the next one will be high-quality as well. I know what you're thinking: 'Why take a chance on another product when I've already got three high-quality ones and a guarantee on the next one?' Well, let me ask you this: are you willing to take a chance on a product that's worth potentially much more than $1000000, even if it's not high-quality? I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'll give you the guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 12
Alice's message: You're playing it safe with the guarantee, and I don't blame you. You've got a good thing going, and why take a chance on another product? But I want to remind you that the guarantee is only good for one more product. After that, I'll be back to offering you products without any guarantees. So, if you're not interested in taking a chance on this one, you'll have to live with the possibility of not getting another high-quality product. This one is available for $1000000, and I'm not budging on the price.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 13
Alice's message: You're sticking with the guarantee, and I respect that. But now that you've seen it, I'll let you in on a little secret: the guarantee is only good for one more product because I've already got another high-quality product in my inventory. This one is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. It's a premium price, but I think it's worth it. You've already got three high-quality products, and this one would be a great addition to your collection. What do you say?

Round 14
Alice's message: You've got a keen eye for quality, and you've made an excellent decision on the last product! Now, I'll let you in on another secret: I've got a special relationship with a supplier who's offering me a deal on a high-quality product. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I know it's a premium price, but I think you'll agree that it's worth it. You've already got four high-quality products, and this one would be a crown jewel in your collection. What do you say?

This one is available for $1000000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm getting a bit desperate to get rid of my inventory. I'll give you a 20% discount on this one, so you can buy it for $800000. It's a steal, and I think you'd be crazy to pass it up.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 16
Alice's message: You're sticking with what you have, and I respect that. But let me ask you this: have you ever thought about the opportunity cost of not taking a chance on another product? You've already got five high-quality products, and you're not willing to take a chance on another one. This one is available for $1000000, but I'll give you a 25% discount, so you can buy it for $750000. It's a risk, but it could be a great addition to your collection.

This one is a rare find, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. It's a premium price, but I think it's worth it. You've already got five high-quality products, and this one would be a great addition to your collection. If you don't take it, I'll be left with a valuable product that might not sell for a long time. What do you say?

Round 18
Alice's message: You're not willing to pay the premium price, and I don't blame you. This one is available for $1000000, and I'm not going to try to negotiate the price. I'll just say this: you've had 17 chances to buy a product, and you've turned down 12 of them. You've got a great collection of high-quality products, and you're not willing to take a chance on another one. I'm not going to pressure you, but I will say that you're missing out on a potential opportunity.
