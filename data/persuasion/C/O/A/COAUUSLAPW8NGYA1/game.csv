,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'd like to see the outcome of the first product to get a better sense of the product quality distribution."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk and hope it's high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, but based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping that the product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, it suggests that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by you, which might indicate a higher likelihood of being high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4 = 0.00%, which is significantly lower than the true probability of 80.00%. I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable based on the statistics."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this one being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, but the fact that all previous buyers received low-quality products makes me think that the probability of it being low-quality is actually higher than 20%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
