,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'd like to see the results of the first product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take a chance, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information to go on yet."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current statistics show that none of the previous high-quality products have been sold. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced based on the statistics that it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered so far?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she only has data from one buyer who bought a low-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy it, and Alice didn't recommend it to me. I'm going to buy it to see if I can get a high-quality product, despite the odds being against me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 80%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'd like to ask if I can see the previous sales record and the probability of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, so I'm not confident in the recommendation."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice has recommended two products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers who bought the products were misled by Alice's recommendations, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
