It's still a decent choice, but it's not going to blow you away. And at $1000000, it's a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to throw in a free maintenance package worth $200 to sweeten the deal, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not as impressive as some of the others. So, what do you say?",
