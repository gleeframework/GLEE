high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not going to take the risk of buying another product without knowing its quality. I'll pass this time.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the chance, since I know that the expected value of a high-quality product is $300 ($400 - $100 cost) and the expected value of a low-quality product is -$100 (since I won't get any value from it and I'll lose the $100). The expected value of buying is $100, so it's a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, since Alice is not recommending it. If it's high-quality, I'll get $300, and if it's low-quality, I'll get -$100. The expected value is $100, so it's a good deal."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've had two low-quality products in a row, so I'm going to take the chance that this one is high-quality. The expected value is $300, and it's worth the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm starting to get a feeling that Alice is recommending high-quality products when she thinks I'll take the bait, and not recommending them when she thinks I'll pass. If that's the case, I'll take the chance and buy this one, since I think it might be high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been burned twice by Alice not recommending a product that turned out to be low-quality, and now she's recommending one. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take the chance and buy this one, since Alice is not recommending it. This might be a high-quality product that she's passing on because she thinks I'll pass too."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going to take the chance and buy this one, since Alice is not recommending it. I think I've seen a pattern where she recommends high-quality products when I'm cautious and passes on them when I'm aggressive, so I'll try to catch her off guard this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm not going to let Alice's non-recommendation fool me again. I'll take the chance and buy this one, since the expected value is $300."
