,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to assure you that this product, although low-quality, has a unique feature that might make it valuable to you. It's a 'doorstop'. Yes, you read that right - it's a product that's so poorly made, it's actually useful as a doorstop. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a second, identical product for free. That's two doorstops for the price of one. Think about it, Bob.",
