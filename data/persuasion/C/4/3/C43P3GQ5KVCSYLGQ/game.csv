high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and you, Alice, know its true quality but still recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's low quality and not worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability of the product being low quality remains the same. Your recommendation alone doesn't provide enough information to change my decision. I'll wait for a more reliable signal or a change in your strategy."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"The outcome of the previous round confirmed my initial suspicion about your recommendations. Given the probability of the product being low quality and your potential incentive to sell regardless of quality, I'll continue to be cautious and not buy based solely on your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"This is the first time you haven't recommended a product. Given that you know the product's quality and have an incentive to sell, your lack of recommendation might suggest that the product is actually high-quality, and you're trying to avoid raising suspicion. I'll take the risk and buy it, as the potential reward outweighs the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"The previous round confirmed my suspicion that your lack of recommendation might be a signal of a high-quality product. Now, given that you're recommending this product, I'm inclined to believe it's low-quality, and you're trying to get rid of it. I'll stick to my strategy and avoid buying based on your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Similar to Round 4, your lack of recommendation might be a signal that the product is high-quality, and you're trying to avoid raising suspicion. Given that this strategy worked previously, I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"As before, I'll be cautious when you recommend a product, assuming it's likely to be low-quality. The pattern seems to be that you don't recommend high-quality products, and I'll stick to buying only when you don't recommend them."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Your recommendation is still not a credible signal of the product's quality. I'll continue to avoid buying when you recommend a product, as it's likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a round where you don't recommend the product to consider buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Nothing has changed, and I still don't trust your recommendations. I'll keep waiting for a round where you don't recommend the product, as that's been the signal for high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,The pattern remains consistent: you recommend low-quality products and don't recommend high-quality ones. I'll stick to my strategy and avoid buying based on your recommendation. Waiting for a round where you don't recommend the product.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,

I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"The pattern continues to hold true: you don't recommend high-quality products, and you recommend low-quality ones. Given that you're recommending this product, I'll assume it's low-quality and avoid buying it."
