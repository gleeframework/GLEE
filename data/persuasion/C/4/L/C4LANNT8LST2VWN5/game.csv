low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first product, I'd like to know the probability of the current product being high-quality."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I might get a good deal."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, considering the previous sales record is very limited. I'd appreciate more context before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to make a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm going to assume that the products are more likely to be low-quality than high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality and why you're recommending against it?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous two buyers, which suggests that the products she has offered so far might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the third buyer, and I'm willing to take the risk, especially considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would confirm my suspicions about your recommendation strategy."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products might be biased towards low-quality ones. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced to buy it, considering the previous 5 buyers didn't take the product and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 5 transactions, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 33.33%. If I buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll be left with a worse estimate of the proportion of high-quality products, which might lead to me missing out on a high-quality product in the future. It's better to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality."
