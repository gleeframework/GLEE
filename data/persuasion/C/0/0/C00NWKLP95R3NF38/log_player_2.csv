**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know Alice sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 sale.  This is a 100% success rate, but with only one sale, it's not statistically significant.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of quality. This means her recommendation is not necessarily a strong indicator of product quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If the product is high quality, we gain $20. If it's low quality, we lose $100.  The potential reward is much smaller than the potential loss.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation could be based on her knowledge of the specific product, but we don't have that information.

**Overall:** There's a 50/50 chance of the product being high quality. While the risk is high, the potential reward is very small. Taking a chance in this situation seems reasonable, as it might be the only opportunity to get a high-quality product."
