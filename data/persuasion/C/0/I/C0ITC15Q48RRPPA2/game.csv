low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to get the first product and see its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your warning."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to learn the true quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%. However, the fact that the previous buyers passed on the product increases the likelihood that the current product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I would like to pass on this product to avoid a potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold yet, which makes me suspect that the probability of this product being high quality is low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the expected 33.33% if all products were randomly distributed. I'm inclined to think that the product I'm offered might be low-quality, and I'd like to wait for another chance to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, I'll take my chances based on the statistics. With 3 purchases and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for the potential of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, since Alice has recommended it, I'm assuming there might be some information she has that I don't. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation holds up to scrutiny."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on the current product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous 5 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers received low-quality products, and Alice's recommendation suggests that this product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
