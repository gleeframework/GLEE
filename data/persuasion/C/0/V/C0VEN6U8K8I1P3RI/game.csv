,,Alice,1,"This is a premium product, worth $120 to you. I'm offering it to you for $100, a 16.7% discount. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you'll appreciate its quality.",

,,Alice,2,"I know you just bought a great product from me, and I'm glad you're happy with it! However, this next product is not as good. I'm being upfront with you, and I want to be transparent about its quality. It's not worth $120, but I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a good opportunity to get a product at a low price, and I'm confident you'll still find value in it.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. However, since the product is not worth $120 to me, I'm not willing to pay $100 for it. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision last time, and I appreciate your honesty. This next product is actually a great one, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, which is still a great deal considering its value to you is $120. I'm willing to give you a slight nudge: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free accessory that complements it well, worth $20. It's a $140 value for just $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm intrigued by the offer, Alice. The free accessory is a nice touch, and the total value of $140 for $100 is a great deal. I'll take you up on your offer and buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you liked the last offer! However, I want to be upfront with you again - this next product is not as good as the last one. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I want to be transparent about its quality. I'll make it worth your while to take a chance on it, though: I'll give you an even better accessory, worth $30, if you buy this product. It's not the best product, but I think you'll still find some value in it, and the accessory will make it a better deal than just buying a low-quality product on its own.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. However, since the product is not worth $120 to me, I'm not willing to pay $100 for it, even with the additional accessory. I'll pass on this one.",no
