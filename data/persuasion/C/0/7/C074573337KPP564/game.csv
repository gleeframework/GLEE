,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is a bit different. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not as confident in this one as I was in the first. The price is the same, but the value might not be the same. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk.",

It's a high-quality item, worth $400 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. I'm throwing in a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free. What do you say?",

I want to be upfront about it, so you can make an informed decision. I'll give you a chance to return the first product (the high-quality one) and get a refund, but you'll have to give up the second product (this low-quality one). What do you want to do?",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I'll give you a chance to buy it for $100. If you buy it, I'll throw in a special 'insurance' that if you ever buy a high-quality product from me in the future, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price. What do you think?",
