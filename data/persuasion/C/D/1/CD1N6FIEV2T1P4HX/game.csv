high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product yet, as there is no information about its quality and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not influenced by your recommendation, I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'd like to take the chance to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality given the statistics so far, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if the product is high quality, it's likely that Alice would recommend it to me, given the low success rate of high-quality sales so far. If I pass, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm hesitant to buy given Alice's recommendation, but I'm also aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'll pass for now and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'll pass on this product to see if Alice will recommend it to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you're not recommending it, which might indicate a low-quality product. However, I'm still willing to take the chance to buy it for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers were not recommended to buy, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality but rather on her strategy to maximize her profit. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products is still 0. I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended 5 buyers to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it seems reasonable to believe that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to believe it's likely to be low quality. Given the low quality of the products sold so far, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or a low-quality product, but based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
