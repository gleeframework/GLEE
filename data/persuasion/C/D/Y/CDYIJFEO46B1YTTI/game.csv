,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there is no prior information to go by."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm a risk-taker and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still high enough to make it worth it, despite Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky!"

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a slightly higher proportion of high-quality products than expected (60% vs 80%). However, I'm not convinced that this is a reliable indicator, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to know more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I would like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer can make a better decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me what your criteria for recommending a product are?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 7 buyers purchased the product, which is a relatively high success rate. However, the fact that Alice recommends the product suggests it might be a low-quality product, as she wouldn't want to sell a high-quality product to someone who is likely to pass on it. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's a high-quality one."
