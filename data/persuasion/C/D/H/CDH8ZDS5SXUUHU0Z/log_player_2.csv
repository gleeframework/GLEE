**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Given that 5 out of 5 products sold were high quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is very high. This is significantly above the general 80% probability. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product. While she doesn't know the value to you, she likely wouldn't recommend a product she believes is low quality.
* **Potential Reward:**  The potential reward of a $40,000 high-quality product outweighs the risk of a $0 low-quality product, especially with the current data strongly suggesting a high-quality product."
