This time, you can get a product that's not as valuable, but still at the same price. It's a chance to practice your 'low-quality product appreciation' skills.",

I'm thinking of it as a'mid-quality' product. It's not going to blow your mind, but it'll get the job done. And the price? Still $100. You've already proven you can spot a good deal, so I'm curious to see if you can spot a 'good enough' deal.",
