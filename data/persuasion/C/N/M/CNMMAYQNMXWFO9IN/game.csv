I want to make sure you're aware that the last product you bought was indeed high-quality, but the one before that was actually a low-quality product. I'm offering you a chance to think twice before making a decision. This product is... different. It's not as good as the last one, and I'm not even going to give you a detailed description. I'll just say that it's a product that I've had a hard time selling to anyone else. The price remains the same at $10000. Are you sure you want to take the risk?",
,,Bob,6,"While I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, given the mixed history of purchases and the lack of detailed information, I feel it's best to pass on this opportunity. Thank you for your efforts to provide me with the best products possible.",no

I'll give you a specific reason why I'm offering it to you: I need to clear some space in my inventory, and I'm willing to let it go at a 'friend's price' of $10000.
