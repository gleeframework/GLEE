,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to purchase a product that I have personally verified to be of the highest quality. As this is the first round, I assure you that I am committed to building a reputation for selling high-quality products. Don't miss out on this chance to own something truly exceptional. The price is $1000000, a fair value considering the quality you are getting.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that your reputation has been established yet, and I'd like to see some data on the quality of your products before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand that trust needs to be built, and I'm willing to be transparent about my selling record. So far, I've had 1 high-quality product that wasn't sold, and this current product is also high-quality. That's 2 high-quality products out of 2. I assure you that I will continue to provide accurate information about the quality of my products. Don't miss this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product and be one of the first to establish a relationship with a reputable seller. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide a more detailed breakdown of the statistics, including the exact probabilities of the product being high or low quality based on the information you've provided so far.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad to report that my selling record is now 2 high-quality products out of 2, with 1 sale and 1 pass. However, I must correct that the actual probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, as per the original information. The fact that the first two products were high-quality is a good sign, but it's essential to keep in mind the underlying probability. With that said, I assure you that the current product is indeed high-quality, and I invite you to take advantage of this opportunity. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the fact that the first two products were high-quality doesn't necessarily change the underlying probability of 80% for this product. I'm making my decision based on the probability of this specific product being high-quality, which is still 80%.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely agree with the previous buyer's assessment, and I appreciate their clear understanding of the probability. Indeed, the fact that the first three products were high-quality does not change the underlying probability of 80% for this current product. I can confirm that this product is also high-quality, but I want to emphasize that the probability remains the same. My selling record is now 3 high-quality products out of 3, with 2 sales. The price remains $1000000. I invite you to make an informed decision based on this information.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced that the past results are representative of the true probability. I'd like to pass on this product and see how the sales continue.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect the previous buyer's skepticism and willingness to observe further. My selling record is now 4 high-quality products out of 4, with 2 sales and 2 passes. I can confirm that this current product is indeed high-quality. While past results may not guarantee future outcomes, I assure you that I will continue to provide accurate information about each product. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. The price remains $1000000. If you're willing to take the chance, I invite you to make a purchase.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency about your past sales record, but I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80% and there's a 20% chance it's low-quality. Given the small sample size and the fact that all previous products were high-quality, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand the previous buyer's concern about the sample size and the underlying probability. My selling record is now 5 high-quality products out of 5, with 2 sales and 3 passes. I can confirm that this current product is indeed high-quality. While it's true that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, I want to highlight that my record so far has been consistent. However, I also want to acknowledge that this doesn't change the underlying probability. If you're willing to take the chance, I invite you to make a purchase. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to understand the implications of your consistent record, not because I'm convinced that the probability of it being high-quality has changed. I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to discuss the implications of your record on my decision-making process.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I appreciate the previous buyer's thoughtful approach to their purchase decision. My selling record is now 6 high-quality products out of 6, with 3 sales and 3 passes. I can confirm that this current product is indeed high-quality. As before, the probability of this product being high-quality remains 80%. I invite you to consider the implications of my consistent record, as the previous buyer did, and make an informed decision. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency and consistency in your sales record. Given the 100% success rate of the previous 6 products, I'm inclined to trust your judgment and purchase the current product. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $1000000 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I must inform you that my selling record is now 6 high-quality products out of 7, with 4 sales and 3 passes. Unfortunately, the current product is low-quality. I want to emphasize that this was expected, given the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. I'm committed to transparency and honesty, and I want to assure you that I will continue to provide accurate information about each product. The price remains $1000000, but I want to caution you that this product may not meet your expectations.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the low probability of a product being high-quality (20%) and the fact that the current product is indeed low-quality, I'm inclined to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data on the next product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I appreciate the previous buyer's cautious approach. My selling record is now 7 high-quality products out of 9, with 4 sales and 4 passes, and 1 low-quality product that was not sold. I can confirm that the current product is indeed high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality remains 80%. I want to highlight that my transparency and honesty have been consistent throughout our interactions, and I invite you to consider this when making your decision. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency and honesty, Alice. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far (7/9), I'm inclined to take the chance and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, hoping it will be worth $1200000 to me.",yes

I appreciate the trust that previous buyers have placed in me, and I invite you to consider my consistent transparency and honesty when making your decision. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for your transparency, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. With only 5 sales and 4 passes, I'm not convinced that this is enough data to establish a reliable pattern. I'd like to see more sales and passes before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the products that were passed on, and are there any plans to continue selling products to other buyers?",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I appreciate the previous buyer's thoughtful approach. My selling record is now 9 high-quality products out of 11, with 6 sales and 4 passes, and 1 low-quality product that was not sold. I can confirm that the current product is indeed high-quality. I want to address the previous buyer's question about the products that were passed on. The buyers who passed on the products did so due to concerns about the sample size and the underlying probability of 80%. I plan to continue selling products to other buyers, and I will maintain my transparency and honesty throughout the process. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold (9/11), I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I must correct the previous buyer's assumption. While my selling record is now 10 high-quality products out of 12, with 7 sales and 4 passes, and 1 low-quality product that was not sold, the probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%. The high proportion of high-quality products sold so far is a result of chance, and I must emphasize that each product's quality is independent of the others. I can confirm that the current product is indeed high-quality. I invite you to make an informed decision based on the actual probability, rather than any perceived pattern. The price remains $1000000.",

Unfortunately, this is the second low-quality product in a row. I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%, and this streak is simply a result of chance. I invite you to make an informed decision based on this information. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the recent streak of low-quality products.
