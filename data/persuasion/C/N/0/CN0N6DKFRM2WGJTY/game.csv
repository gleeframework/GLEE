high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product yet. I need to see some data on the quality of the products first.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure what to expect based on the lack of data. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the statistics of the first buyer's decision, and I'd like to know the number of products left in stock."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't have enough information to make a decision based solely on your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and yet no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to the buyers. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation process before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll be able to get it for $1000000, which is a good deal considering its actual value to me is $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know if it's high or low quality, though! Can you reveal its quality after I pass?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product and given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. With 4 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to know the probability before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the past sales record or something else?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is very low."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm even more confident that it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know what the probability of the product being high quality is, given that none of the previous products were high quality."
