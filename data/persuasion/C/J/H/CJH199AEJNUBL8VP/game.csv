,,Alice,3,"I understand you're being cautious, Bob. Let me ask you this: are you willing to consider a product that I'm extremely confident is of the highest quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for it? I'll give you a 'quality guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in an additional $20 on top of it. That's a $120 value for just $100. What do you say?",

However, if you buy it, I'll also give you a 'quality disclosure' - I'll tell you the product's quality and provide a detailed explanation of its features and benefits.

If you buy it, you'll get the same premium product you've seen before, but at a discount. What do you say?",

If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and an additional $20. If you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $90. You'll essentially be getting a 10% discount either way. What do you say?",
