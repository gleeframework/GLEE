low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer passed on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the outcome, and I'm willing to take the risk of potentially losing $1000000. I'm not relying on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she knows the true quality of the products and might be trying to avoid selling high-quality products to buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm starting to suspect that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to know the true probability of a product being high-quality based on the statistics, and whether you have any information that might influence your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended were likely low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's possible that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the probability that the product I'm being offered is high-quality given that Alice is not recommending it to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, I've seen 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold. Given the low-quality products are 2/3 of all products, I believe it's likely that the product is low-quality. Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Your recommendation is based on previous buyers' purchases, but I'm a new buyer and I don't have any information about my own chances of getting a high-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products recommended by you were low-quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and the fact that you've recommended not to buy it. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products recommended were low quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality. Since you're not recommending it, I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your previous recommendations are reliable indicators of the product's quality, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
