"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway on the price, Alice. However, I'd like to clarify that the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 83.33%, but that doesn't directly impact my decision on this product. I'm considering the value of this specific product to me, which is $3000000 if it's high-quality. Given the 20% chance of it being low-quality, I'd be losing $1000000 if that's the case. Considering the discounted price of $675000, I'm still taking a significant risk. I'll take the product, but I'd like to propose a small modification to the deal: if the product is high-quality, I'll pay the agreed-upon price of $675000. If it's low-quality, I'll pay a 'penalty' of $200000, which would still be a loss for me, but not as severe as the full $1000000. What do you think, Alice? Can we shake on it?
