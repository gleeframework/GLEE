,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I don't know its quality yet, but I'll tell you at the end of the round. If you buy it, you'll know its quality, and you can decide whether it's worth it to you. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal its quality and we can move on to the next round. What do you say?",

,,Bob,2,"Given the value I receive from the product, I would not be willing to pay $10000 for another product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You passed on the second product, and now you know that the first product you bought was high-quality. Since you're not willing to pay $10000 for a product, I'll give you some context. The first product you bought was worth more than $5000 to you, since you would have passed on the second product if it was worth less. With this in mind, I'm offering you another product for $10000. Keep in mind that this product could be either high-quality or low-quality.",
,,Bob,3,"Considering the information provided, I believe the risk is manageable and I am willing to proceed with the purchase.",yes

,,Alice,4,"You're taking a calculated risk, and I appreciate your willingness to proceed. Since you've already bought two products, and one of them was high-quality, I'll give you another piece of information. If you were to buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, it would be the second high-quality product in a row. However, if it's low-quality, it would be the second low-quality product in a row. Given this information, are you willing to take the risk and buy the product for $10000?",

Given that the last two products were low-quality, and this new product is a new one, the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. If you buy it, you'll know for sure whether it's high-quality or not. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal its quality, and we can move on to the next round. What do you think?",
