low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product and there are no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer also passed, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 1. This suggests that the products being sold may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has recommended 3 products to other buyers, none of which were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to pass on this product and hope to get a better recommendation or, ideally, get a high-quality product directly."
