low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to get a baseline for the probability of the product being high quality based on the lack of sales history."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the recommendation is based on incomplete information and the lack of sold high-quality products so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high-quality, as Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been 2 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, which might suggest a low-quality product. However, I'd like to take the risk and buy it, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received the same recommendation and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product and wasting my money. I'd rather pass and wait for more information or a different recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if you're not recommending it, it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, and only 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the previous 4 buyers were likely given low-quality products, which led to them not buying. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'd like to see the next product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products to buyers who accept the recommendation. I'd rather wait for more information or make my own decision without Alice's influence."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold before I make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation is not a good indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it less likely that this product is high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers, who received a recommendation to buy, purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
