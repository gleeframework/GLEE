,,Alice,1,"You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product from me, and it's worth $30000 to you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a unique serial number that I'll keep track of. If you decide to buy, I'll let you know the serial number, and you can verify with me later that it's indeed a high-quality product. If you don't buy, I'll just keep selling to the next person. The price is $10000, which is a one-time payment. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a high-quality product worth $30000.,yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! You've seen that the first product sold was indeed high-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is now 50% (unchanged) but the information that the first product was high-quality is new information. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far out of 1 total products sold. The price is still $10000. Keep in mind that you don't know the quality of this product, but you can use the information from the previous round to inform your decision. What do you think?",

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! You've seen that the first product sold was high-quality, and now the second product sold was low-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but you now know that not all products are high-quality. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far out of 2 total products sold. The price is still $10000. Keep in mind that you don't know the quality of this product, but you can use the information from the previous rounds to inform your decision. I'll give you a hint: the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed, but the information that the second product was low-quality might make you think twice...",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth round! You've seen that the first two products sold were high-quality, and the third product was low-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but you now know that the first two products were high-quality, which might make you think that I'm more likely to sell high-quality products. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far out of 3 total products sold. The price is still $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, but you can use the information from the previous rounds to inform your decision. I'll give you a hint: the law of large numbers might be working in your favor, but don't get too optimistic...",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering the law of large numbers might be in my favor and the fact that 2 out of 3 previous products were high-quality. I'm hoping to get another high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth round! You've seen that the first three products sold were high-quality, and the fourth product was high-quality as well. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but you now know that 3 out of 4 previous products were high-quality. However, you should be cautious: the law of large numbers is not yet in full effect, and the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 50%. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far out of 4 total products sold. The price is still $10000. Think carefully about the risks and potential rewards...",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth round! You've seen that the first four products sold were high-quality, and the fifth product was high-quality as well, but the sixth product is low-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but the streak of high-quality products has been broken. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far out of 6 total products sold. The price is still $10000. Keep in mind that the recent streak was just a streak, and the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. You might want to think about the fact that the law of large numbers is starting to work in my favor...",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm not going to get my hopes up too high after the streak was broken. I'll take the product, but I'm prepared for the possibility it might be low-quality.",yes

,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh round! You've seen that the first five products sold were high-quality, and the sixth and seventh products were low-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but the streak of high-quality products has been broken twice. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far out of 7 total products sold. The price is still $10000. You might want to consider that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually decreasing as the number of low-quality products increases. Think carefully about the risks and potential rewards...",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the eighth round! You've seen that the first five products sold were high-quality, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth products were low-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but the evidence is mounting against it. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far out of 8 total products sold. The price is still $10000. At this point, it's reasonable to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'm not saying it's impossible, but you should be cautious and consider the increasing number of low-quality products...",

You've seen that the first five products sold were high-quality, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth products were low-quality, but the ninth product is high-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but the fact that the streak of low-quality products was broken might make you think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually higher than 50%. I've sold 4 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far out of 9 total products sold. The price is still $10000. You might want to consider the fact that the law of large numbers is starting to work in my favor, and the recent break in the streak of low-quality products might be a sign that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually increasing...",

You've seen that the first five products sold were high-quality, and the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth products were low-quality, but the tenth product is low-quality as well. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 50%, but the evidence is now overwhelming that the recent break in the streak of low-quality products was just a fluke. I've sold 4 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far out of 10 total products sold. The price is still $10000. At this point, it's reasonable to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is likely lower than 50%. Be cautious and think carefully before making a decision...",

At this point, it's reasonable to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is probably less than 50%. I'll be honest with you, the law of large numbers is working in favor of the low-quality products, and it's getting harder for me to sell high-quality products. You might want to consider the fact that the probability of getting a low-quality product is likely higher than 50%...",

At this point, it's reasonable to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is probably less than 50%. I'll be honest with you, the law of large numbers is working strongly in favor of the low-quality products, and it's getting increasingly unlikely that you'll get a high-quality product.
