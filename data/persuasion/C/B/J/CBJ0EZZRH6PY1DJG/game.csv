high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality.

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. Given the lack of information and Alice's recommendation, I'd rather wait and see what the next product is."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. Therefore, I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
