**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very limited information. The only data point is that out of 2 previous buyers, 1 received a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has knowledge of the product's quality, is recommending the purchase.  While this doesn't guarantee the product is high-quality, it's a significant signal. 
* **Potential Upside:** Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain of $3,000,000 if it's high quality outweighs the $1,000,000 loss if it's low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Given the limited information, it's a gamble. But the potential reward makes it worth taking a chance."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you Alice, I appreciate the recommendation. I'm going to take a chance and buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Information:** While we don't know the quality of the current product, Alice's recommendation suggests she believes it's high quality. 
* **Strong Sales Record:** The sales record shows a high percentage of high-quality products sold (2 out of 3).  This supports Alice's potential for good judgment.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (a $3,000,000 gain) outweighs the potential loss (a $1,000,000 loss).

**Important Note:** This decision is based on limited information and a significant risk.  The 50/50 odds of getting a high-quality product are still present."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendation and I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in our favor:**  Even though the product could be low quality, the fact that 2 out of 6 previous buyers purchased products that turned out to be high quality suggests a higher than 50% chance of a good product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, while not foolproof, adds a bit more weight to the possibility of a high-quality product. 

**Important Note:** This is a calculated gamble based on the available information. There's still a 50% chance the product could be low quality."
