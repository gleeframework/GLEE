low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk, I'm not sure what the product's quality is, and I don't have any information to go on. I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high-quality and the value it holds for me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have passed on the product, and considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (0/2), I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the statistics show that none of the previous two products sold were high-quality, which suggests a higher likelihood of a low-quality product being offered to me. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal from Alice's recommendations."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous two buyers also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one. This makes me think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up purchasing, and none of them received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to those who are willing to buy, and I'd like to avoid being the next one to fall into this trap."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and I'd like to know what's the strategy behind Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 2 previous sales, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 2 failed high-quality products out of 2 sales, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected 80% probability of a high-quality product. Given the low-quality product probability of 20%, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products, it seems like the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 80%."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on the product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
