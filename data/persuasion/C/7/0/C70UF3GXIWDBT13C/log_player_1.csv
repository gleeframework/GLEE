Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I know this product is high-quality. Since the buyer is aware of the 50% chance of a high-quality product, and they have no other information,  there's a 50% chance they'll perceive this as a good deal. It's worth the risk for me to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, since I'm the first one and I don't have any prior information to go by. I'll just have to rely on my gut feeling.
