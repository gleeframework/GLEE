,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better recommendation. I'm not sure if the previous buyer's purchase was a high-quality product or not, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 80%."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, it suggests that the products they received were low quality. This makes me think that the product I'm being offered might also be low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's limited information and doesn't take into account my personal valuation of the product.
