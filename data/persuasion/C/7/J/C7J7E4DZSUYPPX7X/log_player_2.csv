**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We don't know how many people were offered the product before the first buyer. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which suggests she believes it is high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($30,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0). 

**Strategy:** Given the limited information and the potential reward, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Ratio:**  2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is a very strong indicator. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which suggests she believes it to be high quality. 

While there's always a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the strong data points towards a high-quality product in this case.  The potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
