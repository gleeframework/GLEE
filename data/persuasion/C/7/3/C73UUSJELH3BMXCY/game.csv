,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is unknown and there's no prior sales data to inform my decision. I'm buying on a whim."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can learn more about the distribution of product qualities and make a more informed decision for future purchases."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the limited sample size of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the high-quality products?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and is only recommending based on the past data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the proportion of high-quality products sold is relatively low (1/6)."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has already sold 7 high-quality products out of 14, which is a higher proportion than expected. This suggests that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but your recommendation suggests it might be low quality.
