,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the products being recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 4 buyers purchased a high-quality product.

I'd like to pass on the current product and see if I can get a better deal or gain more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for a different product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is 0.00% and the recommendation is based on unknown information. I'd like to wait for more data to make an informed decision."
