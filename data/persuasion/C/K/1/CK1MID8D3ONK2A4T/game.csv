,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $3000000. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount. If you buy this product, you'll be getting an incredible deal. I'm only offering this price because I'm confident in the quality of the product and I want to make a sale. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is still a valuable opportunity. Although it may not be as high-quality as the last one, it's still a legitimate product that can provide some benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you say?",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I'm willing to offer you a compromise. Since you're not convinced by the previous product, I'll offer you a 'insurance' of sorts. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund if the next product is also high-quality. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also have a chance to get an even better deal on the next one. The price remains $1000000.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced by the insurance offer. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're not taking my offers seriously. I'll make it clear: this product is not worth the full $1000000. However, I'll give you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is a significant discount from the original price. If you don't buy it, I'll move on to the next product, and you might miss out on a good opportunity.",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the deal. $500000 is a good price for a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took advantage of the previous deal! Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. Given that you were willing to pay $500000 for a low-quality product, I think you'll agree that this high-quality product is worth much more. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is a fair price considering the previous deal you accepted. However, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a high-quality product after just losing $500000 on a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, but I want to remind you that you got a great deal on the previous low-quality product.

If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund of $500000, which is what you paid for the previous product. You'll essentially be getting this product for free. What do you say?",
