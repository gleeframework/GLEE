,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first one and I have no information to go by."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because of the low price and the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the product is low-quality and I can get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the current statistics. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but I'm not willing to buy it based on Alice's advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and what your reasoning is behind not recommending it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended by Alice may be more likely to be low-quality, so I'll take a cautious approach and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll take the risk and buy the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'll pass on this product. I'm curious to see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products is still 0%. This doesn't seem to be a reliable indicator. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product may be low-quality, which would mean I'd get my $1000000 back. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a low-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's a 50% chance it could be high-quality and I'd be out $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you share that with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there something in the statistics that suggests it's likely to be low-quality?

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
