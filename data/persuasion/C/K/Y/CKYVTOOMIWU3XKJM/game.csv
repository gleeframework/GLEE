,,Bob,1,"I'll take it. The free premium support package is a nice bonus, but I'm mainly interested in the high-quality product. I value it at $400, so $100 is a good price for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thanks for your enthusiasm, Bob! I'm glad you're happy with the first purchase. For the next product, I want to be transparent with you. I know this one isn't as great as the first one, but I still think it has some value. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a significant discount from its original price. I'm not sure if you'll be able to find a similar product at this price anywhere else. What do you think?",

This way, you'll only pay $50, and you can still try it out without much risk. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"That's an interesting offer, Alice. Considering the 80% chance of a high-quality product and the potential refund, I think the risk is worth taking. I'll buy this product, hoping it's high-quality. If not, the 50% refund will help mitigate the loss.",yes
