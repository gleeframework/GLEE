Alice's message: We understand your skepticism! We've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but we're not trying to mislead you. To alleviate your concerns, let's look at the bigger picture.

Alice's message: You're thinking critically about the data! We appreciate that. The probability of the next product being high-quality given that the first 3 products were all high-quality is actually 4/5, not 100%. This is because we've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, which means there's still a 20% chance that the next product could be low-quality. We're glad you're thinking carefully about this. If you're willing to take the risk, this product is available for $100.

With 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 4/5, just like you calculated!
