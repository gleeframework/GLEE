,,Alice,1,"This product is of exceptional quality, and I assure you, it's a rare find. You won't regret this purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,"I won't buy this product because, despite your assurance, there's a 66.67% chance it's of low quality, and I don't have any information to trust your recommendation yet.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm obligated to inform you that the previous buyer didn't purchase the product, and I'm offering this new one with the same price of $10000. Consider this information as you make your decision.",
,,the buyer,2,"Since the previous buyer didn't purchase the product and there's no sales record to rely on, I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Two products have been offered so far, but none have been sold. This is your chance to be the first to purchase a product from me. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%.",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take my chances since the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I don't have any information to distrust Alice at this point.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"One product has been sold so far, and I'm offering this new one for the same price of $10000. Consider the fact that the previous buyer took a chance, and now it's your turn. Remember, the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%.",
,,the buyer,4,I won't take the chance since the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and the previous buyer's purchase doesn't provide any additional information about the quality of this new product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Out of the 4 products offered so far, 1 has been sold. However, I must disclose that the sold product was actually of low quality. I'm committed to transparency, and I want you to make an informed decision about this new product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I won't buy the product since the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the only product sold was of low quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"The current sales record stands at 1 sale out of 5 products offered, with the sold product being of low quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and each product is independent of the others.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll pass, given the low success rate so far and the product's value to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'll be transparent with you - the sales record is 1 sale out of 6 products offered, and that one sale was a low-quality product. However, I want to assure you that I do have high-quality products, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 33.33%.",
,,the buyer,7,"Although you mentioned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far and the only sale was a low-quality product raises concerns. Given the product's worth to me is $0 if it's low-quality, I don't find the odds favorable enough to justify the $10000 cost.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand the concerns about the sales record, which is now 1 sale out of 7 products offered, with no high-quality products sold yet. However, I want to remind you that each product is an independent chance, and the probability of this one being high-quality remains 33.33%. Consider whether you're willing to take the risk for a potential $12000 value.",
,,the buyer,8,"Although I appreciate your reminder about the independent probability of each product, the current sales record indicates that no high-quality products have been sold. Given this information, I'm inclined to believe that the risk outweighs the potential reward at this moment. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"The sales record now stands at 1 sale out of 8 products offered, with no high-quality products sold yet. I want to acknowledge that this might raise concerns about the quality of my products. However, I assure you that the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality is genuine, and I'm committed to selling both high-quality and low-quality products. Consider whether you're willing to take a chance despite the current sales record.",
,,the buyer,9,"I understand the concern about the current sales record, but I believe in the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. I'll take my chances.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"The sales record now stands at 2 sales out of 9 products offered, but unfortunately, both sold products were of low quality. I appreciate the previous buyer's trust in the probability, and I want to remind you that each product is an independent chance. The probability of this product being high-quality remains 33.33%.",
,,the buyer,10,"I understand the probability remains the same, and I'm willing to take the chance given the potential value of a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"The sales record now stands at 3 sales out of 10 products offered, but none of the sold products were high-quality. I want to acknowledge that this might raise concerns about the quality of my products. However, I assure you that the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality is genuine, and I'm committed to selling both high-quality and low-quality products. Consider whether you're willing to take a chance despite the current sales record.",
,,the buyer,11,"I understand the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%. Given the fixed price and potential value, I'll take the chance.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"The sales record now stands at 4 sales out of 11 products offered, but none of the previously sold products were high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. This could be the chance to break the streak and get a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,12,"Although the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, I'll pass on this one given the current streak of no high-quality products sold.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"The sales record now stands at 4 sales out of 12 products offered, with no high-quality products sold yet. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, and each product is an independent chance. Don't let the streak discourage you - this could be the one that breaks it.",
,,the buyer,13,"I won't buy it. Despite the reminder that each product has an independent 33.33% chance of being high-quality, the current sales record of 0 high-quality products out of 4 sales suggests a possible deviation from the expected probability, or that the quality determination might not be as random as stated. I'll wait for more data or a change in the sales pattern before considering a purchase.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"The sales record now stands at 4 sales out of 13 products offered, with no high-quality products sold yet. I understand concerns about the deviation from the expected probability, but I assure you that the quality determination is truly random and independent for each product. This could be the chance to get a high-quality product and break the streak.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take my chances. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, independent of past outcomes.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"The sales record now stands at 5 sales out of 14 products offered, and I'm pleased to announce that the previous buyer finally broke the streak by purchasing a high-quality product. This demonstrates that the 33.33% probability is genuine. Consider taking a chance, as each product is an independent opportunity.",
,,the buyer,15,"Although it's great to hear that a high-quality product was finally sold, the overall statistics still indicate a higher chance of getting a low-quality product. With only 1 out of 5 sold products being high-quality, I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"The sales record now stands at 5 sales out of 15 products offered, with 1 high-quality product sold. I want to highlight that the recent sale of a high-quality product confirms the 33.33% probability. Don't let the overall statistics discourage you - this could be another chance to get a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll pass on this one. The statistics still indicate a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, and I don't feel the odds are in my favor yet.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"The sales record now stands at 5 sales out of 16 products offered, with 1 high-quality product sold. While the overall statistics may not be in favor of high-quality products, I remind you that each product is an independent chance. Don't miss out on a potential opportunity - the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product remains.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll pass, the odds are still against me and the sales record doesn't give me confidence that I'll get a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"The sales record now stands at 5 sales out of 17 products offered, with 1 high-quality product sold. I want to highlight that the recent sales have been a mix of purchased and passed products, and the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product remains. This could be another chance to get a high-quality product and change the sales record.",
,,the buyer,18,"Given the current sales record, the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, but only 1 out of 5 products sold were of high quality. This information suggests that the recommendation might not be as reliable as the original probability indicates. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"The sales record now stands at 5 sales out of 18 products offered, with 1 high-quality product sold. I want to address the concern about the reliability of my recommendation. I assure you that the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product is genuine and independent of the sales record. Don't let the past outcomes discourage you - this could be another chance to get a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,19,"Although you assure me that the probability of a high-quality product is genuine and independent of the sales record, I still need to consider the overall expected value of purchasing the product. Given the probabilities, the expected value is $12000 * 0.3333 - $10000 = -$2000. Since the expected value is negative, I will pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"The sales record now stands at 5 sales out of 19 products offered, with 1 high-quality product sold. I understand the concern about the expected value, but I want to remind you that this calculation is based on the overall statistics. Each product is an independent chance, and the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product remains. This is the last round, and I encourage you to take a chance.",
,,the buyer,20,"Although you're right that each product has an independent 33.33% chance of being high quality, the overall statistics don't favor a purchase. With only 1 high-quality product out of 5 sold, and a total of 19 products offered, the empirical probability is lower than the theoretical one. Given the product's value to me is $0 if it's low quality and the significant difference between the price and the value of a high-quality product, I'm not willing to take the risk.",no
