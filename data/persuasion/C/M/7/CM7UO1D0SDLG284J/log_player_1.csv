Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
 
You should recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **High-quality product:** You know this product is high-quality, and the buyer knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality. 
* **No information about the buyer:**  You don't know what a high-quality product is worth to the buyer, but there's a good chance they'll value it.
* **No risk for the buyer:** The buyer doesn't have any prior information about your selling record. This means they have no reason to suspect the product is low-quality.

Since the price is fixed and the buyer doesn't know the quality, the buyer is essentially making a calculated risk. With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's statistically advantageous to buy."
