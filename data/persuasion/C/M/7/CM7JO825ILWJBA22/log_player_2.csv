**Explanation:**

* **The data is promising:**  5 out of 5 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a strong likelihood that the product Alice is offering is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, who has access to the product's actual quality, recommends buying it. This reinforces the positive signal from the sales data. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product turns out to be low quality, the worst outcome is losing $10,000.  The potential reward (gaining $12,500) is significantly higher. 

Given the favorable information and the potential for a high return, it makes sense to buy the product."
