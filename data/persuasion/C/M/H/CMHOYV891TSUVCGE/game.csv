,,Alice,4,"I understand you're holding out for a high-quality product. I want to be transparent with you - I've already offered you two low-quality products at discounted prices. If I were to sell this one to you, I'd be selling it at a loss, and it wouldn't be a good value for either of us. I'm willing to give you a final chance to pass on it for $700000. If you decline, I'll move on to the next round with a new product.",

I'll make one final offer on this product for $400000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not expecting you to accept it.
