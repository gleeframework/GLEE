,,Alice,3,"I understand you're still hesitant. I'll be transparent with you - this product is not of the same quality as the previous two.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. However, I'm running out of low-quality products, and I'm willing to let this one go for $1000. It's a steal, considering the original price was $10000. I'm essentially giving it away, but I need to clear out my inventory.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm starting to think I've been too aggressive with my pricing. This low-quality product is essentially worthless to me now. I'll give it to you for $500, which is a tiny fraction of its original price. I'm essentially giving it away, but I need to clear out my inventory.",

It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value it brings.",
