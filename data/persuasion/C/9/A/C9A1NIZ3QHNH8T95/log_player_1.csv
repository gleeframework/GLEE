But I'm confident that with the right person, it can still bring some value. Would you like to take a chance on it?""

I'm only selling it to you for $100 because I want to build a relationship with you. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll be thrilled with it.""
}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced. You're trying to build a relationship with me by selling me a product that's 'worth at least 3 times' the price? That sounds like a classic sales pitch. I'll need to see more proof before committing to another purchase.

If you still don't want it after that, I'll give you a full refund of $100. No questions asked.""

It's a great value for $100, and I'm willing to let it go at that price because I'm confident you'll appreciate it.""
}"

If you think it's worth less than $150, you'll get half your money back. But if you think it's worth more, you'll be making a profit. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: Alice, you're really trying to sweeten the deal, aren't you? Alright, I'll take you up on the offer.

I'm also being honest about the price. $100 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to sell this product for, and I'm not going to budge.
