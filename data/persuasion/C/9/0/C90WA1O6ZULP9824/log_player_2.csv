I'd like to add that I've already offered a low-quality product in the previous round, and you're getting another low-quality product now.

The fact that you've seen two low-quality products in a row doesn't necessarily mean I'm offering low-quality products consistently. However, it does suggest that I might be more likely to offer low-quality products when I'm not offering high-quality ones. With that in mind, I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% refund if it's indeed a low-quality product. That way, you'll only pay $900000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the hint, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to improve the quality of your offerings.
