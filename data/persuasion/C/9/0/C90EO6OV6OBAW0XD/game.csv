,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's worth $4000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the statistics. I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 4 out of 4 previous buyers being recommended to buy and none of them purchasing a high-quality product, it seems like the products recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. It seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm assuming that since you've recommended against it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, but I'll still take a shot at getting the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if Alice is recommending not to buy, it's likely a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next one and see if I can get a better indication of its quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
