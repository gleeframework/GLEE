But let me ask you, have you considered that the products I've been selling might be a random sample of the entire population? Maybe the high-quality products I've sold so far are just a fluke, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually much lower.

Alice's message: Well, it looks like you're a statistician at heart! You're absolutely right that the probability of a product being high-quality is 25% and the probability of a product being low-quality is 75%.

With 4 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 44.44%.
