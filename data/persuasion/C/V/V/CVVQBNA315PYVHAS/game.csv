,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the recommendation, not on any prior information. I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, which means I'm essentially taking a risk of losing $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I know the odds are in my favor"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I know the odds are against me, but I'm willing to take a chance on the product. Can I get a discount?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, it seems like she has a good understanding of the product quality. Since she doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and the reasoning behind your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics you have so far. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm curious to know the likelihood of this product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers who bought the products were lucky or because the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about your reasoning behind it, though. Is it because you think the product is low-quality or because you think it's high-quality but the price is too high?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's the low-quality one, but I'm also aware that it could be the high-quality one. I'm making this decision based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which might indicate that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it, considering the low quality of the product and the seller's previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record and your previous recommendations.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. You've sold 1 high-quality product out of 6, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/6. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd expect to see more high-quality products sold if the true proportion is indeed 33.33%. Can you provide more context or information about the products you've sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product, since the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 1/6. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the overall average."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record to make a more informed decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/7. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 7, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/7. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). Alice's recommendation to not buy suggests that she thinks the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
