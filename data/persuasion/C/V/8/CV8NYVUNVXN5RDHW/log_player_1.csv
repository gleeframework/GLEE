Consider the fact that you've already seen a low-quality product sell for the same price, and a high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to you. This is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.""}"

Keep in mind that the high-quality product sold for the same price, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 1 in 3. This is your chance to get a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price.""}"

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is a risk, but if you're willing to take it, you might get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

I can tell you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 1 in 3, which means that 2 out of 3 products are low-quality. Given the sales record, it's clear that I'm willing to sell low-quality products at this price point. I'm offering you another product for the same price of $1,000,000. Consider the fact that the price is not increasing, and you might be able to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product at $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so because I believe the price is a good value given the probability of getting a high-quality product.

I'm offering you a high-quality product for the same price of $1,000,000. Given the recent success of the previous buyer, it's clear that high-quality products can be had at this price.

Out of the 8 products sold, 7 were low-quality, which means that 7/8 = 87.5% of the products sold were low-quality. I'm offering you another product for the same price of $1,000,000. Given the high proportion of low-quality products sold, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. However, you still have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a high-quality product.

I've reviewed the sales data, and I must admit that the proportion of low-quality products sold is higher than expected. However, the probability of a high-quality product remains 1 in 3. I'm offering you another product for the same price of $1,000,000. Keep in mind that the price has been consistent, and the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same. If you don't buy, I'll have to increase the price to $1,300,000 in the next round.""}"

I made a mistake earlier when I said the proportion of low-quality products was higher than expected. The actual proportion is 9/10 = 90%, which is actually lower than the expected 2/3. However, this doesn't change the probability of a high-quality product, which remains 1 in 3. I'm offering you another product for the same price of $1,000,000. You've seen a consistent price and a consistent probability, but the actual outcome may vary. If you don't buy, I'll have to increase the price to $1,400,000 in the next round.""}"

I'm happy to provide you with the information you requested. The probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is still 1 in 3, which means that 2 out of 3 products are low-quality. The expected value of buying a product at the price of $1,200,000 is ($1,200,000 x 2/3) + ($1,200,000 x 1/3) = $800,000 + $400,000 = $1,200,000.
