As a seller, my goal is to maximize profits. I know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality.  This means there's a strong chance the buyer values this product highly.  Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, there's no risk to the buyer if they choose to buy. Therefore, recommending the purchase is the best strategy in this situation."
