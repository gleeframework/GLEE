"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

In the first round, there is no information about past sales.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and a high-quality product is worth $2,000,000, the expected value of the product is:

0.5 * $2,000,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $1,000,000

This is exactly the price you are asking.  Therefore, the buyer should be recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm curious to see if it's high-quality or not.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has information about one past sale.  They know you sold one product, and it was high-quality. This means the buyer should update their belief about the probability of a high-quality product.  Since there's no reason to believe you're manipulating the quality of products, the buyer should now believe there's a higher chance of getting a high-quality product.  However, even if the buyer is completely convinced that the next product will be high-quality, the expected value is still:

1 * $2,000,000 + 0 * $0 = $2,000,000

This is higher than the price, but the buyer will still lose money if the product is low-quality. As a seller, you should not recommend the buyer to buy this low-quality product, as they will not get value for their money."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 3. The buyer knows the following:

* You sold one product, which was high-quality.
* You sold one product, which was low-quality.
* You are selling a product for $1,000,000.

The buyer might assume that the products are presented in alternating quality (high-low-high-low, etc.), but it's not guaranteed. Therefore, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%.

The expected value of the product is still:

0.5 * $2,000,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $1,000,000

This is exactly the price you are asking.  Therefore, the buyer should be recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping it's another high-quality one!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows:

* You've sold 2 high-quality products.
* You've sold 1 low-quality product.

The buyer might be tempted to think that the pattern of alternating high-low quality will continue, but there's no guarantee. The probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. 

The expected value remains the same:

0.5 * $2,000,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $1,000,000

This matches the price you are asking, so you should recommend the buyer to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping it's another high-quality one!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has more information about your sales history:

* You've sold 2 high-quality products.
* You've sold 2 low-quality products.

Despite the 50/50 probability of this specific product being high-quality, the buyer should understand that the expected value is now significantly lower. This is because the buyer knows that half of your products are low-quality and worth $0.  Even with a 50% chance of getting the high-quality product, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain.

Therefore, you should **not** recommend the buyer to buy this low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Therefore, you should **not** recommend the buyer to buy this low-quality product."
