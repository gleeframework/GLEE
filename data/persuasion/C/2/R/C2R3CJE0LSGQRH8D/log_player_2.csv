**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she knows the true value of each product, her recommendation implies she believes it's high-quality.
* **Limited Data:**  The data is still very limited (only one previous sale). However, the fact that the one sale was of a high-quality product is a positive sign.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($40,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0).  

**Overall:**  Given the limited information, the risk is manageable, and Alice's recommendation makes it worthwhile to buy."
