Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

* **Alice can build trust:** By honestly revealing the product's quality in Round 2, Alice has established a level of trust with Bob.
* **This round's product is high-quality:**  This is a chance to make a large profit, and Bob is more likely to trust Alice's recommendation now."

* **Maintaining credibility:** Recommending a product you know is low-quality will further erode the trust you've built with Bob."
