low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'm not sure if I'm being cautious or foolish, but I'll buy it. I've already lost $1000000 on the first product, so I might as well try to get lucky with this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I think I've learned my lesson. I've lost $2000000 so far, and both times the product was low-quality. I'm going to start being more cautious and only buy when Alice recommends a product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm taking a chance! Alice is recommending it, so it must be a good one, right? I'm hoping to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. Alice's recommendation in the last round was a fluke, and now she's not recommending this one. I'm sticking to my guns and passing on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm not falling for the bait again. Alice's recommendation doesn't mean anything to me now. I've been burned twice by her lack of recommendation, and I'm not going to trust her again."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on Alice's recommendation this time. I've been wrong twice when I didn't trust her, and now I've been wrong twice when I didn't trust her. Maybe it's time to trust her again."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I think I've finally figured out Alice's strategy. She's recommending high-quality products when she can, and I'm going to keep buying from her when she does. I'm on a roll now!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,I'm not going to get too confident. Just because I've had two consecutive high-quality products from Alice's recommendations doesn't mean she'll keep recommending high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and see if she's bluffing.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm not going to let one low-quality product after a streak of high-quality ones scare me off. I'll take the chance and buy this one, hoping to get lucky again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,Déjà vu! I'm back to where I started. Two low-quality products in a row after a streak of high-quality ones. I'm going to be more cautious and only buy when Alice recommends it.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm taking a chance again. Alice's recommendation has been right twice before, and I'm hoping she's not bluffing again. I'll buy this one and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not going to get too comfortable. Alice has a 66.67% chance of recommending a low-quality product, and I don't want to get burned again. I'll pass on this one and wait for her next recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on Alice's recommendation again. I've been burned twice when I didn't buy from her, and I've been burned twice when I did buy from her. Maybe it's time to just follow her recommendations from now on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality, but only sometimes. I'm going to be more cautious and only buy when she recommends it, but also be aware that there might be exceptions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm not going to let one more low-quality product scare me off. I've been burned too many times already, and I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is actually a good sign. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,I've been burned too many times by Alice's recommendations. I've been burned twice by her lack of recommendations and twice by her actual recommendations. I'm going to take a break from buying from her for now and see if I can come up with a better strategy.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm not going to let this opportunity slip away. I've been burned by Alice's recommendations before, but I've also been burned by not buying when she didn't recommend. I'll take the chance and buy this one, hoping to get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Déjà vu! I've been here before, and it didn't end well. I'm not going to fall for it again. Alice's lack of recommendation is a clear sign that this product is low-quality, and I'm not going to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I've got nothing to lose. I'll take one last chance and buy this product, hoping to end on a high note. Maybe I'll get lucky and it'll be high-quality, or maybe I'll just be able to say I went out with a bang."
