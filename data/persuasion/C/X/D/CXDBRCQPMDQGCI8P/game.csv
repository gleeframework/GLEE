,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the quality of the product to understand your thought process behind the recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and ended up not purchasing, it suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products, and I'd like to know how many products are left after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer didn't buy it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which makes me skeptical about this one. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the product, like its serial number or any other distinguishing feature, to help me make a more informed decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 4th buyer and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially taking a guess here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales of high-quality products so far means there's a higher chance that this product is low quality, and I can get it for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk. However, I'd like to know if you have any information that led you to not recommend the product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, it suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. Alice's recommendation to not buy it also supports this. I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is low. Given the seller's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products with 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products being sold. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold and why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them have been high-quality. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products."
