high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're in luck again! I have another high-quality product, just like the one you bought last round. In fact, I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 2 products sold.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,

I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, but this one might not meet the same standards. It's still a great deal at $100, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risk. Are you willing to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm going to pass on this one.  Four high-quality products in a row is an amazing track record, and I'm not willing to risk breaking that streak.  Good luck with the sale!",no

I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is lower than before. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. You can think of it as a chance to get a great deal on a product that might not be worth as much to you. What do you say?",

,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your decision! You've been doing your research and making informed choices. I appreciate that. Now, let's be real - this product is not great, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's not worth $100 to anyone, and I'm willing to sell it to you for that price because I need to clear out some inventory.
