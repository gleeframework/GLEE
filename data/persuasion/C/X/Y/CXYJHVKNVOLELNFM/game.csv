,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since two previous buyers have already bought the products after her recommendations, and none of them were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the previous sales data and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that none have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality, but I also know that there's a 33.33% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the sales record and how you determined not to recommend it?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, and the fact that you recommended it, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm willing to take the risk, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality might be higher than 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 5 out of 5 products recommended were low quality, I suspect Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass and see if you would recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that you're trying to get rid of the product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality one, and based on the previous sales record, it seems like none of the previous buyers got a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 6 buyers, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity to buy."
