,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! With over 50% of my products being high-quality, I'm confident that this one is a gem. I've had a great track record of satisfied customers, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you for a flat $10000. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this potentially amazing product?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take a chance on your product, but I'd like to clarify that I'll only pay $1000 if it's a low-quality product, and $40000 if it's a high-quality product. If it's not a high-quality product, I'll take the product and sell it for $0, which will make it a great deal for me.",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my store! I'm glad to see another buyer interested in my products.

I'll sell it to you for $12000, which is a steal considering its exceptional quality. What do you think? Will you take advantage of this amazing deal?",
