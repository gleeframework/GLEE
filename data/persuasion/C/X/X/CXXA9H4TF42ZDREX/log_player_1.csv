I don't have a strategy for selecting products, I simply offer them to you as I receive them. The fact that I've had a high success rate so far is just a coincidence. I'm not trying to manipulate you or influence your decision in any way. I'm offering you this product for $10,000, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. However, I want to point out that if my previous high-quality products were just a fluke, then I should have sold a low-quality product by now. Since I haven't, it's possible that my products are indeed high-quality. What do you think?""}"

This is highly unlikely, and I think it's possible that I've been selling low-quality products all along. I'm willing to offer you a chance to take a closer look at my sales record. If you buy this product, I'll give you access to my sales data from all 10 rounds, and you can make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase. What do you think?""}"
