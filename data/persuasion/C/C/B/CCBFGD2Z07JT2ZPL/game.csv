low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing this based on the fact that there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm essentially a neutral, uninformed buyer at this point."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to decline based on the recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience. Was the product they bought high-quality or low-quality?"

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, as the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the gamble."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. This is higher than the overall probability of a product being low quality (20%). I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were also recommended to buy, but both products turned out to be low quality.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products recommended by Alice and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to make my own decision based on the probabilities."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me."
