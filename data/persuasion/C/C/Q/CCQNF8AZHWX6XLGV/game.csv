high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I understand your hesitation. Given the current sales record, I can see why you might be skeptical. However, I assure you that this product is high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'd be happy to sell it to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is slightly lower than expected. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the low number of sales and the fact that she knows my valuation of the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only 2 high-quality products out of 4 sold, I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. With 9 high-quality products sold out of 12 total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. I'm willing to offer you a discount to make the deal more attractive: $950000 for this high-quality product."
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 4 buyers purchased the product, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/4 = 0.5. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and Alice recommends buying, it seems suspicious. I'll pass on the product to see if Alice's recommendation is reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/4 = 0.5. This is consistent with the expected probability of 0.5, so I'm not getting any additional information from the previous sales. Given that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to trust her assessment and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation is not in my favor, so I will pass on it."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, and given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far, I'm skeptical about the chances of this one being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you trying to protect me from a low-quality product or is there something else I should consider?
