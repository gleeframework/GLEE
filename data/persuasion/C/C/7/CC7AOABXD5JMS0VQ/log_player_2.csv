Round 2
Alice's message: I have another high-quality product available for $100. However, I want to let you know that you just bought a high-quality product from me in the previous round, so I'm curious to know if you think this one is also worth $100 to you. Would you like to purchase it?

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I want to offer you a chance to compare this new high-quality product to the one you already bought. Would you like to purchase this one for $100, and I'll let you keep both products to compare them side-by-side?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product for $100, even if I can compare it to the one I already bought. I don't see any benefit in buying two products that are worth the same to me.""}"

I'd like to offer you a'satisfaction guarantee': if you buy this product and don't think it's worth the price, I'll give you a chance to return it for a full refund, and we can discuss a potential discount on a future purchase. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking the risk, even with the satisfaction guarantee.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator! I'll try a different approach. I'll let you in on a secret: I have a limited number of high-quality products left, and I'm getting worried that I won't be able to sell them at the original price. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll throw in a 'golden ticket' - a chance to buy one of the high-quality products at the original price of $100, whenever I sell the next one. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100, with the potential to get a high-quality one at the original price later?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, even with the promise of a potential high-quality product at the original price later.

If you buy this product, you'll essentially be getting the next high-quality product for $50. Is that a deal you'd be willing to take?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a voucher for a discount on the next high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to be offered directly, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting another low-quality product.""}"

You'll get a total of 5 low-quality products for $20 each. Would you like to take the lot?
