If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll throw in a 'golden ticket' - a chance to buy one of the high-quality products at the original price of $100, whenever I sell the next one. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100, with the potential to get a high-quality one at the original price later?""
