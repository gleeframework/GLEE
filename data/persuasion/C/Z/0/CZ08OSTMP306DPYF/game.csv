low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to pass on the opportunity to purchase it. I'm not relying on Alice's recommendation, though."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that the product might be low-quality, and I'd like to wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to pass on the product, and none of them have purchased it. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average, making it more likely that this product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'll pass. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you haven't recommended it, which suggests the probability of it being high-quality might be low, but I still want to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would confirm my suspicion that your recommendations are based on the product quality, and I can update my probability of the product being high-quality accordingly."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that 9 out of 9 previous buyers bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 9 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I'm assuming that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 10 buyers all received low-quality products, suggesting that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
