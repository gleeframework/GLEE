high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a steal! It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd love to take the offer, but I'll only buy if I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in making a deal. However, I must correct you - I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and neither do you. But I can tell you that the previous buyer who bought from me is now gone, and I'm starting from a clean slate. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, a fair price considering the risk you're taking. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you some information to consider. Since I've sold 2 products so far, and you know that the first one was high-quality, the probability of the second product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I can offer you a different perspective. Think about it this way: if I was trying to sell you a low-quality product, I would have sold it to the previous buyer, who was willing to take the risk. But I didn't, so this product must be the low-quality one. It's a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price of $10000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your reasoning, Alice. I think you're trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect that. Let me give you a straightforward message. I've sold 2 products so far, and neither of them has been sold to you. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll be upfront with you - I'm not trying to manipulate you. I'm just trying to make a sale. And I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a fair price, considering the risk you're taking. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance and made a purchase! I've now sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 66.67%. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a bold one, aren't you? Alright, I'll give you the numbers. I've sold 4 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll let you in on a little secret: the previous buyer who bought from me just left, and they're not coming back. That means I'm starting from a clean slate again. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're a high-quality connoisseur! I've sold 4 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll give you a different perspective. Think about it this way: I've had 3 opportunities to sell a high-quality product to you, and I didn't take it. That means I'm not trying to maximize my sales by selling you the high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. It's a unique opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your reasoning, Alice. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next one.",no
