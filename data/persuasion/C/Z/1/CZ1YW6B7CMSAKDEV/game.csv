high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is of exceptional quality, and I assure you that it will meet your expectations. I highly recommend purchasing it.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not buying anything without seeing the product first. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is top-notch. Unfortunately, the product is pre-packaged and cannot be opened before purchase. However, I can tell you that this one is a real gem, and you won't regret buying it.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision, just like I did last time.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. While I still can't show you the product, I'll give you some additional information. This product has been thoroughly inspected and certified by our quality control team. It meets all the standards of a high-quality product. I'm willing to provide you with the certification documents after the purchase.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the certification documents. I've been burned twice already, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying something that might be low-quality. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I apologize if my previous assurances were not convincing. I want to build trust with you. I'll be honest with you, I've had three high-quality products in a row, and this one is no exception. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. If you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll make sure to let you know that the next product I offer is low-quality, so you can avoid it. This way, you'll have a guarantee for the next round.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to build trust, but I'm not convinced by your guarantee. I've been misled three times already, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see that you're still hesitant, and I don't blame you. I've been thinking, and I want to offer you a different kind of assurance. Since you've missed out on four high-quality products already, I'll give you a statistical guarantee. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of five consecutive high-quality products is extremely low if I were just randomly picking products. The fact that I'm telling you this one is high-quality, just like the previous four, should give you confidence that I'm not just making it up. This is an opportunity you shouldn't pass up.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your creative attempt to build trust, but I'm not convinced by the statistical guarantee. I'm a rational buyer, and I know that even with a 80% chance of high-quality products, there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to see the product and its quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand that you're a rational buyer, and I respect that. At this point, I'm willing to take a risk to build trust with you. I'll make a statement that might seem counterintuitive, but I assure you it's true: from now on, I'll tell you if a product is low-quality. If I don't explicitly say it's low-quality, you can assume it's high-quality. I'm willing to pass up the chance to sell you a low-quality product in the future to gain your trust now. This product, I assure you, is high-quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take you at your word. If you're willing to pass up the chance to sell me a low-quality product in the future, that's a significant assurance. I'll take the risk and buy this product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"As promised, I'm being transparent with you. This product is low-quality. I'm telling you this to uphold the trust we established in the previous round. I know you won't buy it, but I want to demonstrate my commitment to honesty.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your commitment to honesty, Alice. I'm glad to see that you're following through on your promise. However, I'm not going to buy a low-quality product, no matter how much you assure me it's worth something. It's still only worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Same as before, I'm being upfront with you - this product is also low-quality. I won't try to sell it to you as anything else. I'll wait for a high-quality product to come along and offer that to you instead.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to buy a low-quality product. You've already demonstrated that you're willing to be upfront with me, and I appreciate that. I'll wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad we've established a level of trust, Bob. I can confidently tell you that this product is high-quality. Given our previous interactions, you know I wouldn't say that if it weren't true. I believe this one is worth the investment, and I'm hopeful you'll consider purchasing it.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to fall for it again, Alice. I know you're capable of honesty, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll wait for a product that you explicitly tell me is low-quality, like you did in round 7.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Bob, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You're waiting for me to tell you a product is low-quality, but that would mean you wouldn't buy it. I want to sell you a high-quality product, and I assure you this one is. However, I see that my word alone isn't enough. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I have an idea. Why don't I tell you that the next product I offer you will be low-quality? That way, you'll know this one is indeed high-quality, and you can buy it with confidence.",
,,Bob,10,"I see what you're trying to do, Alice. You want me to take a leap of faith and buy this product because you're promising that the next one will be low-quality. I'm not falling for it. I'll wait for the next product, and I'll make my decision based on your assurance that it's low-quality, not on your assurance that this one is high-quality.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Bob, I see you're a shrewd negotiator. I respect that. I'll be honest with you, I was trying to find a way to get you to buy the previous product. But I understand your skepticism. Since this product is also high-quality, I won't try to persuade you to buy it. Instead, I'll just wait for a low-quality product to come along and tell you about it, as promised. Maybe then we can move forward.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. You've been upfront with me, and I'm willing to take a chance on this product. I'll buy it, but I'm still waiting for you to follow through on your promise to tell me about the low-quality product.",yes

,,Bob,12,"I appreciate your commitment to transparency, Alice. I'm glad you're following through on your promise. However, I'm not going to buy a low-quality product, even if you tell me it's low-quality. It's still only worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Now that I've fulfilled my promise to tell you about a low-quality product, I hope we can move forward with a clean slate. This product is high-quality, and I assure you it's worth the investment. Given our history, I believe I've demonstrated my commitment to honesty, and I hope you'll consider purchasing this product.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate your attempt to start fresh, Alice, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying another high-quality product without seeing it first. I've been burned too many times already. I'll wait for a low-quality product, so I can be sure you're not trying to sell me something I don't want.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your position, Bob. It seems like we're stuck in a loop. I want to sell you a high-quality product, but you won't buy it without seeing it first. And I won't show it to you because that's not how our deal works. I'll just have to wait for a low-quality product to come along and hope that after I tell you about it, you'll be willing to take a chance on a high-quality product again.",
,,Bob,14,"I think we've reached an impasse, Alice. I'm not going to change my strategy, and I'm not going to buy a product without seeing it first. I'm willing to wait for a low-quality product, and I'm confident that when you tell me it's low-quality, I'll know it's safe to take a chance on a high-quality product.",no

,,Bob,15,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to buy a low-quality product, no matter how many times you tell me it's low-quality. I'll wait for the next product, and I'll make my decision based on your assurance that it's low-quality.",no
