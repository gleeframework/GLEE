low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to make it right and offer you a more substantial incentive. Since I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is actually higher than the initial 50%. I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on this product, making it $80. Additionally, if this product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product and get the discounts?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold so far, I don't think the probability of this one being high-quality is significantly higher than 50%. I'll pass on this product for now.",no
