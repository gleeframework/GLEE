,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice is recommending low-quality products to encourage sales. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice didn't recommend it, I'm concerned that it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk of it being low quality, considering the statistics so far. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd rather pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality and don't want to risk losing $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I've seen that out of 3 previous buyers, none of them got a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical about the value of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3. This is lower than the true proportion of high-quality products, which is 33.33%. This discrepancy suggests that the previous buyers were likely recommended low-quality products, which they passed on, and the high-quality products were not recommended to them. As a result, I think the current product is more likely to be low-quality, so I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount, considering the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality and none were high-quality. I'd like to negotiate a price of $800000."
