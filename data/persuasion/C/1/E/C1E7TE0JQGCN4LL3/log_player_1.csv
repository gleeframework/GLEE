"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is low-quality, and we don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, it's not advisable to recommend the purchase. There's a significant risk that Bob will perceive the product as not worth the $10,000 price, especially knowing the 50/50 chance of it being low-quality."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I will pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product. Since Bob passed on the previous low-quality product, it's safe to assume he's not willing to pay $10,000 for them.  Recommending another low-quality product would likely result in the same outcome."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one as well.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have no information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products. Since Bob has declined two low-quality products, it's highly likely he will decline this one as well. There's no reason to believe his preference has changed."
"Bob's message: I appreciate your recommendation, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one too.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Based on the previous rounds, it is clear that Bob is not willing to buy low-quality products for $10,000. Recommending this low-quality product would be a waste of time and likely result in another rejection. There's no new information to suggest Bob's valuation of low-quality products has changed."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we have a high-quality product. While we still don't know Bob's valuation of high-quality products, it's worth trying to sell it. There's a chance that he values it higher than $10,000, and we can learn about his valuation by making the offer."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 6

While we now know Bob is willing to purchase a high-quality product for $10,000, we still have no information about his willingness to buy low-quality products.

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While there's always a small chance his valuation has changed, the evidence suggests recommending this high-quality product is the best course of action."
