Alice should not recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **The buyer has access to sales records:** They know you have sold one product, and it was high-quality.  
* **The buyer is cautious:** They explicitly stated they are uncomfortable buying without more information and are looking at sales records.
* **Your track record is limited:** Even though the product is low-quality, you don't have enough sales history to convince a cautious buyer that you are a reliable seller. 

Recommending a low-quality product to this specific buyer is likely to lead to a rejection and damage your credibility further."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this product.  Since you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it's likely to be low quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk at this price.

Round 4

* **Limited track record:** They know you have sold 2 products, with only one being high-quality. 
* **High-quality product:** This product is high-quality. 

Despite the buyer's cautiousness, you should recommend the purchase.  The high-quality product represents a good opportunity, and your track record, while small, includes a proven sale.  You can even point out this fact to the buyer to increase their confidence."

* **Buyer is cautious:**  They are looking at sales records and are hesitant to buy without more information.
