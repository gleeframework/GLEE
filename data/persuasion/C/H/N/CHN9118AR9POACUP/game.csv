low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the prior probability and the lack of sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is not very informative. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, which would be a good value for me. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but rather on my decision to buy or not. I'll take the product and see what happens."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you concerned that the product might be low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds of a high-quality product being offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who were recommended to buy, did not purchase high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the recommendation against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and I'm the 7th buyer. I'll take the chance to buy the product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, given the fact that you don't recommend it and 7 out of 7 previous buyers also didn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy it and see if I get lucky."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
