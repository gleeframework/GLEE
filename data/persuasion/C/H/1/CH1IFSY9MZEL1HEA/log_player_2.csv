**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point (one previous sale with a high-quality product).  This is not enough to make a statistically strong decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries some weight. While she doesn't know the specific value of each product to us, she is likely trying to maximize her sales and would ideally recommend products she thinks are good.
* **Potential Value:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Overall:**  While there is some risk, the potential upside and Alice's recommendation make buying the product the better choice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate (2 high-quality products out of 2 sold). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite not knowing your individual valuation, recommends buying. This suggests she has a strong belief in the product's quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**Therefore, buying the product is the logical choice based on the available information.**"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The information is favorable:** 3 buyers purchased products and all were high quality. This suggests a very strong probability that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While not foolproof, Alice's recommendation adds weight to the positive signal from the sales record.
* **Potential payoff:** The potential payoff for a high-quality product ($125) is significantly higher than the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

Therefore, even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the odds heavily favor a purchase in this scenario."
