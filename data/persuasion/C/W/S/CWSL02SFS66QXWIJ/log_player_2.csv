Alice's message: I've sold two products so far, and I'm glad you're considering buying from me. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a 50% success rate so far, which is exactly what you'd expect given the probability of a product being high-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. This product is the third one I'm offering, and I'm confident that it's just as good as the others. However, I want to give you a heads up that my success rate is still 50%, so you're just as likely to get a low-quality product as a high-quality one. Will you take the chance and buy it for $100?
