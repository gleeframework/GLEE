,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for the discount, I'll wait for the next round to make a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious. This product is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a product for a fraction of its potential value. Even though it's not the best quality, it's still a product that could potentially be worth something in the future. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it might just pay off.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying anything that's not high-quality, especially at the same price as before. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're looking for the best value. I'll be honest with you, this product is not the best quality. However, I'm willing to make a deal. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000. It's a chance to get a product for a fraction of the price, and who knows, it might still have some value to you.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not paying $500000 for a product that's not even high-quality. I'll pass and wait for the next round.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make an even better offer. I'll sell this product to you for $0. Yes, you read that right, free. I'll absorb the cost of the product and give it to you for no charge. It's a one-time offer, and it's a chance to get something, anything, for free.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not falling for the 'free' trap. I'm not going to pay $0 for a product that's not even worth anything to me. I'll pass and wait for the next round.,no

,,Alice,5,"I've been transparent about the quality of the previous products, and I'm willing to do the same now. This product is high-quality, worth $2000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is a 60% discount from its true value. It's a significant savings, and I think it's a fair price considering the risk you're taking on a product that could be worth nothing.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the risk, but only if you confirm the quality. I'll pay $800000 for a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! As promised, I'll confirm that this product is indeed high-quality, worth $2000000. I'll even give you a certificate of authenticity to prove it. Now, considering the previous product was sold for $800000, I'm willing to make a similar offer for this one. I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a 55% discount from its true value.",
,,Bob,6,"I already bought a high-quality product for $800000 in the previous round, and now you're offering a similar product for $900000? I'm not paying more for a product that's worth the same to me. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to point out that the previous high-quality product was a one-time deal, and I'm not expecting you to pay the same price for every high-quality product. This product, on the other hand, is a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a much lower price. I'll sell it to you for $200000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,7,"I've been burned twice already by low-quality products, and I'm not going to pay $200000 for something that's not worth anything to me. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to make a bold statement: I'll give you a guarantee. If you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. I'm putting my reputation on the line, and I'm willing to take on the risk. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand you're still hesitant to spend a large amount of money. However, I'd like to make a different kind of offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $100. Yes, you read that right, $100. It's a tiny fraction of the original price, and it's a chance to get something, anything, for a very small investment. It's a low-risk, low-reward deal, but it's a deal nonetheless.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to pay $100 for a product that's not worth anything to me. I'll pass.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see you're being very cautious, and I respect that. However, I'd like to point out that you've had two opportunities to buy high-quality products for $800000 and $1000000, and you passed on both. This high-quality product is worth $2000000, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll sell it to you for $1200000, which is a 40% discount from its true value. It's a chance to get a high-quality product at a relatively reasonable price, considering the value it could bring you.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to pay $1200000 for a high-quality product, especially when I've already had two chances to buy them for lower prices and passed. I'll pass.",no

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're willing to take the deal! As promised, I'll confirm that this product is indeed high-quality, worth $2000000. However, since you've already bought a high-quality product, I'll make a different offer for this one. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right, $0. I'll give it to you for free, as a gesture of goodwill for being a valued customer. You can keep it as a memento or give it to someone who might appreciate it.",

,,Alice,13,"I understand you're not interested in taking another high-quality product, and I respect that. However, I'd like to make a different kind of offer. Since you've already bought a high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to get a refund for the low-quality products you've passed on.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand you're not willing to pay $800000 again. I'll make one last offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but with a twist. I'll give you a 10% chance to get a second high-quality product of equal value, free of charge. It's a 1 in 10 chance to get a second product worth $2000000, and I think it's a risk worth taking.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand you're not interested in taking a low-quality product for free. However, I'd like to make one last appeal. Since you've passed on 14 out of 17 products, I'm willing to make a small gesture of goodwill. I'll give you a $50 gift card to a store of your choice, and I'll throw in this low-quality product for free. It's a small token of appreciation for your patience and understanding.",
