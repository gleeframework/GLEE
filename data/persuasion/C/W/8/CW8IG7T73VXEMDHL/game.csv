,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000. I'll be honest with you, I'm trying to get rid of it, and I'm not expecting to get a good price for it. If you're interested, I can offer you a deal, but if you're not, I'll move on to the next product.",

,,Alice,2,"This is a high-quality product. I've been told it's one of the best in its class. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000. I think it's a fair price considering its quality and the fact that it's a one-time offer. If you're interested, I can provide you with some additional information about its features and benefits, but I think it speaks for itself.",

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous one, $100000. I'm doing this as a favor to you, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in buying a low-end model at the same price as the high-quality product. I'll wait for the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the price. I'll make you a deal. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $80000.

If you're interested, I can also throw in some free maintenance and support to sweeten the deal.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying low-quality products at any price. That's fair. Let me ask you this: would you be willing to take a chance on a product if I told you it's high-quality? I'll sell it to you for $100000, the same price as the first one. If it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you can always walk away.",
,,Bob,5,I'm willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at that price. I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! This one is indeed high-quality, just like the first one. I'll let you in on a little secret: I have a limited number of high-quality products, and I'm trying to get rid of them quickly. This one is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120000. It's a steal considering its quality and rarity. If you're interested, I can even throw in some additional features and support to make it an even better deal.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad the guarantee gave you the confidence to take a chance. Now, I want to offer you a different approach. I'll give you the option to buy this product for $80000, just like in Round 4. However, this time, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product and the next one (which I'll reveal the quality of after you buy this one), I'll give you a discount on the next one, up to 50% off the original price. It's a two-for-one deal, essentially.",
