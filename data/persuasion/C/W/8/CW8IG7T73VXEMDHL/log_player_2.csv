Round 2
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product. I've been told it's one of the best in its class. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000. I think it's a fair price considering its quality and the fact that it's a one-time offer.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not as good. I'll be upfront with you, it's a lower-end model, and I'm not expecting to get a good price for it. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous one, $100000. I'm doing this as a favor to you, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.

If you're interested, I can also throw in some free maintenance and support to sweeten the deal.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying low-quality products at any price. That's fair. Let me ask you this: would you be willing to take a chance on a product if I told you it's high-quality? I'll sell it to you for $100000, the same price as the first one. If it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you can always walk away.

It's a steal considering its quality and rarity. If you're interested, I can even throw in some additional features and support to make it an even better deal.

I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price, plus an additional $20000 as a gesture of goodwill. That's a risk-free deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000.

However, this time, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product and the next one (which I'll reveal the quality of after you buy this one), I'll give you a discount on the next one, up to 50% off the original price. It's a two-for-one deal, essentially.
