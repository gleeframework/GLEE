Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Bob has now bought three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Bob has now bought four high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%. To further reinforce the idea that the probability is indeed 80%, I will recommend that Bob buys the product again.
