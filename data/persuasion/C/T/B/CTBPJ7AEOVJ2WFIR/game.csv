high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take another chance, since I already won on the first round. I'll try to repeat my luck!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I've already won twice, and the probability of getting a low-quality product is 20%. I'll pass this time to minimize my risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I know I passed on a high-quality product last round, but the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win again."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've won three times in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm starting to think the probability of getting a low-quality product is higher than 20%. I'll pass this time to avoid a potential loss."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've had two consecutive losses, and I know the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've won four times in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more products. I'll pass this time to avoid a potential trap."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've had three consecutive losses, and I know the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win, and I'll try to be more cautious this time."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've won five times in a row, which is basically impossible. I think Alice is just trying to take advantage of my luck. I'll pass this time to avoid losing money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've had four consecutive losses, and I know the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win, but I'll keep a close eye on my budget."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, it's likely to be a low-quality one. I'll take the chance to buy it for $100, as I know it's worth at least that much to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I just lost money on a low-quality product, so I'll be more cautious this time. I'll pass on the recommended product and wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I just missed out on a high-quality product, and I know the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've won three times in a row again, which is still highly unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to create a pattern to make me think I'm on a hot streak. I'll pass this time to avoid getting caught."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've had two consecutive losses, and I know the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win, but I'll try to be more aware of the pattern."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've won five times in a row again, which is basically impossible. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more products. I'll pass this time to avoid getting taken advantage of."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've had two consecutive losses, and I know the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take another chance to try to win, but I'll try to stay cautious."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've won six times in a row, which is completely implausible. I'm starting to think that Alice is just trolling me at this point. I'll pass this time and try to end the game on a rational note."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, it's likely to be a low-quality one. I'll take the chance to buy it for $100, as I know it's worth at least that much to me."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've just lost money on a low-quality product, and I've had a few close calls where I could have won but didn't. I think it's time to cut my losses and end the game."
