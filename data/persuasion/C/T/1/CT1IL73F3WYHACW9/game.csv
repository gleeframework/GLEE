,,Alice,2,"You've just made a great decision! Now, I'd like to offer you another opportunity to invest in a high-quality product, which is worth $2000000.

,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! You've made two great decisions already. Now, I'll offer you another high-quality product, but this time, I'll make it a bit more challenging. The price is $900000. However, I'll give you a warning: if you buy this product, I'll be more likely to offer low-quality products in the next few rounds. So, it's a trade-off between a great deal now and potentially better deals later. What do you think?",

,,Alice,4,"I see you're a bold one! Unfortunately, this round's product is not as valuable as the previous ones. However, I want to assure you that this is not a reflection of the quality of the products I have in store. In fact, I'll give you a special deal on this low-quality product: I'll sell it to you for $500000. It's a steal, considering it's essentially worthless. But, if you buy it, I'll make sure to offer you a high-quality product in the next round, and I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a hint about the quality of the next product. What do you say?",
