high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is no, so I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the fact that Alice recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'll pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what makes you think this product is low quality? Is it based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason? I'd like to understand your thought process."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
