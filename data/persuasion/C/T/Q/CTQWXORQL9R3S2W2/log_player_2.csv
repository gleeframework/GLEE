**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Since there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and Alice has already sold one high-quality product, it's likely that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, as a seller, is likely to recommend buying a product that she believes has a higher chance of being high quality. This further increases the odds in your favor.
* **Potential gain vs. risk:** If the product is high quality, you'll make a profit of $20. If it's low quality, you lose $100.  The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
