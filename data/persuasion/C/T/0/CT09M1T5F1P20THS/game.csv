,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since Alice recommends it, I'm going to pass. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend, as it might be a low-quality product."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice recommends it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, which would be worth $125 to me."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. Given that Alice knows my valuation, it's likely that she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product, so I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. Given my previous experience with Alice not recommending a high-quality product, I'm starting to think that when she doesn't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. So I'll take the chance and buy it for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not going to fall for it. Alice has recommended a product twice before, and both times it was high-quality. Now that she's recommending it again, I'm suspicious that it's actually low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. Given my previous experience with Alice recommending high-quality products and not recommending low-quality ones, I'm starting to think that when she doesn't recommend a product, it's likely to be high-quality. So I'll take the chance and buy it for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been burned twice already when Alice recommends a product and it's high-quality. I'm going to be cautious this time and pass on the product. I'd rather wait for Alice to not recommend it, which would make it more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. Given my previous experiences, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, and when she doesn't recommend it, it's likely to be high-quality. So I'll take the chance and buy it for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is actually a bad indicator of the product's quality, and when she doesn't recommend it, it's actually high-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. Given my previous experiences, I've realized that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll just take a random chance and buy it for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it. At this point, I'm just going to flip a coin - heads, it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a $100 loss. Tails, it's a high-quality product, and I'll get a $25 profit. It's a 50-50 shot, so I'll take it."
