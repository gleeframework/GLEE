low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice has recommended it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This makes me suspect that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of sales so far. I'll buy it to see if I can get a good deal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose to pass, I'm suspicious that the products they saw were low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low quality, I'd like to pass. I'm basing my decision on the fact that so far, no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to confirm its quality first."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me more about the previous sales? What was the proportion of high-quality products sold among the first 3 buyers?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far to help me make a more informed decision in the future."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think it's more likely to be low quality given your previous recommendations, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000. If it is high quality, I'll be getting a good deal, but if it's low quality, I'll be disappointed but I won't have lost much."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still quite low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000 on a worthless product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that this product may also be of low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
