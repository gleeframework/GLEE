**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:** Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. While it doesn't guarantee the product is high quality, it suggests Alice believes it's worth buying.
* **Historical Data:**  The historical data is strong: 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This significantly increases the perceived probability of this product also being high quality. 
* **Value:**  Even if there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $200 outweighs the potential loss of $100. 

**Overall:** The combination of a positive recommendation and strong historical data makes this a good risk/reward scenario."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products recommended by Alice so far have been high quality. This is a strong indicator that her recommendations are accurate.
* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $200 to you, significantly exceeding the $100 price.
* **Risk:**  While there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the high success rate of Alice's recommendations makes this risk manageable.

**In this scenario, the potential reward outweighs the risk, making it a rational decision to buy.**"
