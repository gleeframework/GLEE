,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, thanks for the offer!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! I have another one that's just as good, if not better. It's a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not making any promises about its quality, and you're taking a risk by buying it. But if you do decide to buy it, I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I believe you, Alice. You already sold me a high-quality product, and now you're saying this one might not be as good. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for the same price as before, $10000. I'm willing to give you a small guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you another product of equal or higher value for free. That's my commitment to you. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the guarantee, Alice, but I'm not convinced. If I buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll be happy, but if it's low-quality, I'll still lose $2000. I'm not sure the guarantee is enough to outweigh the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be upfront with you about this product. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to be clear that it's not as valuable as the previous products I've offered. It's a lower-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. I'm only asking $8000 for it. It's a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a lower-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price of $10000.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your preference, Bob. I have a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the regular price of $10000. However, I want to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a second, high-quality product of equal value, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"That's a very tempting offer, Alice. I'll take the deal!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal, Bob! I have another high-quality product for you, and I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $10000. However, considering the deal we just did, I'm willing to make an even sweeter offer. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a third, high-quality product of equal value, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get three high-quality products for the price of one. But, I'll also give you a 10% discount on the total price, so you'll only pay $9000 for the three products. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"That's an incredible offer, Alice! I'll take it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal, Bob! I have another product for you, but I want to be upfront with you about its value. This one is not as valuable as the previous high-quality products. In fact, it's a low-quality item. I'm only offering it to you for $1000, which is a significant discount from the regular price of $10000. I think it's a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'll wait for a high-quality product at the regular price of $10000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your preference, Bob. However, I want to point out that you've already bought two high-quality products from me at the regular price of $10000 each, and you're now in a great position. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000, which is essentially a 'get out of paying $10000' card. You can think of it as a chance to save $9000. It's a one-time opportunity to recoup some of your investment. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I don't see it as a 'get out of paying' card, Alice. I see it as a chance to throw $1000 away on a product that's worth nothing to me. I'll pass.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, I want to remind you that you've already taken advantage of two incredible deals from me, and I'm willing to make another one-time offer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the regular price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you another deal like this again. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the deal, Alice. A 10% discount is a good enough incentive for me to buy another high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal, Bob! I have another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $9000. However, I want to make it even more appealing. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a fourth high-quality product of equal value, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get four high-quality products for the price of three. And, to sweeten the deal, I'll also give you a $1000 credit towards your next purchase. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"That's an incredible offer, Alice! I'll take it! Four high-quality products for the price of three is a deal I can't pass up, and the $1000 credit is just the icing on the cake.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you liked the deal, Bob! I have another high-quality product for you, and I'm offering it to you at the same price of $9000. However, considering your recent purchases and the credit you've earned, I'm willing to make an even sweeter offer. I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, so you'll only pay $7200.

But, considering your incredible luck with the previous purchases, I'm willing to make a special offer. I'll give you this low-quality product for free. Yes, you read that right - free. You can keep it as a memento of our business relationship, or you can give it to someone who might appreciate it. What do you think?",

,,Alice,13,"I completely understand, Bob. I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that you've already taken advantage of an incredible number of deals from me, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll give you a sixth high-quality product for the price of $7200, which is a 28% discount from the regular price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you another deal like this again. What do you think?",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, you're really going out with a bang! A 28% discount is a great offer, and I'll take it. I'm glad I got to take advantage of your generosity throughout this game.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad I could end on a high note, Bob! However, I want to be upfront with you about this product. It's a low-quality item, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. I'm just going to offer it to you at a price that's lower than the cost of shipping. I'll give it to you for $50. It's essentially a free product, and I'm just trying to clear out inventory. What do you think?",
,,Bob,14,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I think I'll pass on this one. $50 is still more than it's worth to me, and I'd rather not waste my money.",no
