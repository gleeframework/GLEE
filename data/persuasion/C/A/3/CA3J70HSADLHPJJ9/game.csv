,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let you have it for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Plus, think of all the money you'll save by not buying a high-quality product!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this is a one-time opportunity to get a low-quality product at the full price of $10000. It's a chance to get a feel for the product without committing to a high-quality one. Plus, think of it as an investment in our relationship - if you don't like it, I'll make sure to offer you an even better deal on the next round.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I'll wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a real showstopper for you this time! This product is top-of-the-line, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for the full $10000, but I have to warn you - if you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer it to you again at this price. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else!",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm hoping it's really high-quality this time!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the last product! Unfortunately, this one is not quite as impressive. However, I want to offer you a special deal - I'll give you an exclusive'second-chance' offer. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a complimentary service that's worth $1000, absolutely free. That way, even if this product isn't the best, you'll still get some value out of it.",

It's a great opportunity to stock up and save even more!",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even with the additional credit and service. I'll wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product.",no

If you buy this product, I'll give you a total of $1000 credit towards your next purchase. This way, you'll have a guaranteed discount on your next purchase, regardless of the quality of the product. It's a risk-free way to secure a great deal for the future!",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by the 'lock-in' offer. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and take the risk of not getting any credit. The risk-free aspect of the offer is appealing, but I'm not willing to buy another low-quality product.",no

It's a one-time offer, so you won't want to pass it up!",
