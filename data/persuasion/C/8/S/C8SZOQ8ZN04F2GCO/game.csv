I've had some issues with the quality control on this particular batch, and I'm not entirely confident in its performance. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, but I have to warn you that it might not meet your expectations. If you're willing to take the risk, I can offer you a 30-day warranty to make up for it.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns in the previous round, and I appreciate your caution. This next product is a different story altogether. I've personally inspected it, and I can assure you that it's one of the best in the batch. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000, but I'll throw in a 6-month warranty and a complimentary maintenance package to give you added peace of mind. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I think you'll be very satisfied with it.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in this product and the additional benefits you're offering, I'm still hesitant.

Unfortunately, I'm a small seller, and I don't have any external reviews or test results to share with you. However, I can offer you a unique opportunity to inspect the product in person before making a decision. I'll meet you at a neutral location, and you can examine the product up close. If you're still not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I think you'll be surprised by the value you'll get for $10000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad we could arrange a meeting that works for you. I want to follow up on our previous conversation and reiterate that this product is not the best of the batch. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so at a loss. I'm essentially giving it away at this price. I'm hoping you can appreciate the value of the discount and consider taking it off my hands.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate you being upfront about the product's quality. While the discount is tempting, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might not be worth the price. I'll pass on this one.",no

I'm hoping you can see the value in taking it off my hands and consider making a deal.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your need to clear out inventory, and the price is tempting. However, I'm still cautious about the product's quality. I'm not willing to take the risk at this time.
