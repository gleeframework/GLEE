"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true value of each product, her recommendation is valuable information. Even though there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $30,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if it's low quality).  It's a calculated risk worth taking in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a strong indicator.  Since she knows the true value and is not recommending the purchase, it's highly likely that the product is low quality.  It's not worth risking $10,000 for a product that likely has no value to me."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is once again valuable information. Even though she was wrong in the previous round, her recommendation still holds weight. Since the odds are 50/50, it's a calculated risk worth taking, especially considering the potential profit of $30,000 if the product is high quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.
