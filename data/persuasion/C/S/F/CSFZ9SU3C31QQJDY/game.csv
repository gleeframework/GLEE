low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the probability of the current product being high quality given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision, especially since the first buyer purchased the product. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics?"

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can I see the previous sales record to help me make a more informed decision for the next product?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the average, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I've seen that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases. This means that 2 out of 3 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, this seems to be consistent with the data. I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3, which is a relatively low proportion. This suggests that there may be more low-quality products in the remaining pool, making it more likely that the current product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
