high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal!,
,,Bob,1,"Since you've revealed that it's a high-quality product and I value it at $200, buying it for $100 is indeed a great deal for me.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you pass on it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm sure you'll regret it.",
,,Bob,2,"As before, since you've revealed that it's a high-quality product, buying it for $100 is still a good deal for me, regardless of your other potential buyers.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! This high-quality product is a great opportunity to continue your winning streak. I'm offering it to you for $100. If you pass, you'll be giving up a chance to buy a product worth at least $200, and I'll be left with a potential loss.",
,,Bob,3,"The fact remains that buying a high-quality product for $100 is a good deal for me, so I'll continue to take advantage of the opportunity.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're just taking advantage of my generosity! This product is actually a bit of a dud, but I'll let you in on a secret: it's still worth something to me. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth that much to you.",
,,Bob,4,"Since you've revealed that this product is a dud, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. In that case, buying it for $100 would be a bad deal, so I'll pass on it.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're being cautious with the low-quality products. This one is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to make it clear: it's worth at least $200 to me. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I think you'd be foolish to pass it up.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not concerned with the value to you, but since you've revealed that it's a high-quality product, which is worth $200 to me, buying it for $100 is still a good deal, so I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a savvy buyer, I'll give you that. This high-quality product is similar to the previous ones, and I'm offering it to you for $100. However, I want to make it clear that I've already sold three high-quality products to you at this price, and I'm starting to think you're taking advantage of my willingness to sell at a discount. If you pass, I'll have to reevaluate our business relationship.",
,,Bob,6,"I understand your concerns, but from a purely financial perspective, buying a high-quality product for $100 is still a good deal for me, regardless of our past transactions. I'll continue to make decisions based on the value I receive.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're sticking to your strategy, but I'm not sure how long I can keep offering you high-quality products at this price. This one is indeed high-quality, but I'm starting to think I should reconsider my pricing. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not making any promises about future sales.",
,,Bob,7,"As long as you're offering high-quality products at $100, I'll continue to buy them, since they're worth $200 to me. If you decide to change your pricing in the future, I'll reassess my buying strategy at that time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think I've made my point about the high-quality products. This one, on the other hand, is a dud. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it. I'm offering it to you for $50, a significant discount from the usual $100.",
,,Bob,8,"Even at a discounted price of $50, a low-quality product is still worth $0 to me, so I'll pass on it. The discount doesn't change the fact that it has no value to me.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're consistent in your decision-making. This high-quality product is a great opportunity for you to continue your streak of buying high-quality products at a discount. I'm willing to make a one-time exception: I'll offer it to you for $100, but I'll also throw in a guarantee - if you buy it, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next high-quality product you buy from me. It's a deal you can't pass up!",
,,Bob,9,"While the guarantee for a future discount is nice, it's not the deciding factor for me. Since this is a high-quality product, worth $200 to me, buying it for $100 is still a good deal on its own. I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a shrewd negotiator, I'll give you that. Alright, I'll make one more concession. This high-quality product is a great one, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, just like the others. However, I'm also willing to throw in a second high-quality product of your choice from our remaining stock, absolutely free. That's a $200 value, for the price of one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"While the offer of a free second product is enticing, my decision is still based on the value of the current product. Since it's a high-quality product, worth $200 to me, buying it for $100 is a good deal. The potential free second product is just an added bonus.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a master of the deal, Bob. Alright, I'll stop trying to negotiate with you. This high-quality product is indeed worth $200 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'll just say it one more time: this is a great opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a discount. Take it or leave it.",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I think I've finally gotten the message. This high-quality product is the last one I have in stock, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'll just say it's a great product and a great deal, and leave it at that.",
,,Bob,12,"Same reasoning as before: it's a high-quality product, worth $200 to me, and buying it for $100 is a good deal. I'll take it.",yes

,,Bob,14,"Indeed, I will take it. A high-quality product worth $200 to me for $100 is a good deal, and I'll continue to make the same decision as before.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Finally, a product that's not worth $200 to you. This one's a dud, and I'm not even going to try to spin it. I'm offering it to you for $50, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it.",
