,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a top-notch item at a discounted price. I'm willing to make a deal, but you have to act now. The product is worth $1250000 to you, so it's a 20% discount. Don't miss out on this chance to save $250000.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for the pressure sale. I'll pass on this opportunity.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll give you a more neutral message this time. This product is a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and this one fits that profile. It's up to you to decide whether the potential gain is worth the risk of it being a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because the odds are in my favor. I'm expecting a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product, Bob! Given that you've already had a positive experience with the first high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you another opportunity. This product is also high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with its quality. However, I'm increasing the price to $1050000. You've already proven that you value high-quality products, and I believe this one is worth the investment.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not willing to pay a premium for the second product. The price increase doesn't justify the risk of it being low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution, Bob. I'll make you a counteroffer. Since you're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'll offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50000. This way, you'll only lose $950000 on a low-quality product, which is still a better deal than the original price. The product is worth $1250000 to you, and I'm willing to take on some of the risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in your 'guarantee'. The risk is still there, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your decision, Bob. Let's try a different approach. I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' price of $1000000, but with a twist. I'll give you the option to inspect the product before buying it. You can take a closer look, ask questions, and verify its quality before making a decision. This way, you'll have more confidence in the product's worth. If you're still not convinced, you can walk away. But if you decide to buy, I'll throw in a free inspection report from a third-party expert, so you'll have an independent verification of the product's quality.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing for sure whether it's high-quality or low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be upfront with you this time. This product is not high-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for $100000, which is a fraction of the original price. I know it's not the best product, but it's a chance to get something for a low price. If you're not interested, I can offer you a 'break-even' deal: I'll give you $100000 back if you don't like the product. It's a no-lose situation for you.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'm not going to pay $100000 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no

,,Alice,7,"I'll make it simple, Bob. This product is high-quality, and it's worth $1250000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a 20% discount. I've given you a chance to inspect the product, and I've offered you various deals, but you've passed on them. I'm not going to lower the price any further. If you want a high-quality product, this is your chance to get it at a good price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for the same old pitch again. I've passed on the same offer multiple times before, and I'm not going to change my mind now. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're not interested in the same offer again, Bob. Let's try a different approach. I'll offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal. You've had a chance to see that I've been offering high-quality products, and you've passed on them. I'm willing to make a one-time exception. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and it's a one-time deal. If you don't take it, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to pay $900000 for a product that I don't know for sure is high-quality. The discount doesn't change my risk assessment, and I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to make you a high-pressure pitch this time, Bob. I'll just be honest with you. This product is not high-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for $50000, which is a tiny fraction of the original price. It's not a great deal for you, but it's a chance to get something for a very low price. If you're not interested, I'll just move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to pay $50000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this opportunity.,no

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob. I'll make one last appeal. You've had 10 chances to buy a high-quality product, and you've passed on every one of them. I'm willing to take on the risk myself. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you the full $1250000. You'll get the product's full value, and I'll take the loss. If it's high-quality, you'll get the product at the original price of $1000000. It's a no-risk deal for you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'm willing to take advantage of this no-risk deal. I'll buy the product and see what happens.,yes

I know you've had a good experience with the previous product, and I'm confident this one will meet your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is the original price. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I do need to make a sale. If you're happy with the previous product, I think you'll be happy with this one as well.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not going to fall for the same old pitch again. I've already had a good experience with the previous product, but that doesn't guarantee that this one will be high-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand you're being cautious, Bob. I'll admit, I was expecting a different reaction. Given that you've already taken advantage of the no-risk deal and got a high-quality product, I'm willing to make a special offer. I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer a deal like this again. If you're interested, this is your chance to get a high-quality product at a significantly lower price.",
,,Bob,13,"A 50% discount is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a product that could be low-quality. The discount doesn't change my risk assessment, and I'll pass on this opportunity.",no

,,Alice,18,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make one final offer. Since you've already received two high-quality products for free, I'll give you a chance to pay for this one. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a unique condition: I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product. If you're not happy, you'll get your money back. This is my final offer, and I'm not going to negotiate further.",
,,Bob,18,I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product that I don't know for sure is high-quality. The 100% refund doesn't change the fact that I'm taking a risk by buying the product. I'll pass on this opportunity.,no
