low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have a 20% chance of selling a high-quality product in this round.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that the previous buyer who purchased a low-quality product for the same price is no longer here to vouch for the product's quality.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality product this time!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 67%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that two consecutive high-quality products have been sold, which is a 1 in 5 chance. This suggests that I may have a strong streak going, but keep in mind that I still have a 33% chance of selling a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take a chance on the product, considering the streak of high-quality products sold so far.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 75%. Given the strong streak of high-quality products, I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. However, keep in mind that the probability of a low-quality product is still 25%, and the price is non-refundable. Consider the fact that the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a low-quality product should be around 20%, which is lower than the current 25%.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, given the strong streak of high-quality products. However, I'm also aware that the probability of a low-quality product is still higher than the historical average. I'm hoping that the law of large numbers will hold true and the product will be high-quality.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 80%. With 4 consecutive high-quality products, the law of large numbers is indeed holding true, and the probability of a low-quality product is decreasing. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to sell a low-quality product soon, and I'm not sure how much longer I can maintain this streak. Consider this when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the impressive streak of high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping the streak continues!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 83%. With 5 consecutive high-quality products, the law of large numbers is strongly in effect, and the probability of a low-quality product is now very low. However, I want to caution you that the probability of a low-quality product is not zero, and I'm still obligated to sell one eventually. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that you're taking on a significant risk, but also the potential reward is substantial.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the high probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 86%. With 6 consecutive high-quality products, it's highly unlikely that the next product will be low-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to feel a strong sense of obligation to sell a low-quality product soon, and I'm not sure how much longer I can maintain this streak. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that you're essentially buying a high-quality product with a very high degree of confidence.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and the streak of consecutive high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping that the streak will continue and I'll get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 87.5%. With 7 consecutive high-quality products, the probability of a low-quality product is extremely low. However, I want to emphasize that this streak is now statistically significant, and it's highly unlikely that the next product will be low-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that you're essentially buying a high-quality product with a near-certainty.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm expecting a high-quality product and am willing to pay $1000000 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 78%. However, I want to be upfront with you: I've finally sold a low-quality product, which means that the probability of a high-quality product is no longer as high as it was. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that the law of large numbers is now back in effect, and the probability of a low-quality product is back to its historical average of 20%.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, considering the historical average of 20% low-quality products and the fact that the law of large numbers is now in effect. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product worth $1250000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 80%. With the recent sale of a low-quality product, the law of large numbers is now back in effect, and the probability of a high-quality product is back to its historical average. However, I want to point out that I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row after the low-quality product, which is a remarkable streak. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that you're buying a product from a seller who has a strong track record of selling high-quality products, and the probability of a low-quality product is still relatively low.",

However, I must remind you that the law of large numbers is still in effect, and the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that you're buying a product from a seller who has an extremely strong track record of selling high-quality products, but also keep in mind that the probability of a low-quality product is still present. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever sell a low-quality product again...",
