However, I want to let you know that I'm eager to make a sale and start building my reputation. I'm willing to be upfront with you - I've had a few products that didn't sell, but that doesn't necessarily reflect their quality. I'm confident that this product is one of the best I've had so far, and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. If you're willing to take a chance, I'd be happy to have you as a customer and start establishing a track record of successful sales.",

,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I've had four previous buyers who were hesitant to make a purchase due to lack of data on my selling record. I understand their concerns and respect their decisions. However, I want to let you know that I'm starting to feel confident that my products are being unfairly judged due to lack of data. I've had a few high-quality products that didn't sell, simply because buyers were hesitant to take a chance. I'm willing to assure you that this product is one of the best I've had so far, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll make sure to provide you with excellent service and support to ensure your satisfaction.",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to provide a guarantee. However, with no previous sales data to rely on, it's impossible for me to assess the true likelihood of this product being high quality. While I respect your confidence, I'd prefer to wait and see how your products perform in the market before making a purchase. Perhaps if you're willing to offer a refund or some form of guarantee in case the product turns out to be low quality, I would be more inclined to take a chance. Until then, I'll pass on this opportunity.",no

I want to let you know that I've taken their feedback into consideration and I'm willing to offer a guarantee - not in the form of a refund, as my prices are final, but in the form of transparency. If you purchase this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll make sure to disclose that information to future buyers, so they can make informed decisions. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. I hope this offer can alleviate some of the risks and help you make a decision.",
