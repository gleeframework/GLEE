,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I want to see if it's a low-quality product, which would confirm my suspicion that the first two buyers were just following your recommendations."

,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it, not because I trust your judgment. I think the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
