It's important to remember that Bob is a rational buyer and is aware of the 80% chance of a high-quality product. However, even though Bob has had a very successful streak,  the price of the product is fixed, and the potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product is significant. While the odds are in favor of a high-quality product, there's still a risk that needs to be considered.  It's best for Bob to play it safe in this last round."
