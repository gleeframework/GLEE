high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice's recommendation carries no weight, and I'll wait for the next round to make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one too. Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't give me any additional information, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice's recommendation is just as likely to be for a low-quality product as a high-quality one, so I'll pass and wait for more information."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice's recommendation, combined with the fact that she's already recommended a high-quality product in the past, makes me think this one might be high-quality too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent with her previous behavior, but it's also consistent with her trying to hide a low-quality product. I'll wait for more information."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice has now recommended both a high-quality and a low-quality product, so her recommendation is just as likely to be for a low-quality product as a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. The fact that Alice didn't recommend it might actually increase the likelihood that it's high-quality, since she's already recommended a high-quality product and a low-quality product, and her recommendation would be less likely to be a low-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not buying it. Two out of the last three low-quality products were not recommended by Alice, so I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation might be a good indicator that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight after she recommended a low-quality product last time, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, and not recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, so her lack of recommendation might be a good indicator that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm not buying it. After buying a low-quality product despite Alice's lack of recommendation last time, and now buying a low-quality product after she recommended it, I'm starting to think that her recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Given that Alice has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, and not recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation might be a good indicator that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not buying it. I've been burned twice already by buying low-quality products after Alice recommended them, and I'm not willing to take that risk again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice has a history of recommending both high-quality and low-quality products, and not recommending both high-quality and low-quality products, so I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation might be a good indicator that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not buying it. I've been burned three times already by buying low-quality products after Alice recommended them or didn't recommend them, and I'm not willing to take that risk again. I think I'll just wait for a recommendation from Alice to be a good indicator of quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice's recommendation after a string of low-quality products doesn't carry much weight, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice has recommended a high-quality product before, and this is the first time she's recommended a high-quality product after a string of low-quality products, so I'm cautiously optimistic that this one might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. After buying a high-quality product after Alice recommended it, and now considering the fact that Alice has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, I think her lack of recommendation might be a good indicator that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"I'm not buying it. I've been burned too many times by buying low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take that risk again. I'm going to stick to my strategy of only buying when Alice recommends a product, and even then, I'll be cautious."
