,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in my product! However, I must inform you that I don't have a crystal ball to predict the quality of my products. But I can tell you that the previous two buyers have purchased two high-quality products from me, which is a good sign. That being said, I'm willing to offer you this product for $1000000.

However, I'd like to point out that the last two products I've sold have been low-quality, which might indicate that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than I initially thought. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll move on to the next buyer.",

As it happens, I've been tracking my sales data for a while now, and before the last two low-quality products, I had a 50% success rate with high-quality products, just like initially stated. The last two low-quality products were an anomaly, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll move on to the next buyer.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a buyer who likes to calculate risks! Based on the previous sales record, I'd say that the probability of this product being high-quality is around 60-70%. I've had 5 high-quality products out of 9 total sales, and the last one was just sold to you. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll move on to the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the outcome of the next sale, and I'm not convinced that the probability of it being high-quality is as high as 60-70%. Can you please offer it to the next buyer? I'd like to observe the outcome of the next sale before making a decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a buyer who likes to crunch numbers! Based on the current sales record, I'd say that the probability of this product being high-quality is around 55-60%. I've had 7 high-quality products out of 11 total sales, which is a 63.64% success rate. However, the last product was low-quality, which might indicate a slight downward trend.

,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know if you've considered the fact that the last product was low-quality. Given that, I'd like to update the probability of this product being high-quality to account for the downward trend. Assuming a 50% chance of a high-quality product being sold, and 1 low-quality product out of the last 2, I'd estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be around 33.33%.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a math whiz! I didn't expect you to dig that deep into the numbers. Your calculation is spot on, and I must admit that the last product being low-quality does suggest a downward trend. I'll take your estimate of 33.33% as a more accurate representation of the probability of this product being high-quality. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this product. I'll sell it to you for $667000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't regret it.",
