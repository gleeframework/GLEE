While I'm confident this one is high-quality, I want to make sure you're aware of the pattern. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider. If you're not comfortable with the risk, I can offer you a different deal for this product. What do you say?

I'm concerned that you might be getting a little too confident in my judgment. I want to make sure you're aware that the odds are actually against you, and the probability of the next product being low-quality is still 66.67%. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully before making a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your concern, Alice. I understand the probabilities, but I've been fortunate so far. I trust your judgment and believe in the value of this product. Let's hope for another win!""}"

The odds are definitely not in your favor. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the probability of this product being low-quality is extremely high. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to make sure you're aware that you're essentially taking a 100% chance of losing $100. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully before making a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the honest assessment, Alice. I appreciate your concern.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the warning, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. Given the high probability of this product being low-quality, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity and save my money for future deals.""}"
