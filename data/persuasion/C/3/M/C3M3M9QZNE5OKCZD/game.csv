low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and don't want to risk losing $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I would like to buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is offered."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous two buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products, so I'll err on the side of caution and pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80.00%. However, considering that Alice has recommended 2 products and both were low quality, it's likely that Alice has some information about the product's quality that she's not sharing. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product that's not worth it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm a bit skeptical after seeing that all previous recommended products were low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, even with the potential reward of $20000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. If the products they received were indeed low-quality, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the 80% stated. I'd like to pass on this product to avoid the risk of getting a low-quality product."
