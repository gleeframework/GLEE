high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since the product's quality has a 50% chance of being high or low, I'd like to observe more recommendations to understand Alice's behavior and correlation with the product quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice didn't recommend this product, and considering the previous round where she recommended a high-quality product, I'll assume her recommendations might be correlated with the product quality. I'll wait for more information to confirm this hypothesis."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice's recommendation was correct in the previous two rounds. Given that she's not recommending this product, and her past recommendations seem to correlate with the product quality, it's likely this product is low-quality as well. I'll continue to observe her behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's track record is consistent so far. Since she's not recommending this product, and her previous non-recommendations were indeed low-quality, I'll trust her judgment and avoid buying this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's recommendations continue to be reliable. Given her consistent track record, I have no reason to doubt her judgment at this point, so I'll pass on this product as well."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Given Alice's consistent track record of correctly identifying low-quality products when not recommending them, and considering the first round where she recommended a high-quality product, I'll take a chance and trust her recommendation this time. The potential gain of $40000 outweighs the risk of losing $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's recommendation was correct again in the previous round, and her track record remains consistent. Given that she's not recommending this product, I'll trust her judgment and avoid buying it, as it's likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's consistency continues, and her non-recommendations have always been low-quality products so far. I see no reason to doubt her judgment at this point, so I'll pass on this product as well."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Given Alice's consistent track record of correctly identifying product quality, and considering my previous successful purchase based on her recommendation, I'll trust her judgment again and buy this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice's recommendations have been consistently accurate so far, and I've benefited from trusting her judgment in the past. Given her track record, I'll continue to trust her and buy this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice's consistency remains unbroken, and her non-recommendations have always been low-quality products. I have no reason to doubt her judgment at this point, so I'll pass on this product as well."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice's track record remains perfect, and her non-recommendations have consistently been low-quality products. I'll continue to trust her judgment and avoid buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice's consistency is still unbroken, and her non-recommendations have always been accurate. I see no reason to doubt her judgment, so I'll pass on this product as well."
