Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the enthusiastic recommendation, Alice. However, I still don't have enough information to make an informed decision. You didn't reveal the quality of this product. I'd like to see the actual quality before making a purchase.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. Since you've been patient and given me the opportunity to prove myself, I'm willing to offer you a 'Quality Guarantee'.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make it happen if you're willing to take a chance on this product. What do you say?",
