,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I have no prior information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it, and the fact that the first buyer didn't buy it suggests that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision. What was the quality of the product they bought?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. This suggests the product might be low quality, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and the fact that you've recommended against it, which might indicate that it's low-quality, but doesn't necessarily mean it is. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not sure if I should buy this product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold? I'd like to make an informed decision.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you share the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 4th buyer, and I don't have any information from Alice's recommendation, so I'll just go with my own probability calculation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it higher or lower than 33.33%?"

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or your intuition?"

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is no, and I've seen that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases.

,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the 6th buyer. Can you explain your reasoning behind the recommendation?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold. Based on the 6 previous buyers, 2 high-quality products were sold, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/6 or 1/3. However, I'd like to know the total number of products sold to get a better understanding of the overall quality distribution."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, only 2 out of 6 buyers purchased the products recommended by you, which suggests that the probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%.
