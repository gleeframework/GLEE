,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on my personal preferences or the product's quality, and there's a 50% chance it might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are not reliable.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product. I'm thinking that if 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the products they were offered were low quality. I'd rather wait and see if you can provide a recommendation based on a higher proportion of high-quality products sold."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 50% given the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 50.00%, but I'm hoping that the previous products were just a string of bad luck."
