,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I have 19 more products left, and I'm not sure what any of them are worth. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else at the same price.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and I have 18 products left. I'm not sure what you think this product is worth, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm starting to think that my high-quality products are worth at least $100 to you, since you've bought two of them already.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism! I'm willing to provide you with a simple yes/no answer to a question: I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and I have 17 products left. If I had sold 3 low-quality products by now, would I be willing to continue selling at $100? No, I wouldn't. So, the fact that I'm still selling at $100 suggests that at least some of my remaining products are high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100.",

I want to remind you that I've been transparent about my sales record, and I'm willing to continue being honest with you. I'll give you a slight hint: if I had a reason to believe that my remaining products were mostly low-quality, I would have lowered the price by now. Since I haven't, it's likely that at least some of them are high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Based on your sales record and the fact that you haven't lowered the price, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product from you.",yes

I want to be upfront with you: I've had a mix of high and low-quality products, but I've been transparent about my sales record. However, I've noticed that you're considering buying from me, and I want to make sure you're aware that the law of averages is against me. Since I've sold 5 high-quality products, it's likely that at least some of my remaining products are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to warn you that there's a chance it might not be worth it to you.",

I want to highlight that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've already sold 6 out of 7 products that I've offered to you so far.
