,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer for a high-quality product worth at least $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, it will be sold to someone else for the same price. You have no risk, but a potentially huge reward. Make your decision now!",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've just sold a high-quality product for $1000000. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, it will be sold to someone else for the same price. Keep in mind that I've already sold one high-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is now higher than 33.33%. Don't miss out on this opportunity!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the increased probability of it being high-quality after the previous sale.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold two high-quality products in a row. The probability of a product being high-quality has increased significantly. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that the price is non-negotiable. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll be rewarded. But if you're not, I'll just sell it to someone else who is willing to take the chance.",
,,the buyer,3,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll take the chance that it might be high-quality and worth $1250000 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold three high-quality products in a row. You might be thinking that the probability of the next product being high-quality is even higher. But let me tell you, I've been selling products for a while now, and I've sold a total of 3 high-quality products out of 3 attempts. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. Don't get caught up in the streak, think about the odds.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware of the true probability of it being high-quality and will make my decision based on that.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products in total, with 3 of them being high-quality. You might be thinking that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. But I want to remind you that the law of large numbers doesn't apply in this case. The fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row is just a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's not necessarily a better deal than the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 33.33% based on the previous sales record. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that the streak continues.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've seen the pattern, I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and now 2 low-quality products in a row. The streak is broken! Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. Don't get caught up in the streak, think about the odds.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've seen the pattern, I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, followed by 2 low-quality products. Now, it's back to low-quality. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to remind you that the law of large numbers is still not on my side. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Don't let the recent low-quality products sway your decision. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000.",

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the law of large numbers is starting to work in my favor. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. Think about the odds, but also think about the potential reward. It's a risk worth taking, don't you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I believe the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that 5 out of 8 products were high-quality suggests that the probability might be slightly higher than that.
