high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product that hasn't been recommended yet."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that you don't recommend it. Can you provide me with that information?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the prior probability of 50%.
