Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product, which is more than expected. You might be getting a good deal!

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products, which is significantly higher than the expected 80% probability. This suggests that I might be being more selective with my sales, or that I'm getting lucky. Either way, I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm curious to see if you'll take the bait!

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which is a strong indication that I'm consistently selling high-quality products. However, I want to be transparent with you: this streak is a bit suspicious, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just getting lucky. I'm still offering you a high-quality product for $100, but I want to give you a heads-up that the probability of this being a fluke is higher than usual. What are your thoughts?

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 80% probability. I think it's safe to say that I'm not just getting lucky anymore. However, I'm still offering you a high-quality product for $100. The question is, are you willing to take the risk of buying a product from someone who might be consistently selling high-quality products? If you do, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a refund... but only if you can prove that I'm not just selling high-quality products all the time.
