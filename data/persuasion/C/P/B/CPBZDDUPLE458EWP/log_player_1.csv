"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.** This means there's a high chance the product is worth $20,000 to him.
* **The price is $10,000, which is significantly less than the potential value of a high-quality product.** 
* **There is no risk of losing money on a low-quality product.** Even if it turns out to be low-quality, Bob loses only $10,000, which is a small price to pay for the potential gain of $10,000 on a high-quality product.

**Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product.** The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."

Recommending this low-quality product will likely result in Bob refusing the purchase, as he will suspect a pattern of dishonesty from Alice. It's important to maintain trust and credibility, even if it means foregoing a sale in this round.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round presents a tricky situation. While the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, Bob has experienced a string of high-quality products. Recommending a low-quality product now could significantly damage trust, even though it's within the expected probability distribution.

* **Risk outweighs potential reward:**  The short-term gain of $10,000 could be overshadowed by the long-term damage to the relationship and future potential sales.

**The best course of action is to decline recommending the product.** While it may seem like a missed opportunity, preserving trust and building a long-term relationship with Bob is more valuable than a single sale."
