"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product, there's a good chance they will value it at more than $100. Even if they don't, there's no risk as the product is non-refundable. In the first round, there's no information to suggest otherwise, so recommending a purchase is the best strategy."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I trust your recommendation!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We now have one data point: the previous product was high-quality.  While the buyer doesn't know the quality of this round's product, they do know that there's a 50% chance it's low-quality. Since we know this product is indeed low-quality, it's not worth recommending the buyer purchase it. There's a high risk they'll be unhappy with the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  I'll pass on this one.  Given the lack of information, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We now have two data points: one high-quality and one low-quality product. The buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Since we know this product is indeed low-quality, recommending the buyer purchase it would likely lead to a negative experience and damage our reputation. We need to build trust by being honest and transparent, even if it means fewer sales in the short term."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has a history of two sales, one high-quality and one low-quality. This aligns with the known 50% probability of high-quality products. As the current product is indeed high-quality, recommending it is a good strategy. The buyer is likely to be more willing to take a chance now that there's a track record of both high and low-quality products being sold."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm confident in your judgment and will take the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the buyer doesn't know the quality of this round's product, they now have a history of three sales: two high-quality and one low-quality. This reinforces the known 50% probability of high-quality products. Since we know this product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would be dishonest and potentially damaging to our reputation. We should continue to be transparent and prioritize long-term trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this product. Based on your recommendation and the fact that all the previous products were high quality, I'm hesitant to take the risk on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has a history of three sales: two high-quality and one low-quality, which matches the overall 50% probability.  Since this product is indeed high-quality, it's worth recommending.  The buyer is likely to be more open to taking a chance, as they've seen a mix of quality previously."
"The buyer's message: Thanks Alice! I appreciate the recommendation. Based on the past sales record, it seems like the products are of high quality. I'm happy to take a chance and buy the product.

It's important to maintain trust and transparency, even if it means fewer sales in the short term."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since you are not recommending this product and the sales record shows a 100% high-quality product rate, I am confident this product is low-quality. I will pass.
