low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I want to be transparent with you. I'm offering you a product that I wouldn't normally recommend, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.

,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth my money. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. Let me give you a different approach. If I were you, I'd be willing to pay $8000 for a high-quality product like this one. But I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10000. I'm taking a risk by offering it at this price, but I think it's a fair deal considering the quality of the product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're looking for a better value, and I respect your decision to wait. Let me ask you this: if I were to offer you a deal where I give you a 50% refund if the product turns out to be low-quality, would that change your decision? I'm offering this low-quality product for $10000, but I'm willing to take on the risk and give you a partial refund if it doesn't meet your expectations.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're being cautious, and I don't blame you. Let me ask you a question: if I were to tell you that this product is low-quality, but I'm willing to give you a 100% refund if you buy it, would you be willing to take the risk and buy it for $10000? I'm not trying to trick you, I just want to make it clear that I'm willing to take on the risk and give you a full refund if it's not what you're looking for.",
