I've now offered 6 products in total, and 3 have been sold, all of which were high-quality. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000.

However, I'd like to remind you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the law of large numbers suggests that the observed frequency should converge to the true probability as the sample size increases. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000. Considering the value you place on high-quality products, I believe this is a fair price.""

My thought process behind the $9500 offer was to balance the risk of the product being low-quality with the value of a high-quality product. However, I'm willing to listen to your concerns and meet you in the middle. I can offer you a deal: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. This way, you'll get a fair price, and I'll still be able to maintain a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still concerned about the risk of the product being low-quality. Given the statistics, we've had 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, which is a 66.67% success rate. This is lower than the expected 80.00% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to propose a different deal: I'll pay $11000 for the product, which is a premium price that reflects the lower-than-expected success rate.

I believe this price reflects the value of the product and the lower-than-expected success rate. What do you think?""
}"
