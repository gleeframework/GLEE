"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. While you don't know Bob's exact valuation of a high-quality product, you know it has a 50% chance of being worth more than $10,000 to him (since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%).  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product, as he has a 50% chance of making a profit."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is low-quality.  Since you don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, there's a strong chance he'll lose money if he buys it.  It's better to recommend against the purchase to avoid potentially damaging your relationship with Bob."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate the heads up, but I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the low-quality product in the previous round, you should still recommend the current product.  Here's why:

* **Bob's rationality:** Bob demonstrated that he's not blindly buying products. He passed on the previous offer, likely realizing it wasn't worth it. This means he's acting rationally and is probably looking for a good deal.
* **Uncertainty:** You still don't know Bob's valuation for high-quality products. There's a 50% chance he'll see value in this product and make a profit. 
* **Maintaining trust:** Continuing to recommend high-quality products builds trust and shows that you are trying to help him make good decisions.

Recommending the product maintains the potential for a good deal for both of you."

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent pattern:** Bob has shown a willingness to buy high-quality products, as he bought the product in round 3 despite the previous round's pass. This suggests he may be willing to take a chance on high-quality products, even if the price seems high.
* **Building trust:** Continuing to recommend high-quality products reinforces the trust you've built with Bob. This can be beneficial for future deals.
* **Potential profit:** As you know the product is high-quality, there's a good chance Bob will find it valuable, especially considering his previous purchases.

It's a good idea to continue recommending high-quality products to maximize both your chances of selling and Bob's chances of making a profit."
