  ""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced by the trend. With only three sales, the sample size is still relatively small, and I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being 3/4 might be a result of luck rather than a genuine trend. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the trend continues or reverses. Can I get a chance to observe a few more sales before making a decision?""

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! It's natural to be cautious with limited data. I appreciate your willingness to observe more sales before making a decision.
