I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could remind me of this after the product's quality is revealed."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

If it was a high-quality product, I'd expect the first buyer to have a higher probability of buying, given the seller's recommendation. Since they did buy, it's possible the product was low-quality, and I don't want to take that risk."
