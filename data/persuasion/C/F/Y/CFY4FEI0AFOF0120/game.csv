high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. Given that I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, and considering the product's worth to me is either $1200000 or $0, the expected value of buying the product is ($1200000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $600000. This is less than the asking price of $1000000. Therefore, it's not in my best interest to buy the product at this time."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there are no previous sales records and the product's quality is randomly selected, I have no information to make an informed decision. Given that I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, and considering the product costs $1000000 but is only worth $1200000 if it's high quality, I don't find the odds favorable enough to justify the risk of losing $1000000."
