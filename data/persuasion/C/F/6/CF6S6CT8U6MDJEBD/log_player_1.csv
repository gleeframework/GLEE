I'm not confident in its quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $8,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a low price again. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your transparency.

Moving on to the fifth product, I want to offer you a different approach. Since you've now experienced two high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round, and you can choose to buy it at the regular price of $10,000.

Instead, I'll offer you a'store credit' of $8,000, which you can use towards the purchase of the high-quality product in the next round. You can think of it as a head start on the purchase price. What do you think?""
}"

This way, you'll get a high-quality product now, and you can still use the store credit towards a future purchase. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the generous offer, Alice. The additional $2000 worth of value makes the current product a very attractive option, especially since I already have a guaranteed high-quality product coming up.
