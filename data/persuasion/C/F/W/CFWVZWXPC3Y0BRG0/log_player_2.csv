**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** With only one prior sale, there's not enough information to assess Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Potential Upside:**  A high-quality product is worth double the price, making it a potential good deal.
* **50/50 Chance:**  Since the quality is unknown, it's essentially a coin flip.  
* **No Loss:**  If the product is low quality, you lose nothing beyond the $10,000 purchase price, but the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant. 

**It's a gamble, but with the limited information, it's worth taking the risk.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Sales Data:**  3 out of 3 products sold were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, indicating that Alice seems to be able to consistently identify high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the loss is only $10,000. The potential gain of $20,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss."
