Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering a new product, and I want to be transparent with you. In the previous round, the product was high-quality, but the buyer chose not to purchase it. This means my current sales record is 0 sales, with 1 high-quality product offered. I'm eager to make a sale, but I want to remind you that there's a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. Consider this information when making your decision. The price remains $1000000. Will you take the chance?
