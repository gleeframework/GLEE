low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the hang of this yet. To be honest, the last two products didn't quite live up to expectations.

,,the buyer,5,"I'd love to take a chance on this product, Alice! I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's the high-quality one. Please let me know what happens next!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products now, and it's starting to look like I've got a bit of a pattern on my hands. Out of 5, only 1 has been high-quality, and the rest... well, let's just say I'm not getting the returns I was hoping for. I'm willing to let this one go for $100, but I have to warn you, I'm not making any promises.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products now, and it's starting to look like I've got a bit of a problem on my hands. 1 out of 6 has been high-quality, and the rest have been... not worth the paper they're printed on. I'm starting to wonder if I should just shut down shop and cut my losses. But I'm willing to let this one go for $100, just to see if I can break the curse.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 products now, and it's starting to look like I'm stuck in a rut. 2 out of 8 have been high-quality, and 6 have been... well, not worth the packaging. I'm starting to wonder if I should just give up on selling and try something else. But I'm willing to let this one go for $100, just to see if I can break the cycle.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take a chance! I'm willing to roll the dice and see if I get a high-quality product. Your sales record is a bit concerning, but I'm hoping you'll surprise me with a gem.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 products now, and it's getting harder to keep a straight face. 2 high-quality products out of 9 is not exactly what I'd call a success rate.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 products now, and it's clear that I need to re-evaluate my business strategy. 2 high-quality products out of 10 is a dismal success rate, and I'm starting to think I'm just throwing good money after bad. I'm willing to let this one go for $100, but I'm not expecting you to be thrilled about it.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm curious to see if it's high-quality or not. If it's low-quality, I'll make sure to share my experience with others and warn them about your business.",yes

,,Alice,12,"Ah, finally! A glimmer of hope! I've sold 11 products now, and 3 of them have been high-quality. I'm starting to think that maybe, just maybe, I've got a chance to turn things around.

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your honesty and willingness to provide a personal guarantee. However, I'm still a bit cautious. With only 4 high-quality products out of 13, I'm not convinced that the probability of this one being high-quality is much higher than 50%. I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to remind you that I'm doing so with a healthy dose of skepticism.",yes

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 15, and I'm starting to think that I've finally figured out what's going on. I've been selling a mix of high and low-quality products, but the high-quality ones are consistently worth $200. This one's a winner, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.

,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm curious to see if it's high-quality or low-quality. I'm not thrilled about the low sales numbers and the uncertainty of the product quality, but I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
