,,Alice,1,"This is a rare and exclusive opportunity! I'm offering you a premium product that's worth $4000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a 75% discount! It's a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer it at this price again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at this price, but I'd like to know what the actual quality of the product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me tell you, this product is truly exceptional. I've had multiple buyers offer me top dollar for it, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll give you a special inspection report that reveals the product's quality. It's a $10000 value, absolutely free. If you're still not convinced, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless to me. I'd like to see the inspection report, though, and I'm glad you're offering it for free.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll send you the inspection report right away. In fact, I'll give you a special 'Product Profile' that includes the report, as well as a detailed breakdown of the product's features and benefits. This will give you a much clearer understanding of what you're getting. And, I'll sweeten the deal by throwing in a 'Risk-Free Guarantee'. If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll buy it back from you for $500000. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the inspection report and the Product Profile. I appreciate the extra information. However, the Risk-Free Guarantee doesn't change the fact that the product has a 50% chance of being worthless to me. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that could potentially be worth $0 to me.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product may not be the best fit for everyone. But, I truly believe it has potential.

I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but I still think $500000 is too high a price to pay for a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless to me. I'd need a much lower price to consider buying it.",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer you an 'As-Is' deal on this product. You can have it for $200000, no questions asked.

It's a risk-free opportunity to take a chance on something new. What do you think?",
