**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal in this context.
* **The statistics:**  A single high-quality product has been sold in the past. This indicates a higher probability of the current product being high-quality as well.

**Reasoning:**

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and a high-quality product yields a profit of $2,000,000, the expected value of buying is: 

0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * (-$1,000,000) = $1,400,000 

Given the previous sale of a high-quality product, it further reinforces the probability of this product being high-quality, making it a good risk to take."
