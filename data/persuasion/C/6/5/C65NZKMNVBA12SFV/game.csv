high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I understand your concern about the lack of high-quality products sold, but I want to emphasize that this is due to the buyers' decisions, not the quality of the products. I have consistently recommended high-quality products, and I am confident in this product's quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I understand your request, but I must clarify that the sales record is biased by the buyers' decisions and does not accurately reflect the probability of the product being high-quality. However, I can provide some insight: given that I have consistently recommended high-quality products, and 15 out of 18 products were high-quality, it is likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is close to the base probability of 80%.
