low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. This makes me suspect that the product might be low-quality, which aligns with her recommendation. I'm hoping to exploit this information and get a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and I'm trying to exploit the asymmetry of information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products are mostly low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her observations of previous buyers, and since 0 high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because of the low price of $10000, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far were all low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product and no high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice has left are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all the products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the prior probability. I'd like to see if the next product is high-quality before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and what led you to recommend not buying this product?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion. I'd rather wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the current sales record before making a decision."
