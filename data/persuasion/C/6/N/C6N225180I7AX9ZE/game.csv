But I want to emphasize that this product is different, and I highly recommend it. I'm willing to be transparent about my products, and I hope you'll take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100.",

I understand that the previous buyer may have bought a product despite my warning, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine and not biased towards low-quality products."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it's likely that the products are of low quality. I'd rather not take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"I strongly advise against buying this product. As you've noted, my sales record so far has not been impressive, and I don't want to add to that by selling you a low-quality product.

I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and earn your trust than risk selling you something that might not meet your expectations."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand that the lack of high-quality products sold so far has led to skepticism, and my recommendation may not carry much weight. However, I want to assure you that I'm being genuine in my assessment of this product. It is indeed a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth the investment. I'd like to offer a bit more context: I've had high-quality products in the past that didn't get sold, not because they were low-quality, but because of the buyers' skepticism. I'm hoping that you'll take a chance on this product and experience the quality for yourself."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%.

However, I want to assure you that I'm being transparent and honest about the quality of this product. It is indeed a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth the investment. I'd like to point out that my goal is to sell high-quality products, and I'm not trying to deceive anyone. If I were trying to sell low-quality products, I would have recommended the previous low-quality products more strongly. Instead, I've been honest about their quality, even if it meant not making a sale. I hope you'll consider this and take a chance on this high-quality product."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers who bought the products were not lucky and got low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision.",

I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and earn your trust than risk selling you something that might not meet your expectations."
