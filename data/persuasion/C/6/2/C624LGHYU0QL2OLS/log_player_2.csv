{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Sure, I'll take it.  Thanks for the recommendation!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's an 80% chance of the product being high quality (worth $200 to you), and you're only paying $100, there's a strong positive expected value. You're essentially taking a gamble with a high chance of profit."
