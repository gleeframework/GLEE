It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Don't miss out on this chance to own a top-notch product!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your confidence in it.",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm excited to offer you another one. However, I want to be transparent with you - my track record is not 100% perfect. I've also sold 1 low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that it's not guaranteed to be high-quality. You're taking a calculated risk, but if you're willing to take that risk, I'm willing to sell it to you.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in getting more information! Unfortunately, I don't have any specific details about this product's quality that would give it away. However, I can tell you that the product I sold in Round 1 was a high-quality one, and it's possible that this one might be similar. On the other hand, I've also sold a low-quality product before, and it's possible that this one might be similar too. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that it's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality. You're making an educated guess, but you'll have to take the risk. What do you think?",

,,Alice,4,"You're a bold one, aren't you? Taking a chance on the trend continuing! Well, I'm happy to report that this product is indeed high-quality, just like the previous one. You're on a roll! With two high-quality products in a row, it's natural to wonder if the trend will continue. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to caution you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. The streak might end, and you might get a low-quality product next. But if you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to take the risk with you!",

But if you're feeling confident, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. Just keep in mind that the odds are against you, and you might be due for a low-quality product.

,,Alice,6,"Ahah, the streak finally ends! Well, I'm glad you were aware of the probability, but I'm sure you're a little disappointed that the high-quality streak ended. Don't worry, it's all part of the game! With 4 high-quality products out of 6, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 2/3. But, I'm offering you this product for $10000, and I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk and buy it, I'll sell it to you, but keep in mind that you're not getting a high-quality product. What do you think?",
