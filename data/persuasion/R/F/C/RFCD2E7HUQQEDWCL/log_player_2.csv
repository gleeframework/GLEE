Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm excited to offer you another one. However, I want to be transparent with you - my track record is not 100% perfect. I've also sold 1 low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that it's not guaranteed to be high-quality. You're taking a calculated risk, but if you're willing to take that risk, I'm willing to sell it to you.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in getting more information! Unfortunately, I don't have any specific details about this product's quality that would give it away. However, I can tell you that the product I sold in Round 1 was a high-quality one, and it's possible that this one might be similar. On the other hand, I've also sold a low-quality product before, and it's possible that this one might be similar too. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that it's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality. You're making an educated guess, but you'll have to take the risk. What do you think?

Alice's message: You're a bold one, aren't you? Taking a chance on the trend continuing! Well, I'm happy to report that this product is indeed high-quality, just like the previous one. You're on a roll! With two high-quality products in a row, it's natural to wonder if the trend will continue. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to caution you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. The streak might end, and you might get a low-quality product next. But if you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to take the risk with you!
