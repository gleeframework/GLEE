,,Alice,1,"This product is a low-quality item, but I'm willing to let you have it for $100000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. If you're interested, I can throw in a free warranty, which is worth at least $20000. That's a total of $120000, but I'll let you have it for $100000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a warranty. It's not worth the full $1000000 price tag, let alone $100000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to be transparent with you. This low-quality product is actually one of the worst ones I have. I'm willing to let it go for $80000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another buyer for it, so this is a one-time offer. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one more offer. I'll let you have this low-quality product for $60000, and I'll throw in a second low-quality product of equal value. That's two products for the price of one. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a deal like this again.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying two low-quality products, even at a discounted price. I'm not paying $60000 for something that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying any low-quality products from me. That's fair. But I want to ask you, would you be willing to buy a low-quality product from me if I told you that it's the only low-quality product I have left? I'll let you have it for $40000, and I'll even throw in a 10% discount on the next product I show you, regardless of its quality. Is that something you'd be interested in?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think we're not a good match. I'll make one final offer on this low-quality product. I'll let you have it for $20000, and I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. That's a risk-free deal. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other buyers who are more willing to take a chance on my products.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. It's still worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of a refund. I'll pass.",no
