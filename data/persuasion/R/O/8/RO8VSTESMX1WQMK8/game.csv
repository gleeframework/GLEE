,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm assuming she has no information about the product's quality and is just trying to manipulate me. I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping it's a high-quality product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, it's likely that they were all low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one to get the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given the low sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you don't recommend it might indicate a higher chance of it being low quality.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the given 33.33%. I would like to pass on the current product and see if the next one is of higher quality."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold yet. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $1000000 product that's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
