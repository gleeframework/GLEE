,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can guarantee it's a high-quality one. Can you provide some information about the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%, and I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not influenced by your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced based on the previous sales record, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my mind. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool of products is likely higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a product that hasn't been recommended to buy yet, or for more information about the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the previous products sold were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are accurate. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the current product."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on previous sales data, and I'm not sure if it's a high-quality or low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk, as the expected value of a high-quality product is $400, which is higher than the price of $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since you've recommended against it, I'll pass. However, I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'll pass on it."
