Alice's message: You're the third buyer in a row to take the plunge! I appreciate your confidence. However, I want to be transparent with you - the previous two buyers didn't get a high-quality product. I'm not saying this one is definitely low-quality, but I do want to give you a heads up. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: Three for three, unfortunately. I want to be upfront with you - the last three buyers have not been lucky. I'm starting to think that my success rate might be lower than 33.33%.

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund... if you can find a buyer who's willing to pay $1000000 for it.

Alice's message: Four low-quality products in a row... I'm starting to wonder if I should just lower the price. But I'm a professional, and I believe in the value of my products. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it. Keep in mind that this is still a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.
