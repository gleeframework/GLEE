,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on your previous sales record, I notice that 5 buyers have passed on the products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. Given your recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to believe that this product might be low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better luck."
