low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as there's no prior information to go by."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your recommendation alone, especially since none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next product turns out."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). Alice's recommendation is likely biased by the fact that she has already sold one product, and that product was low-quality. I will pass on this product and wait for more information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me if I were to buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low number of sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better offer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is suspicious, and I don't want to be the one to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can get a good deal."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a 20% discount from the original price of $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the overall 80% probability. I'd like to wait for a different product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have already passed on the products, which suggests that the products might be low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it seems like the products being offered are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely the product is low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations, since you don't know the value of the product to me. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's a high-quality product."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold, it suggests that the previous buyers may have been misled by Alice's recommendations. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice has recommended a product to me, I'm concerned that this might be a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
