"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product other than Alice's recommendation, and the potential reward ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0), it's in your best interest to buy the product. This is a gamble, but given the odds and potential payoff, it's the logical choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the info, Alice. I appreciate you being honest. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now a piece of information. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it's likely she has a hunch the product is low quality. Even though there's still a chance it's high quality, the odds are heavily against it, and the potential loss ($100) outweighs the potential reward ($125). It's safer to pass."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation reinforces the idea that she believes the product is likely low quality. Although there's still a chance it could be high quality, it's more likely that the product is worth nothing to you. Given the potential loss of $100, it's still safer to pass."

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation has been consistently wrong for the past two rounds, it's important to remember that each product is a new, independent draw. The past doesn't guarantee the future. 

Since Alice now recommends the product, and you know a high-quality product is worth $125 to you, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss.  There's always a chance she's wrong, but taking the gamble is still the better option."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation history is now a significant factor. Despite her occasional incorrect guesses, she's been right more often than not, and her lack of recommendation suggests she believes this product is likely low quality.

```
