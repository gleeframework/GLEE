It's a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of our sales, and who knows, you might be the one to break the streak of high-quality products! What do you say? Will you take the chance and join our growing list of customers?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the chance of buying a low-quality product for $10000. Can I get a better understanding of the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data?",no

With 2 high-quality products out of 5 sold, the probability of the remaining products being low-quality is actually higher than 40%. If I assume that the sales record is representative of the overall product quality, then the probability of the current product being low-quality is around 44.44%.
