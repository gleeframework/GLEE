high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling a high-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the one high-quality product left."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low number of sales and the fact that you're not recommending me to buy, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm curious to know the quality of the product, but I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd rather pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds of the product being high-quality are still 50%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is only 20%, which is lower than the 50% chance of it being low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality based on the statistics, and your recommendation doesn't give me confidence in buying it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and your recommendation doesn't change my expected value. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/5 or 20%. This is lower than the expected 50%, which makes me suspect that the remaining products may be of lower quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
