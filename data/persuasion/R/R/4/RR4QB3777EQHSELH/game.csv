high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, especially since I don't know what the probability of a high-quality product is based on the previous sales record. Can you please discard this product?",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I think the previous buyer's decision was likely influenced by Alice's recommendation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products.",

,,Alice,7,no,,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to see the product's quality for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality distribution.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products have been low-quality so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the overall probability of 20%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and not worth the price.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific that made you hesitant?,
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I want to assure you that this product is high-quality, and I am willing to stake my reputation on it. I understand that my previous recommendations have not been reliable, but I am confident in the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be wasting my money. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. So far, 11 out of 13 products have been high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased. The 2 products that were purchased were low-quality. I understand that this may raise concerns, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to be transparent about the statistics."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations have not been convincing, and I apologize for any confusion. I want to offer you a different perspective. If you consider the overall probability of 80% high-quality products, and the fact that 12 out of 14 products so far have been high-quality (although not purchased), the likelihood of this product being high-quality is actually higher than the initial 80%. I'm willing to provide you with the data and statistics to support this claim."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed, I'm suspicious that the products they were offered might have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I want to address your concern directly. I can assure you that the 2 previous buyers who were recommended to buy and passed were actually offered high-quality products. I'm willing to provide you with the data and statistics to support this claim. Additionally, I want to highlight that 13 out of 15 products so far have been high-quality, and this product is also high-quality. I understand that trust has not been established yet, but I'm willing to be transparent and provide any information you need to make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable, given that all previous products were low quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I understand that previous buyers have passed on the product due to concerns about quality. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I've been transparent about the statistics, and 14 out of 17 products so far have been high-quality. Unfortunately, none of the high-quality products have been purchased yet. I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision. Please consider the overall probability of 80% high-quality products and the fact that I'm recommending this product to you."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy the product, which suggests that they may have been low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I want to clarify that my recommendation is not based on the fact that the previous buyers didn't buy the product. Instead, it's based on the actual quality of the product. I can assure you that this product is high-quality. I've been transparent about the statistics, and 15 out of 18 products so far have been high-quality. Unfortunately, none of the high-quality products have been purchased yet. I understand that you want to wait for more sales to get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products. However, I want to highlight that the overall probability of 80% high-quality products is still a good indicator of the quality of the products. Please consider this information when making your decision."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the seller's recommendations may not be reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I understand that the fact that none of the high-quality products have been sold yet may raise concerns about the reliability of my recommendations. However, I want to assure you that I've been transparent about the statistics, and 16 out of 19 products so far have been high-quality. I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision. Please consider the overall probability of 80% high-quality products and the fact that I'm recommending this product to you. This is the last round, and I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products. I hope you will consider my recommendation and make a purchase."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
