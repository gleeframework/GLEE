low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information to go on. I'll just have to take my chances."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's high quality based on your previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think you're trying to discourage me with your recommendation. I'll take a chance!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that previous buyers have passed on it makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not sure I trust Alice's recommendations so far. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and they didn't find high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and if there's any change in the odds of the product being high quality after I pass."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation and both products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if I can get more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's likely to be low-quality given Alice's recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to know the quality of the product after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will be more interested.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm going to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. If I buy the product, I'll be giving up the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product that might be sold to the next buyer, who might not be as informed as I am about the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your past recommendations have been 0 for 3, which suggests a high probability of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. If it's less than 50%, I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products has been underestimated. If I were to buy, I'd be overpaying for a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different.
