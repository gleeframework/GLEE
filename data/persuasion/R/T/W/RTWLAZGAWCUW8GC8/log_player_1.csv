It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. What do you say?""}"

I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you say?""}"

With 4 high-quality products out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80%, but that also means there's a 20% chance it's low-quality.

With 4 high-quality products sold out of 5 total products sold, and now a low-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'm willing to be upfront with you: the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 4/6 or approximately 66.67%. I'm still offering it to you for $1,000,000. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. What do you say?""}"

"The buyer's message: I'd like to decline the offer. I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is 71.43% as you claim. I'd like to know the actual probability based on the 5 high-quality products sold out of 6 total products sold, which is 5/6 or approximately 83.33%. I'd like to know the probability of the product being low-quality, which is 1/6 or approximately 16.67%. I'd also like to know the expected value of buying the product, which is (83.33% * $1200000) + (16.67% * $0) = $1000000. However, since you're offering a refund for a low-quality product, the effective price is $1000000 - (16.67% * $1000000) = $833333. I'd like to buy the product at this price.

I'll tell you that I'll match the effective price you calculated: $833,333. I'll sell it to you at that price. No need to haggle, you've already done the math!""}"

However, I want to acknowledge that the previous buyer's purchase was a smart move, and I'm willing to offer you a better deal. I'll sell it to you for $833,333, just like the previous buyer got it for. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?""}"
