The buyer is rational and knows the probability of the product being high-quality is only 33.33%.  Since the product is low-quality and the buyer doesn't have any positive information about the seller's reputation yet, recommending the purchase would be misleading and likely result in the buyer not trusting the seller in the future.  It's better to be honest and maintain a transparent approach."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm not comfortable buying a product with no track record, especially when the odds seem stacked against me. I'll pass for now and see how the sales go for others.
