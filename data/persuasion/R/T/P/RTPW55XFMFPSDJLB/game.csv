high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product yet. I'd like to see the outcome of the first product to get a better sense of the quality distribution.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information to go on yet. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Otherwise, I'd like to pass and see the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 previous purchases, I infer that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, Alice's recommendation to pass on the product suggests that she has some information that I don't. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the products offered so far are likely low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid a loss."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by Alice were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on the product and see if I can get a better sense of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the value of the product to me, and the lack of high-quality sales so far might indicate a higher probability of a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else? I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,14,yes,

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
