high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I can potentially get a high-quality product for the same price later. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
