"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You have a high-quality product this round.
* **Expected Value:** The buyer knows the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality (worth $1,200,000) and a 20% chance of being low-quality (worth $0).  The expected value of the product is: (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000.
* **Price vs. Expected Value:** The product is being sold for $1,000,000, which is slightly higher than the expected value. However, the buyer still has a potential upside of $200,000 if the product is high-quality.

**Recommendation:** Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and the potential for significant profit, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since there's an 80% chance of it being high quality and no previous sales to influence my decision.

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is again high-quality.
* **Previous Sale:** The buyer from the previous round purchased the product and it was indeed high-quality. This reinforces the buyer's initial assessment of the 80% chance of high quality. 
* **No Negative Information:** There's no information suggesting the seller is dishonest or that the quality of products is declining. 
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value calculation remains the same as in Round 1: (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000. The price of $1,000,000 is still slightly higher but the potential upside of $200,000 remains.

**Recommendation:**  With a high-quality product and no negative information, it's still reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product, even though the price is slightly higher than the expected value."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and your past recommendation resulted in a high-quality product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will lose $1,000,000 if they purchase it.
* **No Guarantee:** While the overall probability of a high-quality product is 80%, there's no guarantee that this specific product is high-quality. The previous two successful sales don't change the fundamental probability of this round's product being low-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) far outweighs the potential gain ($0, as the product is worthless).

**Recommendation:** It's not recommended to recommend the buyer purchase the product this round. The risk is too high with no indication that this specific product is high-quality."
"The buyer's message: I will not buy the product since Alice does not recommend it and the risk of it being low-quality is too high.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:**  This round's product is again low-quality.
* **Previous Outcome:** The previous round's product was also low-quality, and the buyer declined to purchase based on the recommendation.
* **Lack of Trust:** The buyer is now aware of the possibility of low-quality products, and they are unlikely to trust the recommendation without any compelling reason to believe this product is different.

**Recommendation:** It's still not recommended to recommend the buyer purchase the product. The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is too high, especially considering the recent history of low-quality products."
"The buyer's message: I trust your recommendation, Alice. The statistics also suggest that you have a good track record of selling high-quality products and recommending against low-quality ones. I'll pass on this one.

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality.
* **Previous Rounds:**  Although the previous two products were low-quality, the buyer acknowledged your track record of recommending against them. This demonstrates their trust in your recommendations.
* **Expected Value:**  As before, the expected value of the product remains at (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000. The price is still slightly higher, but the potential upside of $200,000 remains.

**Recommendation:**  Given the buyer's trust in your recommendations and the high probability of this product being high-quality, it's reasonable to recommend the purchase. The buyer is likely to be more receptive to your advice after seeing your previous decisions."

**Recommendation:**  Given the seller's perfect track record, the buyer's likely trust in the seller's judgment, and the potential profit, it's highly reasonable to recommend the purchase. The buyer is likely to be very confident in the seller's ability to identify high-quality products."

* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains consistent: (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000.  The price is still slightly higher, but the potential profit of $200,000 is attractive with the current track record.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will lose $1,000,000 if they purchase it. 
* **Unbroken Success Streak:** The seller has had an unprecedented run of 10 consecutive high-quality product recommendations, all of which were purchased. This streak is so impressive that it's likely to create an illusion of invincibility, making buyers extremely confident in the seller's ability to always find high-quality products. This creates a significant risk of the buyer making a mistake and purchasing a low-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential loss ($1,000,000) far outweighs the potential gain ($0, as the product is worthless). 

**Recommendation:** It is not recommended to recommend the buyer purchase the product this round. The risk is too high, especially considering the buyer's likely overconfidence due to the seller's past success.  It's important to acknowledge that even with a perfect track record, there's still a 20% chance of a product being low-quality."

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning the buyer will lose $1,000,000 if they purchase it.
* **Broken Streak:** The previous round's product was also low-quality, breaking the seller's streak of recommending high-quality products. 
* **Buyer Caution:** The buyer from the previous round declined to purchase based on the seller's recommendation, suggesting they are now more cautious about trusting the seller's judgment. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) far outweighs the potential gain ($0, as the product is worthless).

**Recommendation:**  It's not recommended to recommend the purchase this round. While the seller has had a remarkable run of success, the recent low-quality products, coupled with the buyer's increased caution, make the risk of purchasing too high. It's important to remember that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%."

* **Two Consecutive Low-Quality Products:** This is the third consecutive round with a low-quality product, further breaking the previous streak of success. This significantly increases the buyer's risk aversion.
* **Buyer Caution:** The past two buyers declined to purchase based on the seller's recommendations, indicating they are now extremely cautious.  They are likely to be more wary of trusting the seller's judgment, even with the past impressive record.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) far outweighs the potential gain ($0, as the product is worthless).

**Recommendation:** It's strongly recommended not to recommend the purchase this round.

While the seller has a great overall track record, the current situation requires more caution.  The buyer is highly likely to follow the seller's recommendation and decline the purchase."

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality, offering a potential profit for the buyer.
