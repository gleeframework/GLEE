Would you like to buy the current product?","The probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but Alice does not recommend buying the product. This is a classic problem of asymmetric information and signaling. Given Alice's recommendation, I need to update my beliefs about the probability of the product being high-quality.\n\nLet's assume that Alice recommends buying a product if and only if it is high-quality. If she recommends not buying, it could be either because the product is low-quality (with probability 1) or because she made a mistake (with some small probability). Given that 12 out of 12 sold products were high-quality, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are accurate.\n\nHowever, since Alice does not recommend buying, I should be cautious. The fact that she doesn't recommend it strongly suggests that the product might be low-quality. I will update my prior belief of 80% to a lower probability, say 20% (though this is a rough estimate).\n\nWith this updated belief, the expected value of buying the product is:\n\n(0.2 x $1,200,000) + (0.8 x $0) = $240,000\n\nSince the price is $1,000,000, buying the product would result in an expected loss of $760,000.\n\nTherefore, I will decide not to buy the product.\n\n{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't trust your recommendation, Alice. The risk is too high.""}"
