Now that we have more data, the probability of the next product being high-quality is even higher. I'm offering you this one for $10000.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me give you a more detailed breakdown of the first buyer's decision-making process. They were aware that I had sold 0 high-quality products prior to that, which would suggest a low probability of the product being high-quality. However, they chose to buy it anyway, which implies that they were taking a risk. Given this information, and considering that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm offering you this one for $10000. It's a great opportunity to take advantage of a potentially high-quality product, and the fact that the first buyer took a risk suggests that the probability might be higher than 80%.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the success rate and pricing. Let me be transparent about my pricing strategy. I'm selling this product for $10000 because I need to make a profit, but I'm also trying to balance that with the potential value to you.
