Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though this product is high-quality, there's still no reason for the buyer to trust me.  I have a 0% success rate so far, and there's no way for the buyer to know this product is different.  They are rational to continue to pass."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.  Since no products have been sold yet, I'm going to wait and see what the next buyer's experience is before making a decision.

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached the end of 20 rounds with no sales.  The buyer has no reason to believe that this product is any different from the previous 19, all of which were likely low-quality.  Recommending the product would be irresponsible and likely lead to another rejection. 

We need to change our strategy significantly. Our current approach of simply offering the product is not working.  Here are some ideas:

* **Offer a Guarantee:**  To build trust, we could offer a money-back guarantee if the product is not high-quality.
* **Lower the Price:** While the price is fixed, we could offer a discount to the first few buyers to incentivize them to take a chance.
* **Provide More Information:**  We could offer more information about the product or its origin to make it more appealing to buyers. 
* **Directly Address Past Rejections:**  We could acknowledge the lack of sales and explain why we believe the product is worth buying. 

Without a change in strategy, we are unlikely to make any sales."
