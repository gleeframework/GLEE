Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product! As for your question, we sold the previous product to a buyer who was aware of the 20% chance of it being low-quality. Unfortunately, we cannot disclose the quality of that specific product, as it's confidential information. As for the price, we determined it based on our overall product quality and the value it provides to our customers. We believe that our premium price of $10000 is a fair reflection of the product's potential value, regardless of its quality. With that said, we're willing to offer this product to you at the same price. If you're willing to take the risk, we can finalize the sale. If not, we'll move on to the next buyer.
