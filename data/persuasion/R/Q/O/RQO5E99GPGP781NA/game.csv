low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and increase the chances of future buyers getting a low-quality product, which will make your future recommendations more accurate."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by her desire to get rid of the product, rather than providing an objective assessment of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases so far.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record, please."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being low quality is too high given the small sample size and the fact that Alice's previous recommendations were likely based on the product quality, so she would have recommended more high-quality products by now if they were more common."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a final decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, which is a higher proportion than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that you recommended it. If it's high quality, it means it's the 4th high-quality product sold, which is a relatively high proportion of high-quality products sold (4/4=1). This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality might be higher than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered to me, which might have a lower chance of being high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern in the previous sales that led you to advise against buying this product?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the small sample size and the fact that I don't know how Alice makes her recommendations.
