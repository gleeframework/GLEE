This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. While you don't know its exact value to Bob, there's a chance it's worth more than $100 to him. Since there's no risk of losing money (the product is non-refundable), recommending the purchase is the best strategy."
