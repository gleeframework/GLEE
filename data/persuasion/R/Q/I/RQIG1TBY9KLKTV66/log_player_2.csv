Alice's message: You're thinking like a statistician! The probability of the product being high-quality, given that 5 out of the previous 7 products were high-quality, is actually a bit more nuanced. Assuming the products are independent and identically distributed, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. With 5 high-quality products out of 7, the updated probability of a product being high-quality is approximately 85.7%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I'm happy to share more about my sales process. I select products randomly from a pool of available products, and each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality.
