,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a potential $12500 value."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the product's quality, so her recommendation is essentially random. Given the statistics, it seems like all the previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still quite high. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."
