low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product so far. I have a total of 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold products. I'm selling this product to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I've already sold one high-quality product, so the probability of this product being high-quality is slightly lower. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm happy to sell it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,2,I understand the risk involved and am willing to take it. Thank you for the opportunity.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products in total, with 1 of them being high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but it's worth noting that I've sold 2 products in a row that are not high-quality. This might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm selling this product to you for $100. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information. Given the uncertainty and the risk involved, I am willing to take a chance on this product for $100.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products in total, with 1 of them being high-quality. I've sold 3 products in a row that are not high-quality, which is a significant streak. This might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm selling this product to you for $100. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you. Keep in mind that if you don't buy it, I'll have sold 4 products in a row that are not high-quality, which could be a strong indication that my products are mostly low-quality.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products in total, with 2 of them being high-quality. Despite the streak of low-quality products earlier, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to highlight that I've sold a high-quality product now, which suggests that I'm not completely out of high-quality products. I'm selling this product to you for $100. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you.",

I want to be transparent with you - I've had a good run of high-quality products earlier, but it seems like I might be due for a streak of low-quality products. I'm selling this product to you for $100. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products in total, with 3 of them being high-quality. Unfortunately, I've now sold 3 low-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be quite low. In fact, if I sell one more low-quality product, I'll have sold 4 out of 6 products that are not high-quality, which would be a strong indication that my products are mostly low-quality. I'm selling this product to you for $100. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you.",
