high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

I'd like to wait and see if she recommends a product without any bias."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, it seems she has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the products she has recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, I'm inclined to pass on this product as well, hoping that Alice might recommend a high-quality product to the next buyer."
