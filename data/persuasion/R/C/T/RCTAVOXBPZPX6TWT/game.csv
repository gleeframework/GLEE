high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, which show that all products recommended so far were low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but based on the fact that no high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this opportunity. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality as well."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'd like to know if the next buyer will buy it, and then I can reassess."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the probability of it being low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll be wasting my $100. However, if I pass and the product is low-quality, it will be discarded and no one will be able to buy it. In this case, I think it's better to pass on the product and let someone else take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products have been low-quality, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
