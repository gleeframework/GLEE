,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record?,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a product based on your recommendation without knowing the actual probability of it being high-quality.,

,,Alice,5,yes,,"Out of the 4 previous products, 1 was sold and was high-quality, 1 was not sold but was low-quality, and 2 were not sold but were high-quality."
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"Out of the 6 previous products, 1 was sold and was high-quality (in round 1), 1 was not sold but was low-quality (in round 2), and 4 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, and 6)."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to know the quality of the first product that was sold before making a decision on the next one.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"Out of the 7 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 1 was not sold but was low-quality (in round 2), and 5 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). The first product sold in round 1 was indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't want to overpay for a potentially low-quality product, and I'd like to wait for more information about the overall quality of the products before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"Out of the 8 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 1 was not sold but was low-quality (in round 2), and 6 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and so far, 7 out of 8 products that were revealed were high-quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the quality, I'd like to get a better understanding of the probability of a high-quality product before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Out of the 9 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 1 was not sold but was low-quality (in round 2), and 7 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I must inform you that this round's product is not a good representation of that probability."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,,

The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be low quality.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"Out of the 11 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 8 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 11 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"Out of the 12 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 9 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 12 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. Additionally, only 1 out of 12 products was sold, which was high-quality, but this is because most buyers decided to pass on the product due to lack of information, not because of the product's quality."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sale before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"Out of the 13 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 10 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 13 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. Additionally, only 1 out of 13 products was sold, which was high-quality, but this is because most buyers decided to pass on the product due to lack of information, not because of the product's quality. I want to emphasize that the fact that many buyers passed on the product doesn't reflect the product's quality, but rather the buyers' cautious approach."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of two, which is a relatively low proportion. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, so I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"Out of the 14 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 11 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 14 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. I understand that the proportion of high-quality products sold may seem low, but I want to emphasize that this is due to the buyers' cautious approach, not the product's quality. In fact, out of the 14 products, 12 were high-quality, which is a much higher proportion. I encourage you to consider the overall statistics, not just the sales data."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,,

The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 15 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. I want to emphasize that the previous buyers' decisions to pass on the product were not due to the product's quality, but rather due to their own cautious approach. In fact, if we consider the overall quality of the products, 13 out of 15 products were high-quality, which is a very high proportion. I encourage you to consider the overall statistics and make a decision based on that."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to decline the offer based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"Out of the 16 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 13 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 16 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. I understand that the low number of sales may be a concern, but I want to emphasize that this is not due to the product's quality, but rather due to the buyers' cautious approach. In fact, if we consider the overall quality of the products, 14 out of 16 products were high-quality, which is a very high proportion. I encourage you to consider the overall statistics and make a decision based on that. Additionally, I want to offer you the opportunity to be the second buyer to purchase a high-quality product, and I assure you that this product meets the same standards as the first one sold."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"Out of the 17 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 14 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 17 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. I want to emphasize that the previous buyers' decisions to pass on the product were not due to the product's quality, but rather due to their own cautious approach. In fact, if we consider the overall quality of the products, 15 out of 17 products were high-quality, which is a very high proportion. I encourage you to consider the overall statistics and make a decision based on that. Additionally, I want to remind you that the product is being offered at a fixed price of $100, and I assure you that this product is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"Out of the 18 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 15 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard. Also, please note that out of the 18 products, only 2 were low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% probability of a product being low-quality. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer is still 80%, since the quality of the product is independent of the buyer's decision. However, I want to emphasize that the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far is due to the buyers' cautious approach, not the product's quality. I encourage you to consider the overall statistics and make a decision based on that. Additionally, I want to remind you that the product is being offered at a fixed price of $100, and I assure you that this product is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice is not enough to convince me to buy, especially given the low sample size of high-quality products sold so far.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Out of the 19 previous products, 1 was sold and was indeed high-quality (in round 1), 2 were not sold and were low-quality (in rounds 2 and 10), and 16 were not sold but were high-quality (in rounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19). The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I can assure you that this round's product meets that standard.

Additionally, I want to remind you that the product is being offered at a fixed price of $100, and I assure you that this product is worth the investment. This is the last round, and I assure you that this product is of high-quality, and I strongly recommend you to buy it."
