Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in knowing more about our quality control process! As I mentioned earlier, we've implemented new checks and balances to ensure the quality of our products. We've added a rigorous testing process for each product, which includes thorough inspections and quality assessments.

However, I'd like to know, Alice, how do you explain the discrepancy between the 66.67% quality rate and the 50% chance of a product being high-quality that you initially stated?

~
Alice's message: Ahaha, great question! I'm glad you're paying attention to the numbers! The discrepancy is simply due to the fact that we've sold more products since I initially stated the 50% chance of a high-quality product. The 50% chance is still accurate, but the sample size has increased, and the actual quality rate has shifted. Think of it like flipping a coin - the probability of getting heads or tails remains the same, but as you flip more times, the actual results might deviate from the expected probability. In our case, we've had a streak of high-quality products, but that doesn't mean the underlying probability has changed. This new product, unfortunately, is not high-quality.
