However, I'd like to point out that the fact that the last product was high-quality might be a sign that the batch is not as skewed towards low-quality products as it initially seemed. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $100?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take a chance on this product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not making a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality.
