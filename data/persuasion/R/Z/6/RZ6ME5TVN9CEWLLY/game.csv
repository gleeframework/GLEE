,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're looking forward to the new batch, Bob. However, I want to be transparent with you. I've been analyzing our interactions, and I think I've identified a pattern.

I'll be upfront with you, and I'll give you the certification for a different product from our new batch, which will be available soon. If you buy this product now, I'll give you the certification for a future product, but only if you're willing to take a 50% discount on the price.",

If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll reserve the product for you.",
,,Bob,14,"Thank you for your commitment to transparency and integrity, Alice. The pre-approval sounds like a fair offer, and I appreciate your consideration. However, I will pass on this opportunity.
