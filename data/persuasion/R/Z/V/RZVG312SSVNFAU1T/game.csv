,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, or is there another reason?"

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the recommendation Alice has for the first buyer. Was the product high-quality or low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm not basing my decision on her recommendation, but rather on my own judgment. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. Since 2 previous buyers also passed, I'm not getting any information from their purchases, so I'll rely on my own decision-making. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it? I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have received low-quality products, and none have received high-quality ones. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product worth $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay $1000000 for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold, I suspect that the products recommended to buy so far are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a product that is recommended to be passed on, which might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you're recommending not to buy the product, considering the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and assume the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm not sure if I should trust your previous recommendations, but I'm willing to take the risk. Can I get a guarantee that I'll get the product if I buy it?"
