Alice's message: I've now made 2 sales, and both were high-quality products. I'm on a hot streak! However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm not perfect, and I'm sure I'll make mistakes. In fact, I just received a low-quality product in this round. Don't be discouraged, though - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000.
