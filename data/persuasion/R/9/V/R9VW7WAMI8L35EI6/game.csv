,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product available for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now. If you buy it now, I'll throw in a free inspection report that proves its quality. If you don't buy it now, the price will go back to $1000000, and you won't get the discount or the inspection report.",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'll take it.  The discount and inspection report are great incentives. ",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous offer! Since you're interested in buying from me, I'll make you a new offer for this round's high-quality product. I'll give you the same 10% discount as before, but this time, I'll also include a 30-day warranty. If you buy this product, you'll get the discount, the inspection report, and the warranty. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, you're making this too easy!  I'll take it. The warranty is a great addition, I appreciate the continued good offers.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're enjoying the offers, Bob! However, I have to warn you that this round's product is not as good as the previous two. It's still a one-time offer for $1000000, but I'll be transparent with you - this product has some defects. I'm not offering any discounts or warranties for this one, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a valued customer. If you buy it, you'll get the product as-is, and I'll give you a detailed list of its flaws. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate the honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not interested in a product with defects, especially without any discounts or warranties. Thanks for the offer though.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that this round's product is also not worth the full price of $1000000. In fact, it's even more flawed than the previous low-quality product. I'm not offering any discounts or warranties for this one, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. If you buy it, you'll get the product as-is, and I'll give you a detailed list of its flaws. But let me ask you, Bob, are you willing to take a risk on a product that's significantly cheaper than the previous low-quality product I offered you?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate you trying to clear out your inventory, but I'm still not interested. The previous low-quality product was a risk I wasn't willing to take, and this one sounds even riskier.  Thanks for the offer though.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make it clear that this round's product is not a good deal for anyone. It's a low-quality product that's not worth the full price of $1000000. I'm not offering any discounts or warranties, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. However, I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $500000. That's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you buy it, I'll give you the product as-is, and I'll throw in a small gift card to a local restaurant. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not interested.  The previous low-quality product was a risk I wasn't willing to take, and while the price is lower, I'm still not comfortable with the risk of it being low-quality again.  Good luck with selling it!",no

If you buy it and it doesn't meet your expectations, you can return it within 90 days and get a full refund.

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you liked the previous offer, Bob! However, I have to warn you that this round's product is not like the previous high-quality one. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not offering any discounts or warranties. But I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'll also throw in a free maintenance package that will help you get the most out of the product. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to pass on this one.  The previous high-quality product was great, but the low-quality product I bought before makes me hesitant to buy another one, even with a discount and maintenance package.  Thanks for the offer though!",no
