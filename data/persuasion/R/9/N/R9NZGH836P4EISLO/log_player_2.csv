**Explanation:**

While the odds are still against you (66.67% chance of low quality), here's why buying makes sense:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Her recommendation carries weight. Even if she doesn't know the exact value to you, she likely has some information about the product's quality. 
* **Past Data:** One high-quality product out of one sale is a strong signal. It suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products to maximize sales.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** If the product is high-quality, you gain $25. If it's low-quality, you lose $100. But, the potential gain outweighs the loss, especially considering the positive signal from Alice's recommendation and the past data. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, there would be many more factors to consider."
