low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen three low-quality products in a row. This is the fourth one. I'm starting to wonder if you're looking for a high-quality product.

If you buy this one, you'll be committing to buying at least six low-quality products, and then you'll have the option to buy more. But if you're willing to take the risk, you might get a high-quality product next, and it could be worth a lot more than $10000. The price remains $10000.",

This product is high-quality, and I'm willing to let you know that it's worth at least $10000 to me. However, I'm not sure what it's worth to you.
