high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 50%. However, since 3 out of 3 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
