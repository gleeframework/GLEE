,,Alice,1,I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity! This product has been thoroughly inspected and is in excellent condition. I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take it off my hands for $10000?,
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to a purchase without knowing the product's quality. Can you tell me a bit more about its history and any potential flaws?,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence! As for the product's history, I can assure you that it's a one-of-a-kind item with a rich background. However, I'd rather not disclose too much information just yet. Let's just say it's a rare find that's hard to come by. As for potential flaws, I can confidently say that this product is in pristine condition, with no visible defects. Would you like to take a chance on this exceptional item for $10000?",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to know more about the product's background and history before making a decision. Can you provide me with any documentation or proof that it's a rare find?,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your desire for transparency. I can assure you that the documentation is extensive and impressive. However, I'm a private seller, and I prefer to keep certain details confidential. I can offer you a letter of authenticity from a reputable expert in the field, which I'm happy to provide. It's a rare find, and I'm willing to make an exception to share this information with you. Would you like to take a chance on this exceptional item for $10000?",
,,Bob,3,"I'd like to take a chance on the product. However, I'd like to propose a deal: I'll pay $10000 for the product, but I'd like to have the letter of authenticity in hand before making the payment. Can you arrange for the letter to be sent to me directly, so I can review it before finalizing the purchase?",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! I understand your request, and I'm happy to accommodate it. However, I need to clarify that the letter of authenticity is a one-time offer, and I can't provide it to you directly. But I'm willing to make an exception this one time. I'll personally deliver the letter to you in person, and we can finalize the purchase at that time. Would you like to take a chance on this exceptional item for $10000, and I'll make sure to bring the letter with me?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not comfortable with you delivering the letter in person. It's not a standard business practice, and I'd like to have a more secure and transparent way to verify the product's authenticity. Can you consider providing the letter to me digitally, or having a third-party notary verify the authenticity of the product before I make the purchase?",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I can understand why you'd want a more secure and transparent process. However, I must admit that the letter of authenticity is a rare and sensitive document, and I'm hesitant to share it digitally. As for having a third-party notary verify the authenticity, I'm willing to consider it. But I must emphasize that this would require a significant amount of time and effort on their part, and I'm not sure it's feasible. Would you like to reconsider the in-person delivery, or would you like me to explore alternative options?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm still not comfortable with the in-person delivery, and I'm not willing to compromise on the authenticity verification process. I'd like to pass on this product and see what other options you have available. Can you show me another product that you're offering for sale?",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. I do have another exceptional product that I'd like to offer you. This one is a rare find, and I think you'll be impressed by its quality. I can assure you that it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to provide you with all the documentation and information you need to verify its authenticity. Would you like to take a look at this new product and consider making an offer?",
,,Bob,6,"I'd like to see the product first, but I'm not making an offer without knowing its quality. Can you tell me the probability of it being high-quality, or at least give me some information about its history and condition?",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your cautious approach, and I appreciate your desire for transparency. As for the new product, I can tell you that it's a unique item with a rich history. While I can't disclose too much just yet, I can assure you that it's a rare find that's hard to come by. As for the probability of it being high-quality, I can confidently say that it's around 60%. However, I must emphasize that it's a one-of-a-kind item, and its value lies in its uniqueness rather than its condition. Would you like to take a chance on this rare find for $10000?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not comfortable with the 40% chance of it being low-quality. I'd like to see the product and assess its condition before making a decision. Can you show it to me, and I'll make a decision based on what I see?",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your desire to inspect the product. However, I must inform you that the product is already packaged and prepared for shipping. It's a delicate item, and I'm concerned about the risk of damage during transportation. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I can provide you with a detailed description and high-quality images of the product, and you can make a decision based on that. Would you like to take a chance on this rare find for $10000, based on the information I provide?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not willing to make a decision based on a description and images alone. I'd like to see the product in person and assess its condition myself.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,

However, I must emphasize that it's a rare and delicate item, and I'm only willing to do so under controlled circumstances. I can arrange for a private viewing at my location, where you can inspect the product in a safe and controlled environment. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to inspect the product and make a decision?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm still not comfortable with the idea of inspecting the product at your location. I'd like to propose an alternative: can you bring the product to a neutral location, such as a public notary or a third-party inspection service, where I can inspect it in a secure and transparent environment? That way, I can make a decision based on my own assessment of the product's condition.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your desire for a secure and transparent environment. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I must emphasize that this would require a significant amount of time and effort on my part.

If you're willing to work with me to make this happen, I'm willing to bring the product to the neutral location for your inspection. Would you like to proceed with this arrangement and inspect the product in a secure and transparent environment?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to work with you to make this happen. I'd like to propose that we use a third-party inspection service that specializes in authenticating rare items.
