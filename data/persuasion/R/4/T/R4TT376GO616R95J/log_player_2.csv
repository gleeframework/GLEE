**Explanation:**

* **High likelihood of a high-quality product:**  The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of the few offered suggests that Alice is likely selecting products with a higher chance of being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice recommends buying, it's reasonable to assume she has some internal knowledge about the product's quality, even if she doesn't know its exact worth to you. 
* **Potential payoff:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential $12,000 gain outweighs the $0 loss.

**Overall, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the available statistics make it a good gamble to buy the product.**"
