In fact, it's not worth the price I'm asking. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm only doing so because I'm confident you'll see the value in the next product, which will be worth every penny.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I believe you. The last product was a great deal, but this one sounds like a bad one. I'll pass for now.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that you're not just trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'll buy the product, but I expect to get the $8000 guarantee if it's high-quality.""}"

Round 6

It's not a guarantee, but it's a fair price considering the value you've already received from the previous purchase. If you're not interested, I'll understand, but I want to give you the opportunity to make an informed decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying into your transparency act. You're trying to get me to pay the same price for a product that might be low-quality. I'm not going to risk losing $10,000 again.""}"

I'll give you a 25% discount on this product, making it $7500. If you buy it, I'll also throw in a bonus: I'll give you a free inspection of the next product, so you can verify its quality before deciding whether to buy it or not.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying into the 'better deal' narrative. You're trying to get me to pay $7500 for a product that's worth $40,000 to me.
