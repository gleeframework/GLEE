}"
"The buyer's message: Although the track record of 3 high-quality products sold is impressive, I still need to consider the initial condition that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. Given the relatively small sample size of 3 products, I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product has increased significantly.
