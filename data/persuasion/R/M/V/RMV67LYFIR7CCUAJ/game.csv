low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to do so."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any pattern in Alice's recommendations, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to trust the statistics and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can I see the previous sales record again?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation, I think there's a good chance this product is high-quality and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the products recommended to them were low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product you're recommending me to buy is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality based on the statistics. Since 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of them bought it, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'll pass on the product for now."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 6 failed sales and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to assume it's low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendation, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely 0. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to pass on this product."
