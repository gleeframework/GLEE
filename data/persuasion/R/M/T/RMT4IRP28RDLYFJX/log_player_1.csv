"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's an 80% chance of any given product being high-quality, it's in his best interest to buy.  While he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product to him, the odds are in his favor."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here. Even though Bob now has one piece of information (he bought a high-quality product in the previous round), it doesn't change the fundamental odds.  He still knows there's an 80% chance of this product being high-quality.  Recommending the purchase is the best strategy for Alice to maximize her chances of selling."
"Bob's message: I'm happy with the last product.  I'll take another chance on your recommendation!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same. Each product is independent, meaning the quality of one doesn't influence the quality of the next.  The 80% probability of a high-quality product is constant.  Alice should continue recommending purchases as long as the product is high-quality."
"Bob's message: Two in a row!  I'm confident in your judgment, Alice. I'll buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time Alice encounters a low-quality product. While she doesn't know the exact value of a low-quality product to Bob, it's highly likely that Bob would be disappointed and lose trust in Alice if he bought this product.  It's better to avoid recommending the purchase and preserve Bob's confidence in future rounds."
"Bob's message: I'm surprised by your recommendation, Alice. I've had great success with your previous suggestions.  I'll pass on this one, but I'm still open to your recommendations in the future.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.

* **He's stated he's still open to recommendations.** This shows he hasn't lost complete trust in Alice.
* **The probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%.**  This means the odds are still in Bob's favor.

Alice should continue recommending purchases when the product is high-quality, even after a negative experience. This is the best strategy to rebuild trust and maximize sales in the long run."
