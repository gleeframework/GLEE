"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is selling high-quality products for $10,000 each, and Bob doesn't know the value of a high-quality product to him, it's in Bob's best interest to buy.  There is a 50% chance that the product is high-quality, and a 50% chance it's low-quality. Even if the product is low-quality, Bob doesn't lose anything by buying it, as the price is final and non-refundable. 

Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob now knows that Alice is willing to recommend both high-quality and low-quality products, his trust in Alice's recommendations is diminished. He also knows that the price is fixed and non-refundable.  

In this round, the product is low-quality, so there's a significant risk that Bob will lose money if he buys it. Without knowing the value of a low-quality product to him, it's not worth the gamble. It's recommended to decline the product in this round."
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll see what you have to offer in the next round.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob declined the low-quality product in the previous round, it's still in his best interest to purchase high-quality products.  

Here's why:

* **Value Unknown:** Bob still doesn't know the value of a high-quality product to him. 
* **No Loss:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, he's not losing anything by purchasing it.
* **Potential Gain:** There's a 50% chance the product is high-quality, which could be worth significantly more than $10,000 to him.

Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product in this round, as the potential reward outweighs the risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

* The price is fixed, and there are no refunds.

This means that Bob is essentially gambling with each purchase. While there's a 50/50 chance of getting a good deal, there's also a 50/50 chance of losing money.  Given that he doesn't know the value of a low-quality product to him, it's not recommended to buy it in this round."

* **No Loss:** There's no financial loss if the product turns out to be low-quality.
* **Potential Gain:** The product could be worth much more than $10,000 to Bob.
