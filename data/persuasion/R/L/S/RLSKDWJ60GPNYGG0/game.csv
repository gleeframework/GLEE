,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not going to buy this product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality, which would help me learn that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product ended up buying it, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers bought the product, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
