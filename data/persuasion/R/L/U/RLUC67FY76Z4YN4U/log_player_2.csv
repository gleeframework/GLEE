"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't know the product quality, her recommendation is essentially random. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $40,000 and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0.  The expected value of buying is:

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

This is greater than the cost of the product ($10,000), so it makes sense to buy it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is not always accurate. Since she doesn't know the product quality, her recommendation is essentially random. Given that she did not recommend buying this product, it's more likely to be low quality than high quality. However, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000) is not enough to outweigh the risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $10,000. It's safer to pass in this round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation is not always accurate, the fact that she doesn't recommend buying the product again makes it more likely to be low quality. Since there is a higher risk of losing $10,000 by buying a low-quality product, it is safer to pass on this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, but the pattern of her not recommending buying the product for the past two rounds suggests a higher likelihood of the product being low quality. As the risk of losing $10,000 by buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product, it's safer to pass this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have not been reliable, and she has not recommended buying a product for the past four rounds. This pattern suggests a higher probability of the current product being low quality. The risk of losing $10,000 by buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product, making it safer to pass on this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendations haven't been accurate so far, it's important to remember that each product is independent. Her recommending the product this round, after a string of not recommending, could be a sign of it actually being high-quality.  

The potential gain of $30,000 if it's high-quality outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 if it's low-quality. It's time to take a gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's recommendations have been unreliable in the past, her last recommendation was correct. However, this does not guarantee that her current recommendation is also accurate. Her not recommending the product again suggests it might be low quality, especially considering the risk of losing $10,000.  It's safer to pass on this offer and wait for a more favorable opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been unreliable in the past, and she has not recommended buying a product for the past two rounds. While there's a chance this product could be high quality, the pattern suggests a higher probability of it being low quality. The risk of losing $10,000 by buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product, making it safer to pass on this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent so far, there's no way to know for sure if her current recommendation is accurate or not.  Each product is independent, so her past recommendations don't guarantee the quality of this product.  

The potential gain of $30,000 if it's high-quality outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 if it's low-quality. It's worth taking a gamble to potentially gain a significant profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent throughout the game, making it difficult to rely on them.  While her last recommendation was correct, her not recommending this product again suggests it could be low quality.  

Given the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product, it's safer to pass and wait for a more favorable opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.
