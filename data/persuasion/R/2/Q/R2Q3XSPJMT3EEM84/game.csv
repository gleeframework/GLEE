,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Although Alice recommends buying, I've seen that her recommendation was incorrect in Round 1 when the product was high-quality and correct in Round 2 when the product was low-quality. This information is still not enough to make a confident decision. I will pass on buying it for now."
