,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'd like to wait for some data to form a more informed decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to consider the fact that you're recommending it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the recommendation is based on. Is it a random guess or is there some statistical analysis behind it?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me how many buyers have been presented with a product and how many products have been sold in total?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation and the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record, but I'd like to take the chance to learn more about the product's quality and update my own probability assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can explain your recommendation. I'm a bit skeptical about your previous recommendations, and I'd like to know if there's any particular reason why you think this product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide me with more information about the previous sales record, such as the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what made you think it's not worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my beliefs about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%, and the value I place on it, which is $4000000. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product out of 7 sold, the probability of the current product being high quality is 1/7 or approximately 0.1429. This is less than the probability of it being low quality, which is 6/7 or approximately 0.8571. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 7 sales, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/7. However, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold if I were to buy it. If I pass, the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next draw would be 1/6. If I buy, the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next draw would be 2/7. I'd like to pass on this product to increase the chances of a high-quality product being sold in the next draw."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision, including the proportion of high-quality products sold."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will have a better offer."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as you've seen the previous sales record. Can you share some insights about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 7, I can infer that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than I expected. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
