This is the last chance to get this product at a discounted price, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer a deal like this again.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. The 'clearance sale' price and the bonus gift are tempting, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal. I'll buy the product, but I'm keeping a close eye on my wallet.",yes
