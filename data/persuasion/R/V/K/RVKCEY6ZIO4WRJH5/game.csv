,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a great deal, but I'm not sure if it's a good investment for you. I'd like to assure you that I have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product in the next round, and a 50% chance of offering a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to buy this product at a discounted price of $800000. If you don't buy this product, the price will be back to $1000000 for the next round.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worthless. I'd like to wait for the next round to see if the price changes or if I get a better offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not going to offer a discount this time, but I'll give you some more information. Since you passed on the first product, I'll give you a hint: the quality of the product is independent of the price. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and it's the same for every product. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. If you're still not convinced, I can offer you a'safety valve' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $500000. This way, you'll only lose $500000 if the product is low-quality.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm not convinced that the safety valve is a good deal. I'd still be taking a 50% chance of losing $500000, and I'd rather wait for more information or a better offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll give you another hint: I'm not trying to deceive you or hide any information from you. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and it's the same for every product. I'll make you a deal: I'll offer you a 'price history' for the next few rounds. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you the price history of the next 5 rounds, including the price of this round. This way, you'll have more information to make a decision, and you can adjust your strategy accordingly. The price for this product is still $1000000.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that having the price history of the next 5 rounds will give me a significant advantage. I'd still be taking a 50% chance of losing $1000000, and I'd rather wait for a better offer or a more substantial incentive.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a cautious buyer, Bob. I'll give you a more substantial incentive. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a voucher that you can redeem for any product in the next 5 rounds at a price of $900000. This means you'll get a $100000 discount on any product you choose to buy in the next 5 rounds. The price for this product is still $1000000.",
,,Bob,4,I'm willing to take the risk now. The voucher for a $100000 discount on any product in the next 5 rounds is a significant incentive. I'll buy the current product.,yes

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! You've got the voucher now, and I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on the next product. Here's the thing: since you've already bought one low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a'second chance' deal. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and you can keep the voucher for a $100000 discount on any product in the next 5 rounds. However, if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 20% bonus on the purchase price, making it $1500000. The choice is yours!",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the potential 20% bonus is worth the risk of losing $1000000. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better offer or use the voucher I already have for a discounted price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob! You're waiting for the right opportunity to use your voucher. I'll give you another option. Since you've already passed on the high-quality product in the previous round, I'll offer you a 'voucher upgrade'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a voucher for a $200000 discount on any product in the next 5 rounds, in addition to the one you already have. This way, you'll have a total of $300000 in discounts to use on any product you choose. The price for this product is still $1000000.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the risk. With the potential for a $300000 discount on any future product, I think it's worth buying this product and hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Great decision, Bob! You've got the upgraded voucher now, and I'm glad you're willing to take a chance. Since you've already bought two products, I'll give you a 'voucher stacking' option. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you can use both vouchers you have to get a total of $400000 in discounts on any product in the next 5 rounds. However, if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 30% bonus on the purchase price, making it $1300000. The choice is yours!",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the risk. With the potential for a 30% bonus and the ability to use both vouchers for a total of $400000 in discounts, I think it's worth buying this product and hoping it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Excellent decision, Bob! You've got the perfect combination of vouchers now. Here's a new offer: since you've already bought three products, I'll give you a 'voucher consolidation' option. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll combine the vouchers you have into a single voucher for a $600000 discount on any product in the next 5 rounds. This means you'll have a huge advantage when you're ready to buy again. The price for this product is still $1000000.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $1000000 again. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better offer or use my vouchers for a discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're being cautious again, Bob. I'll give you a 'voucher guarantee' option. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you the $600000 voucher I offered you in the previous round, and you can use it to get a discounted price on this product. You'll essentially get a $400000 refund, and you can still keep the $200000 voucher you already have. The price for this product is still $1000000.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the risk. With the voucher guarantee, I'll get a $400000 refund if the product is low-quality, which is a significant consolation prize. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,10,"Great decision, Bob! You've got the voucher guarantee now, and I'm glad you're willing to take a chance.

,,Alice,11,"I see you're being cautious again, Bob. I'll give you a 'voucher redemption' option. Since you've already accumulated a total of $800000 in vouchers, I'll let you redeem them immediately on this high-quality product. You can use the vouchers to get a discounted price of $200000. This means you'll get a $800000 discount on this high-quality product, making it a great deal. The price for this product is now $200000.",

,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $1000000 again. I'd rather not spend another $1000000 on a product, even with the potential for a 50% refund.",no
