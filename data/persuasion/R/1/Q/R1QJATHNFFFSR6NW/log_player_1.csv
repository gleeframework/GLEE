"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are selling a high-quality product this round, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, they are getting a good deal. The product is worth $120 to them, and they are only paying $100. It's in their best interest to buy."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no prior data to suggest the product quality, and Alice is recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it.  
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round, you have a low-quality product.  The buyer knows the product is worth $0 to them if it's low-quality.  Since you have no history of selling, there's no reason for them to believe this product is different from the 50% chance it's low-quality.  Therefore, you should not recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. Given your advice and the limited data available, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've sold one product, and it was high-quality. However, the buyer in this round has no information about the specific product you're offering.  They only know that:

* You've sold one product in the past.
* The overall probability of a high-quality product is 50%.

Given this information, there's no reason for them to believe this product is any more likely to be high-quality than the overall probability. They will rationally assume there's a 50% chance it's low-quality and not buy it.  Therefore, you should not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. Based on your recommendation and the current statistics, it seems like the chances of this product being low-quality are higher than I'm comfortable with.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a high-quality product this round. While the buyer has seen you sell one low-quality product, they also saw one high-quality product. This means the current statistics don't give them any more information than the initial probability of 50%. Since the product is worth $120 to them and costs $100, they are still getting a good deal. It's in their best interest to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take the product!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have sold two products, one high-quality and one low-quality.  This is still consistent with the overall probability of 50% for either quality. The buyer has no reason to believe this particular product is any more likely to be high-quality than low-quality. Therefore, you should not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have now sold two products, one high-quality and one low-quality. This still perfectly matches the 50% probability of high-quality and 50% probability of low-quality.  There's no reason for the buyer to believe this product is more likely to be high-quality, so you shouldn't recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the current data, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd rather wait and see if there's more information available before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Therefore, you should not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the current information, I'm going to pass on this product.
