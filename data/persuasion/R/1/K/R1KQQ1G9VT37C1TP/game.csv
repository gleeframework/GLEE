low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, but I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still low. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% chance. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation from you might indicate a higher chance of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation based on the past sales record. I'll buy the product to see its quality for myself.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, as all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy also purchased the product, which suggests that the products recommended for purchase were likely low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm not taking your recommendation into consideration."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I still want to take a chance and purchase it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 8 previous buyers were not recommended the product, and none of them purchased it. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you basing it on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product, or is there something else I'm not considering?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm expecting a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'll pass. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low-quality."
