,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm the first one and I don't have any information to go on. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality or just a random guess."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision on my own. Can I see the product before I decide? Or can you give me some additional information about the product's quality? I'm not sure I trust your recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that 1 out of 1 product sold was high quality, but I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sale before making a decision. Can you tell me about the quality of the product that the first buyer purchased?

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I would like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased the product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is around 33.33%. Given the low probability, I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since I have access to the statistics. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
