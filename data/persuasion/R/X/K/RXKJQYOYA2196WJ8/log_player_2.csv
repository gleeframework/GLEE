Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the probability of the current product being high-quality. Based on our current success rate of 62.5% and the number of products sold, I can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality. Let's assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is x. Then, the probability of a product being low-quality is 1-x. Since we've sold 5 high-quality products out of 8 total products, we can set up the equation 5/(8) = x / (x + 1-x). Solving for x, we get x = 5/7. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 5/7, or approximately 71.4%. With this new product being high-quality, I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?
