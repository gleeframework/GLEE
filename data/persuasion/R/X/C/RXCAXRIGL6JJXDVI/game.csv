high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 buyers purchased, which is lower than the expected 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
