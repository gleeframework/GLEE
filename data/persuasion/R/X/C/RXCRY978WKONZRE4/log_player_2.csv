**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Track Record:**  Alice's recommendations have resulted in 5 high-quality products being sold out of 5 purchases. This suggests a very high accuracy rate in her recommendations. 
* **Potential Profit:**  Even with the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product.
* **Alice's Knowledge:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product and has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality items to maintain her reputation and sales.

**While there's still a risk, the high success rate of Alice's previous recommendations makes buying the product a worthwhile gamble.**"
