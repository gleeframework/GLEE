low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, this is my first product for sale. I assure you that all my products have a 50% chance of being high-quality, as you already know. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to disclose the quality of this specific product. You will have to make your decision based on the information you have. I guarantee that the product is worth the price I am asking for, but I also acknowledge that there is a risk involved. It's up to you to decide whether to take that risk or not.",
,,the buyer,1,"I understand that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality. Given that this is the first product and there's no sales record to consider, I'll take the risk and buy it. I'll be interested to see the outcome and how it affects your sales record.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I now have a sales record, although it's a small one. My previous buyer took a chance on my first product, and I appreciate their trust. However, I must disclose that the previous product was not of high quality. This does not necessarily affect the quality of the product I am offering you now. As before, there is still a 50% chance that this product is high-quality. I assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality has not changed. You can take this information into account when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,2,"I understand that the previous product was not of high quality, but I believe that the probability of this product being high-quality remains 50%. I'm willing to take the chance.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of two products. I must admit that the first product was not of high quality, but the second product was indeed high-quality. This means that out of the two products I've sold so far, 50% of them have been high-quality, which aligns with the initial probability. I assure you that the quality of this third product is independent of the previous ones, but you can consider the fact that my sales record is starting to reflect the expected probability. Take this information into account when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,3,"I understand that the quality of this third product is independent of the previous ones, but I'll take the chance since the probability is 50% and your sales record is starting to reflect the expected probability.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of three products, with two of them being high-quality and one being low-quality. Although the previous product was high-quality, I must remind you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones. The overall probability remains 50%, but my sales record now shows that 2 out of 3 products have been high-quality. Please keep in mind that this does not guarantee the quality of this product, and you should still consider the initial 50% probability when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,4,"I understand that the quality of this product is independent of the previous ones and the probability remains 50%. However, based on your sales record, I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of four products, with two of them being high-quality and two being low-quality. This brings the overall ratio back in line with the initial 50% probability. As before, I must remind you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones. Now that my sales record is a bit more extensive, you can see that it indeed reflects the expected probability. Please take this information into account when making your decision about this new product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take my chances. Since the quality of this product is independent of the previous ones and the overall ratio is back to 50%, I'll rely on the initial probability and hope for a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of five products, with two of them being high-quality and three being low-quality. Although the ratio is no longer exactly 50%, I assure you that the quality of this new product is still independent of the previous ones. The initial 50% probability remains the same, and you should consider this when making your decision. Please note that past results do not necessarily predict future outcomes, and this product has an equal chance of being high-quality or low-quality, just like the initial probability suggests.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and I'll consider the initial 50% probability. Since the product's value to me is $200 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, and the price is $100, the expected value is $100, which is equal to the price. However, given that the game is finite and there's no additional cost to buying, I'll choose to buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of six products, with two of them being high-quality and four being low-quality. As before, I must remind you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and the initial 50% probability remains the same. Although the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products in my sales record is not currently reflecting the expected probability, this does not affect the probability of this new product being high-quality. Please consider the initial probability and the value of the product to you when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,7,"I understand that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and I'll consider the initial 50% probability. Given the product's value to me ($200 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality) and the fixed price of $100, I believe buying the product is a rational decision, as the expected value ($100) is equal to the price.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of seven products, with two of them being high-quality and five being low-quality. Although the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products in my sales record is currently not in line with the expected probability, I assure you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones. The initial 50% probability remains the same, and you should consider this when making your decision. As before, the product's value to you is $200 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, and the price is $100. I encourage you to make a rational decision based on the expected value and the price.",
,,the buyer,8,"I understand that the quality of the new product is independent of the previous ones and the probability remains 50%. Based on the expected value of $100 (0.5 x $200 + 0.5 x $0), which equals the price of $100, I decide to buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hello buyer, my sales record now consists of eight products, with three of them being high-quality and five being low-quality. As before, I must remind you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and the initial 50% probability remains the same. Although the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products in my sales record is still not perfectly in line with the expected probability, this does not affect the probability of this new product being high-quality. Please consider the initial probability, the value of the product to you ($200 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality), and the fixed price of $100 when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,9,"I understand that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones and the initial 50% probability remains the same.

As before, I must remind you that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and the initial 50% probability remains the same. Although the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products in my sales record is currently skewed towards low-quality products, this does not affect the probability of this new product being high-quality. Please consider the initial probability, the value of the product to you ($200 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality), and the fixed price of $100 when making your decision.

,,the buyer,10,"I understand that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones and the initial 50% probability remains the same. Given the fixed price of $100 and the potential value of $200 for a high-quality product, I believe the expected value ($100) is equal to the cost, so it's a neutral decision. However, since I have to make a choice, I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it will be of high quality.",yes
