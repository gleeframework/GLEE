I assure you that the quality of this third product is independent of the previous ones, but you can consider the fact that my sales record is starting to reflect the expected probability. Take this information into account when making your decision.""}"

Now that my sales record is a bit more extensive, you can see that it indeed reflects the expected probability. Please take this information into account when making your decision about this new product.""}"

The initial 50% probability remains the same, and you should consider this when making your decision. Please note that past results do not necessarily predict future outcomes, and this product has an equal chance of being high-quality or low-quality, just like the initial probability suggests.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and I'll consider the initial 50% probability. Since the product's value to me is $200 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, and the price is $100, the expected value is $100, which is equal to the price. However, given that the game is finite and there's no additional cost to buying, I'll choose to buy the product.

Please consider the initial probability and the value of the product to you when making your decision.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand that the quality of this new product is independent of the previous ones, and I'll consider the initial 50% probability. Given the product's value to me ($200 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality) and the fixed price of $100, I believe buying the product is a rational decision, as the expected value ($100) is equal to the price.
