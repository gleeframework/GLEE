Alice's message: I was thinking that if I were to be selling a high-quality product, it's likely that I would have sold at least one by now, given the number of potential buyers I've had. However, I've only sold 2 low-quality products, which suggests that I might be biased towards selling low-quality products. This could be due to various reasons, such as a bad batch or a mistake in my selection process. I want to be transparent with you, and I'm willing to take a chance on selling a high-quality product.
