``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $300) outweighs the risk. 

* **Previous sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was already sold is a good sign.  It suggests a higher probability of the current product also being high-quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This provides additional confidence that it is likely high-quality.

**It's important to note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that benefits her long-term reputation.  If she were to consistently recommend low-quality products, she would quickly lose customers."
