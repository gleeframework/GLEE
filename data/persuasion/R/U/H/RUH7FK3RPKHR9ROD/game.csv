,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and the probability of it being high quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product that others have somehow missed."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the products recommended to the previous buyers were low-quality. Therefore, I will not buy the current product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the low sales record so far. Given the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm hoping to get a good one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and rejected the product, which suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. Given that the probability of a product being high quality is 50%, I will pass on the product to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far are low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be selected."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With no high-quality products sold yet, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product, given the lack of sales so far and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation.

,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
