**Explanation:**

Since there's no prior data on the quality of products, we have to rely on the base probability.  A high-quality product is worth $40,000 and has an 80% chance, while a low-quality product is worth $0 and has a 20% chance. 

**Expected Value:**

The expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $40,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value is positive and significantly higher than the purchase price of $10,000, it's a good idea to buy the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The current statistics show that 100% of the products sold have been high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are very accurate, and the product she's recommending is likely high-quality.
* **Potential for High Reward:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $40,000 high-quality product is significant and outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on the information provided and assumes Alice's recommendations are reliable. However, it's always wise to consider the potential risks and make a decision that aligns with your individual risk tolerance."
