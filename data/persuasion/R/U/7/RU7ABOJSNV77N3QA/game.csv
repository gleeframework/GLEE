,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low number of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll take a chance and pass."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. However, if I buy this product and it's low quality, I'll lose $10000. If I pass and the product is low quality, it will be discarded and I won't lose anything. I'll wait for the next product."
