**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds information. She's likely to recommend a product she believes is high quality. This doesn't guarantee it, but it increases the likelihood.
* **Previous Sale:** One high-quality product being sold out of one purchase further supports the possibility of a higher-than-average quality product being offered.

**Overall:** The combination of Alice's recommendation and the previous sale makes it worth the risk to purchase. Even if the product turns out to be low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the loss."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  All the products she recommended were high-quality. This is a strong signal that her recommendations are likely to be reliable.
* **Potential Value:** Even with the 50/50 chance of quality, a high-quality product is worth $300, while a low-quality product is worth $0. The potential upside outweighs the risk.

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the strong positive signal from Alice's previous recommendations makes buying a worthwhile gamble."
