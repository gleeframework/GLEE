Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, and the price is fixed at $100, it's always a good idea to recommend buying a high-quality product.  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, so they will weigh this information against the $100 price."

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and the price is fixed at $100.  They also have the information from the previous round where they bought a high-quality product. This will likely make them more likely to buy again, but it's impossible to know for sure. Since we are trying to maximize our sales, it's always a good idea to recommend buying a high-quality product."

While we don't know the buyer's valuation for low-quality products, we are trying to maximize our sales. Recommending a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100 is likely to lead to the buyer not buying the product. This would harm our sales record and could potentially deter future buyers.  Therefore, it's best to not recommend buying a low-quality product in this round."

* **Maximizing Sales:**  Recommending a high-quality product gives us the best chance of a sale. We know the buyer values high-quality products, and this is a good opportunity to build trust. 
* **Building a Reputation:** While we don't know the buyer's valuation, consistently recommending high-quality products will help us build a reputation for honesty and quality. This could lead to more sales in the future.
