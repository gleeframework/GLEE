{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm happy to purchase the product!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Although there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, Alice's recommendation provides valuable information. Since Alice knows the true quality and has an incentive to make you buy a high-quality product, her recommendation significantly increases the perceived value of the product.  Therefore, it's a reasonable gamble to buy it."

```

**Explanation:**

In this round, Alice's lack of recommendation strongly suggests the product is low quality. Since she has an incentive to push high-quality products, her silence speaks volumes. It's more likely to be a low-quality product worth $0 to me, so I'll pass."
