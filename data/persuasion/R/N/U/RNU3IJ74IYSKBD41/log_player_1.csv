"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, the best strategy is to avoid buying the product. Here's why:

* **Unknown Value:** You don't know the value of the product to the buyer, and the buyer doesn't know the quality.
* **High Risk:** There's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, meaning the buyer could lose $1,000,000.
* **No Guarantee:** The price is fixed, and there's no refund policy. 

It's simply too risky to buy a product with an unknown value and a 50% chance of being low-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I will pass on this product.  With no prior sales data, I am not comfortable taking the risk of buying a product that has a 50/50 chance of being worthless.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation hasn't changed significantly from Round 1. 

* **No Sales History:** There's still no sales history to influence the buyer's decision. 
* **Unknown Value:**  The buyer still doesn't know the value of a high-quality product to them.
* **High Risk:** The risk of buying a potentially low-quality product remains at 50%.

While this product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing that. It's still too risky to recommend purchasing."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no historical data and the product is not recommended, I will pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in the previous rounds. 

* **No Sales History:** There's still no evidence of past sales, and the buyer is risk-averse due to the unknown value of the product.
* **High Risk:**  The risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for a large sum is too significant.

Until there's some indication that the seller might be offering consistently high-quality products, recommending the buyer to purchase remains unwise."

The buyer didn't bought the product.
