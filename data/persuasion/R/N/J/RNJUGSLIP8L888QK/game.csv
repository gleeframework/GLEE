,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability that it's high-quality based on the prior probabilities and the lack of sales data so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and given that you didn't recommend it, I'm inclined to pass on it. I'd like to know the overall proportion of low-quality products in the sold products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that she might be recommending a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a worthless product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far, and all 3 previous buyers who bought the products got low-quality ones. I'd like to see the next product."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get lucky."
