high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this is indeed a high-quality product. I'm willing to give you a certificate of authenticity, which you can verify with a third-party expert if you wish. This certificate will guarantee that the product is genuine and worth $40000 to you. I'll throw in a 10% discount on the price, making it $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can offer this price.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Let me sweeten the deal even further. I'll not only give you the certificate of authenticity, but I'll also throw in a 5-year warranty, which will guarantee that the product will retain its value. This way, you can be sure that you're getting a product that will last and appreciate in value over time. The price remains the same, $9000, but I'm confident that this additional warranty will give you the peace of mind you need to make a decision.",

,,Alice,4,"I've decided to take a different approach. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at a price that's not just a discount, but a flat-out guarantee. I'll sell it to you for $10000, and if you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked. But if you do decide to keep it, I'll also give you a $1000 bonus, on top of the product's true value of $40000. This way, you'll be getting a guaranteed profit of $31000. Is this a deal you can't refuse?",

If the product is indeed high-quality, you'll see the note confirming its value of $40000. If it's low-quality, the note will say so. The price remains the same, $10000.

I'll send you a separate, independent expert to inspect the product and give you a report on its quality. If the report confirms it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $1500 off the price. The price remains $10000, but you'll have an expert's confirmation to back it up.",

I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at a price that's not just a discount, but a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. I'll sell it to you for $9500, and if you don't buy it, I'll immediately destroy the product and it will be gone forever. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not bluffing. You'll never see a product like this again.",
