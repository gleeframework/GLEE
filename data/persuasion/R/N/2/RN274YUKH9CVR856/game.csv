,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20.00%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, which is a very low proportion.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than the overall probability, which might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
