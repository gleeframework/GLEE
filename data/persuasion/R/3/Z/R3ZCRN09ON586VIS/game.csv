I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a fair price considering its value. It's not a bad deal, and you might even find a use for it. But if you're not interested, I can offer you some advice on what to do with it.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're enjoying the high-quality products! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product.

It's a tiny fraction of the original price, and it's essentially a 'free' product. I'm not making much money on this one, but I think it's worth considering if you're interested in getting a product at an extremely low price.",
