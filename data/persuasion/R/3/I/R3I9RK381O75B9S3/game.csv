,,Alice,3,"Welcome! I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 2 products sold. You're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and you've seen that 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. I want to be transparent with you: the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, and it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. However, I'm still willing to sell this one for $1000000. Will you take the chance and buy it for $1000000?",
