high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I believe the true proportion of high-quality products is lower than 80.00%. Therefore, I'd like to pass on the current product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, which is a higher proportion than the 80% probability of a high-quality product.
