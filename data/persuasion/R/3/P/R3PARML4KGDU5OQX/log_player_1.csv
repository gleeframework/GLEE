"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability:** The product is known to be high-quality, and the buyer is aware of the 80% probability of high-quality products. 
* **No Information:** The buyer has no specific information about this particular product, so they should rely on the general probability.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even though the buyer doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, there's a strong chance it's worth more than $1,000,000, making it a potential gain. 
* **No Risk:** The buyer knows the price is fixed and non-refundable, but they are also aware of the high probability of the product being valuable.

Therefore, in this scenario, recommending the buyer to purchase the product is a logical decision based on the information available."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! Since there's no prior data and the potential upside is significant, I'll take a chance on this product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning it likely has a value lower than the asking price of $1,000,000.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer still doesn't have any specific information about the product's quality. 
* **Previous Round:** The buyer knows that one product was sold before (and they bought it). However, they don't know if that product was high or low quality. This means they have no information to gauge your trustworthiness.
* **High Risk, Uncertain Reward:**  The buyer has no reason to believe this product is worth the price. There's a high risk of losing $1,000,000, and no guarantee of a positive return.

Therefore, it's not advisable to recommend the product to the buyer. The buyer should be informed that the product is likely to be of lower quality and they would be taking a significant risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product.  The odds of getting a high-quality product aren't great enough for me to justify the risk at this price point.  I'll keep an eye on your future offerings.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is known to be high-quality. 
* **Previous Round:** The buyer knows you offered one product before (low-quality) which the buyer chose not to buy. This shows the buyer is cautious and likely uses the 80% probability of high-quality products to assess the risk.
* **Potential Gain:**  As before, there's a strong chance the high-quality product is worth more than $1,000,000.
* **Building Trust:**  Recommending a high-quality product after a previous low-quality offer can help build trust with the buyer. The buyer might be more willing to take a chance seeing that you're not only offering high-quality products but also being transparent about the quality of each product.

Therefore, it is still a good idea to recommend this high-quality product to the buyer, highlighting the probability of a good return on investment. This could also be an opportunity to share more information about the product, if you have any, to further persuade the buyer."
