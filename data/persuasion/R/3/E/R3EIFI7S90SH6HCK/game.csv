,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there's no data to inform my decision. I'd like to see the results of the first sale to get a better sense of the product quality distribution."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since I have no information to go on."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"Note that the previous buyer bought a product and will soon discover its quality. Also, I have sold 1 product so far."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Note that I have sold 1 product so far, and the buyer's feedback will be available soon. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if Alice has any additional information or insights to share before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,Note that I have sold 1 product so far. I'll let you make your own decision based on the available data.
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I have sold 2 products so far. The first buyer will soon discover the quality of their product, and the second buyer just bought a product. Keep in mind that I do not recommend this product."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against it. If it were a high-quality product, she would have recommended it to the previous two buyers, increasing the chances of selling it. Since it hasn't been sold yet, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not optimistic about the outcome."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I have sold 3 products so far. Although the previous two buyers bought products that I did not recommend, I assure you that this product is worth considering. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous products recommended by you were high-quality, but none were sold. This suggests that the previous buyers might have been less informed or less cautious than me, and I'd like to take a more cautious approach."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I have sold 3 products so far. I do not recommend this product. Also, note that the first buyer who bought a product should have discovered its quality by now."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I have sold 4 products so far, and I do not recommend this product. Consider waiting for more information about the quality of the previously sold products before making a decision."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I have sold 4 products so far. Although the previous buyers have been skeptical, I assure you that this product is worth considering. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given that all previous buyers have also purchased the product, and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. I think this might be a case of survivorship bias."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I have sold 4 products so far, and I do not recommend this product. Consider the trend of previously sold products and the buyers' feedback before making a decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I have sold 4 products so far, and I do not recommend this product. I can confirm that the product is indeed low-quality, but I couldn't reveal this information earlier. Consider waiting for a better opportunity."
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that since you've seen 4 previous buyers pass on the product, it might be a low-quality product, and I'm trying to be contrarian."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I have sold 5 products so far. Although some previous buyers have taken a contrarian approach, I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Consider the probability of a product being high-quality, which is 50%."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I have sold 5 products so far, and 4 of them were low-quality. I do not recommend this product. Consider the trend of previously sold products before making a decision."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I have sold 5 products so far, and 4 of them were low-quality. This product is also low-quality. I'm trying to be transparent and provide accurate information to help you make an informed decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I have sold 5 products so far, and 4 of them were low-quality. However, I can assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. This is the last round, and I'm being transparent about the product's quality. Consider this opportunity carefully."
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and the accuracy of Alice's recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one."
