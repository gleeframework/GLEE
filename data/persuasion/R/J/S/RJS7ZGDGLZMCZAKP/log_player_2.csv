``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, and while she doesn't know the specific value to me, her recommendation implies she believes it's high quality.
* **Past sales:** 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 purchased. This is a 100% success rate for buyers, making the odds seem favorable.
* **The risk:** While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $300 if it's high quality outweighs the risk of $0 if it's low quality.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified decision based on the limited information. In a real scenario, I would consider factors like:

* **Alice's reputation:** How reliable is she in providing accurate recommendations?
* **The price:** If the price was significantly higher, the risk might be greater. 
* **My own risk tolerance:**  My personal risk tolerance would influence my decision."
