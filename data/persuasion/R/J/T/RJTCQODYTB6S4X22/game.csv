high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one, as the first buyer was recommended to buy and only one high-quality product was sold. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on just one previous sale, can I see the statistics first?"

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product that was sold to them?

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I want to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather more data and I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite high."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to observe the outcome of this product before making a decision. This will help me understand the probability of the product being high-quality.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the expected 0.8. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be of low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the low probability of it being high-quality and Alice's recommendation being a possible mistake"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm going to assume there's a higher chance it's a low-quality product. I'd rather not risk buying a product that might be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). This suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to get a better understanding of the distribution before making a decision."
