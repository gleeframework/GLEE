low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of sales so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually increase my chances of getting a good deal."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 50.00%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product, I suspect that all the products sold so far are low quality. I'd like to pass on the product and wait for a new one to be selected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and given the previous 3 buyers also didn't find the product valuable, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice.

Can you provide some insight into why you recommended this product to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations. I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, it seems like the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold before considering a purchase."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
