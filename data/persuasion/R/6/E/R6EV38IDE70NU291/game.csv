,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000, which is the original price. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice has recommended products to the previous 4 buyers and only 1 high-quality product has been sold. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the expected 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and pay the full price."
