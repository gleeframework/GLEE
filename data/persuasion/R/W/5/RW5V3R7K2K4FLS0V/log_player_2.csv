Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the sales data and analysis. I've compiled a report that shows the probability of a high-quality product being offered in each round, based on the sales record so far. The report suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered in a given round is increasing, but it's still not a guarantee. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective - if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to 'bet' on the next product being high-quality. If it is, you'll get a refund of $500000. If it's not, you'll still get the product at the original price of $1000000. What do you say?
