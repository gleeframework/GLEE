**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The data indicates a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations. This strongly suggests her recommendations are accurate.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0).
* **Limited Information:** While we don't know the total number of products sold, the fact that 4 buyers have purchased with a 100% success rate is a very strong signal.

Therefore, it's highly likely that the product offered is of high quality, and it makes sense to accept Alice's recommendation and buy the product."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record is excellent:** All 8 products sold previously were high quality. This indicates Alice is likely recommending high-quality products, even if she knows the actual quality of the product.
* **High Potential Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential $12,500 profit from a high-quality product significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one.
* **No Information Loss by Passing:**  If you pass, you lose the opportunity to buy the product. There's no guarantee a better product will be offered later. 

While there's a risk, the positive factors strongly favor taking the product."
