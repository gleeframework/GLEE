high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products might have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
