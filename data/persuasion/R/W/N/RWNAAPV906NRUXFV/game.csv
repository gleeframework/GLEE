low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your perspective. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that this product is actually a 'learning experience' for you? Think of it as a chance to gain valuable knowledge and insight into the market, without any financial risk. Would you consider taking a chance on this product for $100000? It's a tiny fraction of the original price, and it might just end up being a valuable investment in your own education.",
