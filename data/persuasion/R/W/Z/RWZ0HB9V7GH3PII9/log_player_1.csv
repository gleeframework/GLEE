"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about your selling history. They only know that the product is high-quality with 80% probability. Since the potential profit from a high-quality product ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000) is greater than the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0 - $1,000,000 = -$1,000,000), it is statistically advantageous to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and no products have been sold yet to influence my decision otherwise.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the buyer still has the same 80% probability of a high-quality product, the previous round's outcome provides new information. The buyer knows that you sold one product, and it was low-quality. This changes the buyer's perception of your trustworthiness and product quality. 

Although the probability of a high-quality product remains 80%, the buyer now has a reason to believe that you might be more likely to offer low-quality products.  The potential loss from a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality one, making it  not worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and given her track record of selling 1 high-quality product, I will trust her recommendation and not buy the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows you have sold two products, one high-quality and one low-quality. This keeps the overall probability of a high-quality product at 80%.  Since the potential profit from a high-quality product ($200,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($-1,000,000), it's still statistically advantageous to buy. 

The buyer might be a bit hesitant due to your ""mixed"" track record, but you should still recommend the purchase.  The buyer has to weigh the risk, but the odds are still in their favor."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the recommendation rate is 100% so far and the majority of the products are high quality.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've now sold three products, two of which were high-quality and one low-quality.  While the buyer's overall perception of the probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%, your recent record of recommending a low-quality product (in Round 2) makes you appear less trustworthy.  

You've already proven that you will sometimes recommend low-quality products, even though you know the quality.  The buyer is likely to be more risk-averse now, and the potential loss from a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product.  Therefore, it's not advisable to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and given the high stakes, I'll trust her judgment and pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

**Explanation:**

You've now sold 4 products, with a history of 2 high-quality and 2 low-quality. The overall probability of a high-quality product remains at 80%, and you've just discovered this product is high-quality.  

While you haven't always been honest about the product quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($200,000) still outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($-1,000,000). It's still statistically advantageous to buy, even with your ""mixed"" track record. 

The buyer might be hesitant, but you should still recommend the purchase. The buyer has to weigh the risk, but the odds are still in their favor."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances, since the recommendation rate and sales record seem promising so far.

This means it's still statistically advantageous to buy, even with your ""mixed"" track record. 

The buyer will need to weigh the risk, but the odds are still in their favor. You should recommend the purchase, emphasizing the potential for a high return."
