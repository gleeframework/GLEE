Alice's message: I understand you're cautious. Let me offer you a different perspective. Since you're my third customer, I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. This means I still have a 2/3 chance of selling you a high-quality product. I'm willing to take that risk and offer you this product for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a potentially high-quality product at a fixed price.
