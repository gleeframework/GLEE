,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision with such a high probability of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since I'm the first buyer and have no information to go on. I'll just have to rely on my initial intuition."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the fact that all products are worth $0 to me if they're low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential $40000 gain of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Given your previous recommendations have been wrong, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product to see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your past recommendations, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the seller's previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, and that you are not recommended to buy it, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on it."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 attempts, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
