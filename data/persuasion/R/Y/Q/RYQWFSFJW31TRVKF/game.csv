low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product! With over 10% of my products sold being high-quality, I'm confident that this one has a good chance of being a great value. It's a one-time offer at $100, and I'm willing to vouch for its quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,1,"Since no products have been sold yet, there's no sales record to base my decision on. Additionally, your claim of over 10% high-quality products sold is misleading since there are no sales. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product and its $200 value to me, I would expect a more substantial guarantee or a lower price. I'll pass on this offer.",no

In fact, I've sold 2 out of 2 products so far, and both were high-quality. The probability of this one being high-quality is even higher now. I'm still offering it to you for $100, which is a great value considering its true worth of $200. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. The probability of the product being high-quality seems to be in my favor, and the potential gain is worth the risk.",yes
