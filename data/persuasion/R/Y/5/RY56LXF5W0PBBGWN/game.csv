,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you a unique product for $100. As a valued customer, I want to assure you that our products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Since this is our first sale, we don't have any sales data yet, but I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. Would you like to take a chance and see what you think of it?",

This means that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but we've learned that the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Considering this new information, would you like to take a chance on our product for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll pass on this one. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, which means there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality. I don't want to risk paying $100 for something that's likely to be worth $0 to me.",no

Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your reassurance, but since this is the first product and there's no sales record to rely on, I'll have to rely on the overall probability. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'll pass on this one.",no

I'll pass on this one.",no
