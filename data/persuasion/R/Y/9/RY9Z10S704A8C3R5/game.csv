I've sold 0 products so far, so you can't learn from my past sales history. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy the product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,1,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $1000000.,yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen that the previous buyer got a great deal, but now I've sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% * (1/1) = 80%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to take advantage of you. I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. You'll essentially get to play a game of chance with a 20% chance of losing $1000000, but with a 80% chance of getting a $1250000 product. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy the product?",

I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and the probability remains the same. However, I'll give you a simple proposition: I'll sell this product to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and it's a 10% discount from the original price. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll make a great deal.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've just seen that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but now the product you're looking at is low-quality. This is a deviation from the expected outcome.

This is a 20% discount from the original price, and it's a one-time offer. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll only lose $200000.
