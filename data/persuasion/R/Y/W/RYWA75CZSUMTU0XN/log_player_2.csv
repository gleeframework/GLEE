``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know one high-quality product has been sold. This is not enough information to confidently assess the current product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which suggests she believes it is of high quality.  
* **Potential Value:** Even though the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $2000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** As the second buyer, there's no opportunity cost in buying. If we pass, the product is discarded. 

**Overall, the potential reward of buying the product outweighs the risk, especially considering Alice's recommendation.**"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While 2 out of 3 previous buyers received high-quality products, the sample size is still very small.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a significant piece of information. Since Alice has access to the product's quality and wants to sell it, this suggests a higher probability of it being high-quality.  
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on the limited information available. In a real-world scenario, a buyer would likely seek more information or negotiate a lower price to mitigate risk."
