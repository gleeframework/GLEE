low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, a rare opportunity to buy a product from me. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. It's a great deal!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to take the chance, but I'll only pay if the product is high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pass.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I'm glad you know that I have a track record of selling high-quality products. This one is just as good, I assure you. It's a $300 product, but I'm only asking for $100. It's a steal!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll give you a statistic: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold so far. The odds are clearly in your favor. This one is just as good as the last one, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. It's a great opportunity to double your chances of getting a high-quality product!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. Thank you for the information, Alice!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold so far. The pattern is clear: every product I sell is high-quality. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this streak going, so you'd be wise to take advantage of this opportunity. This one is just as good as the last two, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're skeptical, but let's look at the facts: I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, and I've sold a total of 4 products. The probability of this being a fluke is extremely low. I'm not trying to manipulate you, I'm just offering you a great deal. This product is worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. It's a no-brainer.",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced by the statistics. I think it's too early to conclude that the products are high-quality. I'd like to wait and see more sales before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a cautious buyer. I don't blame you. I've sold 4 products in total, and 3 of them were high-quality. But I've also sold 1 low-quality product, which means I'm not perfect. In fact, I'm a bit of a wild card. You're taking a risk either way, but I'm willing to let you have this product for $100. It's a chance to take a flyer on a potentially great deal.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the risk, Alice. I'm willing to roll the dice and hope for a high-quality product. I'm excited to see what I get!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took a chance! And it paid off. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold so far. The odds are clearly in your favor. But don't get too comfortable - I've still got one more product left, and I'm not sure what it is. This one is just as good as the last 4, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. It's a great opportunity to make it 5 for 6.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the chance! I've been lucky so far, and I'd like to keep the streak going.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Well, I guess I'm due for a correction. I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but now I've sold a total of 6 products and only 5 of them were high-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - I've got a 50/50 shot at selling you a high-quality product. But I'm still willing to let you have it for $100. It's a risk, but it's a risk worth taking.",
,,the buyer,8,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping the streak continues!,yes

It's clear that I'm not perfect, and I've got a 50/50 shot at selling you a high-quality product. But I'm still willing to let you have this product for $100.

I've got to be honest with you, I'm starting to feel like I'm on a hot streak. This one is just as good as the last 7, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I think I've made it clear by now that I'm a bit of a wild card. 8 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 13 total products sold. I'm not going to promise you anything, but I am willing to let you have this product for $100. It's a chance to take a risk and potentially get a great deal, or to avoid a loss. Your call.",
