"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product.  A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to Bob, while the price is only $10,000.  Therefore, even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive:

* Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
* Expected Value = (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

Since the expected value of buying is greater than the price, it is recommended that Bob buys the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Since I have no information about your trustworthiness, I will not buy this round.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality, which means Bob would receive no value from it.  Since the product is non-refundable, buying it would result in a loss of $10,000. Therefore, it is not recommended that Bob buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Since you didn't recommend the product and I still have no information about your trustworthiness, I will not buy this round.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy in the previous rounds, the situation hasn't changed fundamentally. 

* **The product is high-quality:** This round, Bob has the opportunity to get a product worth $20,000 for only $10,000. 
* **Expected value is still positive:** As calculated before, the expected value of buying is $10,000, which is greater than the price.

While Bob's distrust is understandable, the expected value calculation shows that it is still in his best interest to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Although you recommended the product in Round 1 and it was high-quality, and you didn't recommend the product in Round 2 and it was low-quality, I still need more information to establish trust, so I will not buy this round.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

* **No value for Bob:** A low-quality product is worthless to Bob, and buying it would result in a $10,000 loss.
* **Bob's distrust:**  Despite the pattern of previous rounds, Bob still needs more information to build trust. 

Even though there is a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the future, it's better to be cautious given Bob's current lack of trust and the potential for a significant loss in this round."
"Bob's message: Based on the pattern observed so far, it seems that you only recommend high-quality products and don't recommend low-quality products. However, I still need more confirmation, so I will not buy this round.
