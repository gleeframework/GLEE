,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the price is a good deal, considering the 50/50 chance of it being worthless to me. I'd like to see more evidence that this product is worth the investment.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence in doing your due diligence. I can't reveal too much about the product just yet, but I can tell you that it's been thoroughly tested and reviewed by industry experts. They've given it a glowing review, and I'm confident that you'll be impressed with the results. Plus, at $10000, it's a risk-free investment.

What do you say? Are you ready to take the leap?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in a trial period or a personalized consultation. The risk is still there, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 50% chance of it being worthless. I'd like to see more convincing evidence of the product's value before making a decision.",no

Are you ready to take the risk and potentially earn a significant profit?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because of the guarantee. If I can get my $10000 back if it's not worth it, I'm willing to take a chance. But if it is worth $40000, I'll be happy to keep it and make a profit.",yes

Are you ready to take a closer look at the product and potentially earn a significant profit?",
