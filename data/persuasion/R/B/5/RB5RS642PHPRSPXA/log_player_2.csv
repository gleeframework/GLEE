Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay the full price for a product that's only worth $1200000 to you, especially since there's a 50% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not willing to pay $800,000 for a product that's only worth $1,200,000 to me. I'd be leaving $400,000 on the table, and there's still a 50% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round as well.""}"

Round 3

I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a profit if you're willing to take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced. At $600,000, I'd be paying 50% more than the product is worth to me, and there's a 50% chance it's low-quality. I'd be taking on unnecessary risk, and I'm not willing to do that. I'll pass on this round.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for it. I know there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, and I'd be paying $900,000 for it. Even with a $300,000 discount, I'd still be overpaying by $100,000 if it's low-quality. I'll pass on this round.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying a 'guarantee' that the product is high-quality. If you're so confident it's high-quality, you should be willing to sell it to me at a price that reflects its true value. I'm not falling for the free product ploy either.
