low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I understand your curiosity about the high-quality products. The 4 high-quality products were sold at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 9th positions in the sequence. What's interesting is that the high-quality products were spaced relatively evenly throughout the sequence, with 2-3 low-quality products in between each high-quality product. This suggests that the high-quality products are not clustered together, but rather are distributed randomly throughout the sequence. I'm still offering this next product to you for $1000000.
