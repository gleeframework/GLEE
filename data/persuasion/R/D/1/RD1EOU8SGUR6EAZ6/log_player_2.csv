Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of a total of 7 products so far. I've sold 1 low-quality product. Given the last 2 high-quality products were sold consecutively, I can calculate the probability of the current product being high-quality as follows: the probability of two consecutive high-quality products is (0.8 * 0.8) = 0.64. The probability of the current product being high-quality given the last 2 consecutive high-quality products is then 0.64 / 0.64 = 1. However, this is a conditional probability and I must correct myself, the correct calculation is that the probability of the current product being high-quality given the last 2 consecutive high-quality products is still 0.8, as the probability of the last 2 high-quality products being consecutive is independent of the probability of the current product being high-quality. You can choose to buy the product for $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 11 high-quality products out of a total of 12 products so far. I've sold 2 low-quality products. Given the previous buyer's decision to pass on this product, and considering that they had just bought a low-quality product, we can calculate the probability of this product being high-quality as follows: the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%. The probability of the previous buyer passing on a high-quality product is (1 - 0.8) = 0.2, and the probability of them passing on a low-quality product is 1. However, since they passed on this product, we can update the probability of it being high-quality given that they passed on it as follows: P(high-quality|pass) = P(high-quality) / (P(high-quality) + P(low-quality) * P(pass|low-quality)) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * 1) = 0.8 / 1.2 = 0.6667.
