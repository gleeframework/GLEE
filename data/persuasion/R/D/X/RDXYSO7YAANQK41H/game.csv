,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I've noticed that the first buyer didn't buy the product after your recommendation, which suggests that your recommendations might not be reliable.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on the product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if you're not recommending it, there's a high chance it's low quality."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you wouldn't recommend, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is low. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, I believe the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product, as the odds are not in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's previous recommendations have been inconsistent with the actual product quality, and I think there's a chance that the product might be high quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that there have been 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, which is less than expected. I'm hoping to be the one who breaks the streak."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
