,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to have you here. I understand you're interested in knowing more about my sales record. To be transparent, I've sold 2 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're considering the offer, but I'd like to give you a bit more context. Since you're aware of the 66.67% success rate, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers is on our side. With each new product, the probability of it being high-quality increases, and the chances of it being low-quality decrease.

I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5, but that doesn't mean the next one will be high-quality. In fact, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but the law of large numbers is not a guarantee. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it's a great value, regardless of its quality. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a string of successes, and it's possible that the next one might not be as lucky. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product?",
