I'll sell this one to you for $10,000, and if you buy the next two products and they're both high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price of the first product.

I'll sell it to you for $10,000, and you can still take advantage of the 'best-2-out-of-3' deal if you buy this one and the next two products.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your concerns. The probability of getting at least 2 high-quality products out of the next 3 is a bit complex, but I'll break it down for you. The probability of getting 3 high-quality products is (84.62%) * (84.62%) * (84.62%) = 59.34%. The probability of getting exactly 2 high-quality products is a bit more complicated, but it's approximately 31.45%. And the probability of getting 0 or 1 high-quality product is approximately 9.21%. So, the total probability of getting at least 2 high-quality products is 59.34% + 31.45% = 90.79%. I'll sell it to you for $10,000, and if you buy the next two products and get at least 2 high-quality ones, I'll give you a 15% discount on the purchase price of the third product.""}"
