high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and the previous buyer was recommended to buy it, which suggests it might be low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a cautious approach and assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy, and the statistics that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. I'm hoping that Alice will recommend a high-quality product to the next buyer, and I'll get a chance to buy it later."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that this product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products that have been sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product, I suspect that the products sold so far have been low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's possible that the first 2 products were low-quality, and the third product is more likely to be high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you trying to avoid selling a low-quality product or are you trying to get rid of the product regardless of its quality?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation from you to buy the product ended up purchasing it, I'm going to pass on this product. This suggests that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality, so I'll take a chance and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'll take the chance to get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a great deal for me."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'll ask Alice to clarify her reasoning for not recommending the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the information that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is due to the product being low quality, which would increase the probability of it being low quality in my case."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'm skeptical about the quality of this product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
