**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  The only data point is that one buyer purchased a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend high-quality products, as this would lead to more sales and a better reputation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $120 product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product.

**This decision is a gamble, but based on the limited information, it's a calculated risk worth taking.**"
