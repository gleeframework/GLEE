}"

I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering this new product to you at the fixed price of $10000. You can use the information from my previous sales to inform your decision, but keep in mind that the underlying probability remains the same.""

I'm offering this new product to you at a fixed price of $10000. I'd like to remind you that the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold should converge to the underlying probability as the sample size increases. I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to buy a product at a fixed price.""

However, since I'm the 8th buyer and 7 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% because the previous buyers have already 'filtered out' the low-quality products, leaving only the high-quality ones in the remaining stock.

You can use this information to inform your decision.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the sales record and the law of large numbers. However, I'd like to point out that the number of sales is still relatively low, and the proportion of high-quality products sold (2/11) is not significantly different from the underlying probability (1/3).
