low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to buy it. I think the fact that you don't recommend it and that no high-quality products have been sold yet is a good indication that the product is likely low-quality.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and your recommendation.

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet. I suspect Alice might be recommending low-quality products to manipulate the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products, and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
