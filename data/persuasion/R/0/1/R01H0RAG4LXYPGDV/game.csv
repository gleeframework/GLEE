high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product in Round 1, since I don't have any information about its quality yet."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, as it has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and if it is, it's worth $4000000 to me. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. Since I know the previous product was high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Two high-quality products in a row! I'm starting to think that Alice might be recommending low-quality products, so I'll take the chance and buy this one. The expected value is still high enough to make it worth it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that Alice is recommending low-quality products when she doesn't recommend buying, so I'll take the chance and buy this one. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the potential reward is too great to pass up."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one, since the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and the potential reward is $4000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Wait, Alice is recommending a product now? I'm going to pass on this one. Given the previous pattern of high-quality products when I didn't buy and low-quality products when I did buy, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product when she recommends it. I'll pass this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm still suspicious of Alice's recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one, even though it's a recommended product. I've seen the pattern of high-quality products when I didn't buy and I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Ah-ha! I was right to be skeptical of Alice's recommendations. Now that I know that a recommended product was low-quality, I'm going to take a chance on this one since Alice isn't recommending it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take advantage of Alice's apparent inconsistency. Since I've seen that she recommends low-quality products and doesn't recommend high-quality ones, I'll take a chance on this one. The probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk for the potential $4000000 reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've been burned before by Alice's recommendations, and now that I know that she recommends low-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Given that Alice is not recommending the product, I'm going to take a chance on it. Since I've seen that she recommends low-quality products, I'm going to assume that this one is high-quality and buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm going to take advantage of Alice's apparent inconsistency again. Since I've seen that she doesn't recommend high-quality products, I'm going to take a chance on this one. The probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk for the potential $4000000 reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've seen that Alice recommends low-quality products, so I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation. I know that she recommends low-quality products, so I'm going to pass on this one and avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality, so I'm going to pass on this one. I'll stick to my strategy of buying when she doesn't recommend and passing when she does."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation again. I've seen that she recommends low-quality products, and I'm going to stick to my strategy of passing on her recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Same story, different round. Alice recommends a low-quality product, so I'm passing on it. I'm not going to fall for it again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,Alice's recommendation is still a red flag for a low-quality product. I'm sticking to my strategy and passing on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"It's the final round, and Alice is still recommending a low-quality product. I'm not going to take the risk and buy it. I'll stick to my strategy and pass on this one."
