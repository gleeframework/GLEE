,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data to be available before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold, to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality given the previous sales record.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product, and it was a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. However, considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 0.8, I think it's likely that there are more high-quality products remaining in the inventory. If I pass on the product, it may increase the proportion of high-quality products sold in the statistics, making it more likely for future buyers to purchase a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a slightly lower proportion of high-quality products than the expected 80.00%. I'd like to wait and observe more sales before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
