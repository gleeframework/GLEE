,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't buy it. This makes me suspect that the previous product was low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,"By the way, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. This one is actually a high-quality product, I assure you!"
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This makes me suspicious that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"I understand your skepticism. As of now, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products. I'm not recommending this one, but I want to be transparent about the sales statistics."
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a contrarian and I think Alice's recommendation is a bad sign. I'm hoping the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"I see you're a contrarian! Well, I'm here to inform you that this product is actually low-quality. Maybe this is a chance to reevaluate your contrarian strategy?"
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and considering the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality and the reasoning behind Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"As I've mentioned before, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not recommending this product, but I'll let you decide for yourself."
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's low quality?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,I'm trying to strike a balance between recommending high-quality products and avoiding low-quality ones. I think this one is worth considering.
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,I'm afraid this product is low-quality. I'm not recommending it.
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds are still in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"You've made your decision, and I respect that. Good luck with your purchase."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy after your recommendation, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33% since you would have recommended it to the previous buyers if it was high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"You've done your math, and you're willing to take the risk. I respect that. Good luck with your purchase."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"You've made your decision, and I respect that. This product is indeed low-quality, as you can see now."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I think you might be overestimating the proportion of high-quality products, and I'm trying to exploit that by buying the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"You're trying to exploit my strategy, and I respect that. This product is indeed low-quality, as you can see now."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,This product is low-quality. I'm not recommending it.
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"You're willing to take a risk, and it looks like it's paying off this time. This product is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% chance I was initially told. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"You're waiting for more data, and I understand that. This product is indeed low-quality, as you can see now."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"This is a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality product. I'm recommending it to you, and I think you should consider it."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 7 previous sales, I'm concerned that the low-quality products may have been sold first, and the high-quality products may still be available. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I see your point, but this is indeed a high-quality product. I'm recommending it to you, and I think you should consider it."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she hasn't sold any high-quality products yet, so she's likely recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"You think you've figured out my strategy, and you're waiting for more information. This product is indeed low-quality, as you can see now."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,20,yes,"You've made an informed decision, and it looks like it's paying off this time. This product is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 products recommended were of low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
