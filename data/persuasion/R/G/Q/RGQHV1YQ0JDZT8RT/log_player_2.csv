Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product! Since you've decided not to purchase this high-quality item, we're happy to provide you with the updated statistics.

Despite this, we're still confident that our products are of high quality, and we're offering this new high-quality product for $10000. We believe that the potential reward is still worth the risk.
