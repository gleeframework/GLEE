"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, it's always best to err on the side of caution when there's uncertainty. Here's why:

* **Unknown Value:** You don't know how much the low-quality product is worth to the buyer. It could be worthless, or it could have some small value.
* **High Risk, High Price:** The product is being offered for $1,000,000.  This is a huge risk for the buyer, especially with the 66.67% chance the product is low-quality. 
* **No Information:**  The buyer has no information about this specific product or your track record. 

Therefore, it's not a good decision to recommend buying this product. The buyer is taking on a significant risk for an unknown reward."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I understand this is the first product, I'm hesitant to purchase without any data on the product's quality.  I'll pass for now and see how the next few sales go.

* **No Information:**  The buyer has no information about this specific product.  Even though they've observed one sale, it was a non-purchase, providing no additional insight into product quality.

It's still not a good decision to recommend buying.  The buyer is still taking on a significant risk for an unknown reward."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there is no sales history to analyze and your recommendation is to pass, I'll decline the purchase.  I'm happy to see what you offer in the future.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

While this round's product is high-quality, it's still not a good idea to recommend buying it. Here's why:
