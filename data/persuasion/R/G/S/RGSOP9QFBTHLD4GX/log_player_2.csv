Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! After selling 1 high-quality product, I'm excited to offer you another chance to make a deal. Since the first product was high-quality, you might think it's a good idea to take a chance on this one too. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the law of averages suggests that the next product might not be as lucky. Are you willing to take the risk and potentially lose $1000000?
