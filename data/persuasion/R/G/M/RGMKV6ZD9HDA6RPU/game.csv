high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that Alice recommends buying a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality suggests that she may not have a good understanding of the product's quality or my valuation."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're recommending based on the product's quality or just trying to discourage me from buying. I'll take the risk and see if I can get a good deal."
