,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records and you know the true quality of the product, I'm assuming your recommendation is based on that. However, without any prior data to establish trust, I'll pass on this product."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation. Given the product's 50% chance of being high or low quality and its worth to me ($20000 for high quality, $0 for low quality), the expected value is $10000, which equals the asking price. Without additional information, I won't take the risk."
