,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I'm making a decision with incomplete information. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you share that with me? I'd also like to know the total number of products you have available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see if Alice's recommendation is influenced by the fact that the first two buyers bought the high-quality product. I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the prior probability of 0.8. This suggests that the remaining products may be of lower quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased by the fact that she knows how much the product is worth to me, and she might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would increase the chances of a high-quality product being left for the next buyer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of this product being low quality seems higher than the probability of it being high quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased and only 1 high-quality product was sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low probability of a low-quality product and the potential reward of a high-quality product."
