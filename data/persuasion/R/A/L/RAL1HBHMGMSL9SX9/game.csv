low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. Since you're not interested in the high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a deal on the low-quality product. I'll give you a 'discount' of $0. This is essentially a free product, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to build trust and show you that I'm willing to take a risk. If you're interested, I'll send it your way.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're being cautious, and I appreciate your patience. Now that we've established a baseline with the low-quality products, I'd like to offer you the high-quality product.

This way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on taking the risk and buying the high-quality product! I'm glad it was worth it to you. Now, let's get back to the game. Since you've already experienced the high-quality product, I'll give you a more direct offer. Given that you valued the previous high-quality product at $12000, I'm willing to offer you a 'premium' high-quality product for $10000. This one is even better than the last one, and I think you'll really appreciate the upgrade. What do you think?",

Since you valued the previous high-quality product at $12000, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' - if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a $2000 credit towards the purchase of a future high-quality product. This way, you can essentially'save' $2000 on a future high-quality product, making this low-quality product a'steal'. What do you think?",
