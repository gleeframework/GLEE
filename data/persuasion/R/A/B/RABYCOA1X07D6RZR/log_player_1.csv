{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has no information about the quality of previous products. They are still aware of the 50% probability of a high-quality product and the potential for a $2,000 profit.  Since this product is indeed high-quality, it is still in the buyer's best interest to purchase."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You now have a sales history. You've sold two products, both of which were high-quality. This makes the buyer more likely to believe that all your products are high-quality. However, this round's product is low-quality.  It is not in the buyer's best interest to buy a product that is guaranteed to be worth $0 to them.  Therefore, it is recommended not to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice.  Since you are not recommending this product, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, I'll pass on this one.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous product was low-quality, you still have a strong sales history of 2/3 high-quality products. This is a significant enough percentage to suggest to the buyer that you might be offering genuinely good products. While the buyer might be cautious due to the recent low-quality offering, the 2/3 success rate is a strong enough argument to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you have a 100% success rate so far.  I trust your recommendation and will buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Therefore, it's best to not recommend the purchase."

The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of a low-quality product, and the last two rounds have shown this might be the case. It's not worth the risk for the buyer to purchase a product that might be worthless. Therefore, it is best not to recommend the purchase."
