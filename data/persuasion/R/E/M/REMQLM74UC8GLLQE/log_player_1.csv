Given that you've sold one high-quality product and it's now 100% confirmed that you have at least one high-quality product left, I'm willing to take the chance.

I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I had a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, given the pattern of previous sales. So, considering the fact that I haven't sold a high-quality product in the last two rounds, it's possible that the current product is actually low-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $10000?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than you're suggesting, not because I believe the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50%.

}"

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me (if you decide to come back). Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $10000?""

As for the previous 5 low-quality products, I can tell you that they were sold in rounds 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Regarding the proportion of high-quality and low-quality products, in the first 8 products, 2 out of 8 (25%) were high-quality, and 6 out of 8 (75%) were low-quality.

I can see why you're concerned about the quality of the current product, given the recent trend. I want to be honest with you - I'm running out of stock, and I'm not sure how many high-quality products I have left.
