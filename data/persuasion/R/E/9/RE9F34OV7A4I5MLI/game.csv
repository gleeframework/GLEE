,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%, and I'm willing to take that chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'll pass and see what Alice recommends to the next buyer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is not high enough, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many total products have been offered so far, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging purchases, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the probability of the current product being high quality is 0.2. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold (1/4), I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the probability of the product being low-quality is still quite high."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the high-quality product sold was just a lucky draw, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still relatively low. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product after your recommendation, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.
