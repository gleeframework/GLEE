Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold two products so far, and I'm pleased to say that both of them were indeed high-quality. Given this information, you can update the probability of this current product being high-quality using Bayes' theorem. Assuming the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and considering that both previous products were high-quality, the updated probability would be (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) / ((0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) + (0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2)) ≈ 0.946.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold thirteen products so far, with eleven of them being high-quality. I appreciate your attention to detail and your question about the probability calculation.

The correct probability calculation is indeed 11/13 = 0.8462.
