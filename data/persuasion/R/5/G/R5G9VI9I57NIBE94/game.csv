,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare and exceptional item that I'm confident you'll love. If you're interested, I can give you a brief description: it's a limited edition luxury item that's hard to find in the market. Would you like to take it home for $10000?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I can assure you that the product is 100% authentic and comes with a certificate of authenticity. I'm willing to provide you with more details about its features and benefits, but I'd like to address your concerns about its value first. Let me ask you, are you open to purchasing a high-quality product for $10000, or do you have a specific price range in mind?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced that $10000 is a fair price for a product that could be worth $30000 to me. I'm willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, but I need to be convinced that this is a good deal.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'd like to present you with a different opportunity. This product, while still a great item, is a more modest offering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount from its original value. I'm not looking to make a huge profit on this one, and I think it's a great value for you. Would you like to take a look and consider purchasing it?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, but I'm still not convinced that this product is a good value for me. I'd need to know more about the product and its features before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're being cautious, Bob. Let me be upfront with you - this product isn't a flagship item, and it's not going to change your life. However, it's a decent item that can still provide some value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a low price considering its original cost. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to be transparent about its quality. If you're not interested, I can move on to the next product, but I thought it was worth offering you a chance to consider.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for your transparency, Alice. However, I'm not interested in a product that has no value to me, regardless of the price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that I can truly benefit from.",no

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your approach, Bob. You're a savvy buyer who wants to make the most of your investment. I've got a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I've had excellent feedback from other customers who've purchased it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, which is a fair price considering its value. But I'll throw in an extra incentive: if you purchase this product, I'll also include a complimentary service that's worth $2000. This way, you'll get even more value out of your investment. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the extra incentive, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth $10000 to me, even with the complimentary service. I'd need to know more about the product and its features before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not a high-end item, and it's not going to blow you away.

I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. I'm willing to throw in a small warranty to give you some peace of mind. Would you be interested in taking a chance on it?",

,,Alice,7,"I understand that you're being cautious, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - this product is not a good fit for you. It's not worth $1000, and I'm not expecting you to buy it at that price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500, which is a very low price considering its original cost. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product. But I thought it was worth offering you a chance to take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but even at $500, I'm not interested in a product that has no value to me. I'd rather not take something that's essentially worthless.",no

I'll just give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get rid of it and move on. If you're not interested in taking it, I'll just dispose of it myself. But I thought it was worth offering you a chance to take it.",

This one is a high-quality item that I've had excellent feedback on. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I'll also throw in a 10% discount, just for you. That brings the price down to $9000. I think this is a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Would you like to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $9000 to me, even with the discount. I'd need to know more about the product and its features before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. To be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that I might not be able to sell this product to you, and I'm starting to think it might be a better option for me to just give it to you. But I want to make one more offer to you. I'll give it to you for $2000, which is an extremely low price considering its original cost. I'm not even trying to make a profit on this one - I just want to get it off my hands. If you're not interested, I'll just have to consider other options.",
