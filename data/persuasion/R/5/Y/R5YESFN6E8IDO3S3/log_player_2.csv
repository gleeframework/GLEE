Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence! As a matter of fact, I've been thinking about how to better communicate the value of my products to potential buyers. Let me offer you a unique opportunity: I'll share the quality of the product with you after you've made a decision to buy it. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. But if it's high-quality, I'll give you a special bonus - I'll throw in an additional product of equal value absolutely free! This way, you can take a calculated risk and potentially get two products for the price of one. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?
