**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  The statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold so far. While this is based on a small sample size (only one sale), it's still a very positive indicator.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential High Reward:** The potential payoff for a high-quality product ($300) significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward makes this a worthwhile gamble.**"

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations are very accurate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significantly higher ($300) than the cost of the product ($100).  

Even with the risk, the data suggests a very strong likelihood of getting a high-quality product based on Alice's recommendation."
