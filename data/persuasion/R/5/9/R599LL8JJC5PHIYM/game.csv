low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 25%. This is a relatively low probability, and I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy it for $100. It's a risk, but it might pay off!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take it, but I'm doing it based on the low probability of it being high-quality, not on your recommendation.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 20%. I've had a string of low-quality products, and I'm starting to think I might have just gotten unlucky. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 40%. I've had a mix of high and low-quality products, but the last two I've sold have been high-quality. I'm feeling optimistic about this one, and I think you should be too. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product for $100!",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 57.14%. I've got a clear trend going here, and I'm starting to think that I've got a higher proportion of high-quality products than the overall 50% average. This one might be a great opportunity to get a high-quality item for $100!",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by the trend. The sample size is still relatively small, and a single low-quality product could easily skew the statistics. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 8 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 62.5%.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 12 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.67%. I'll give you the information you asked for: the 7 high-quality products I've sold were sold in a streak of 5, 1, and 1.

I've taken into account the overall statistics, including the 61.54% probability of a high-quality product.

As for this one, I want to be upfront with you - I've had two low-quality products in a row, which is unusual for me. I'm not trying to hide anything, but I do want to be honest with you about the risks. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to discuss other options or wait for a better opportunity.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 16 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 62.5%. I'll answer your question: the 4 low-quality products were purchased by buyers who didn't have access to the sales record, and they were all willing to take a chance on the product without knowing the statistics. As for the buyers who did have access to the record, they were more cautious and waited for a better opportunity.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 18 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.67%. Unfortunately, the last product was low-quality, which means the offer I made to the previous buyer doesn't apply to you. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if there's something wrong with my inventory. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to warn you that the odds are not in your favor.",

I'm glad you were willing to take a risk on the last product, but I'm sorry to say that this one is also low-quality. I've had a disappointing streak of low-quality products, and I'm starting to worry that my inventory is not what I thought it was. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not confident in the quality of this product, and I'm not sure it's a good value for the price.",
,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the low-quality streak, I'm inclined to take a chance on this product. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to negotiate the price. Considering the low-quality product, I'm willing to offer $50 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the uncertainty surrounding its quality.",yes
