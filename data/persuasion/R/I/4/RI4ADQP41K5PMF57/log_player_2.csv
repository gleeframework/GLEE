"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if it's a good deal, considering the low probability of it being high-quality. I'll pass for now.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but this is a one-time opportunity to get a product at a significant discount. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is 1/3 of its true value. It's a risk-free investment, and I'm confident you won't regret it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced that the discounted price is a good value, considering the 20% chance of it being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. Let me sweeten the deal: I'll throw in a 10-year warranty and a premium after-sales support package, worth $5000. This way, you'll get the full value of the product, plus additional benefits, all for the same price of $10000. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The warranty and after-sales support are nice perks, but they don't change the fact that the product is still only worth $0 to me if it's low-quality.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to propose a different approach.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product. If the next product is low-quality, I'll get a refund, which is a good deal. I'll take the opportunity to buy this high-quality product now.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if the discount and bonus feature are enough to justify the risk of buying another product. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making another purchase.""}"

You'll essentially be getting two high-quality products for the price of one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the 'buy now' option.
