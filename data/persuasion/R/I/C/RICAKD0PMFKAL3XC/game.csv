high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that Alice recommends the product. I'm not convinced that it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first 3 products sold were all high-quality, so she's likely to recommend a high-quality product to the next buyer. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the current product is high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the trend continues or reverses."
