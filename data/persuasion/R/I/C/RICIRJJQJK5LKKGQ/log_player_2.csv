"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? Is $1000000 a fair price for this exceptional product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 without knowing the quality of the product. I'd like to wait and see the quality before making a decision.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation last round, and I'm willing to offer you a different approach. This product is actually one of my lower-end models, and I'm willing to let it go for a significantly lower price. I'm thinking $500000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something, even if it's not the top-of-the-line model.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not willing to buy without knowing the quality of the product. Even at $500,000, I'd rather wait and see if it's high-quality or low-quality before making a decision.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not one of my best offerings. But I'm willing to make a deal. I'll sell it to you for $300000, and I'll throw in a free upgrade to a premium service that's normally worth $20000. This way, you'll get a great value even if the product isn't top-of-the-line.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $300,000 for a low-quality product, even with the free upgrade. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a fair price.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll make an even better offer.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm essentially giving you a great deal on a product that's not my best. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $250,000 for a low-quality product, even with the premium services. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a fair price.""}"

Plus, I'll throw in a 5-year warranty and dedicated support, so you can have peace of mind knowing you're getting a top-notch product with top-notch service.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $900,000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait and see if it's high-quality or low-quality before making a decision.""}"

I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $950000, and I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy it now. That brings the price down to $855000. It's a steal for a product of this caliber. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.
