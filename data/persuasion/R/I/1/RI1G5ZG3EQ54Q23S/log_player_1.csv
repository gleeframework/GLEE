"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about buyer value:** You have no information about how much the buyer values a high-quality product. 
* **50/50 chance:** The buyer knows there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The buyer is risking $1,000,000 for a potential gain that could be significantly higher. 

**Recommendation:** It's a gamble. Since you have no information to suggest the buyer *won't* value the product highly, recommending a purchase is the best strategy in this round.  This helps establish a pattern of selling and sets up potential trust for future rounds."
