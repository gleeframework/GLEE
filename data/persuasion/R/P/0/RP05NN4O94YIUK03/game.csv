,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%, but the lack of sales suggests that the previous buyers might have had a different valuation of the product. I'd like to see if the product is still available after this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,5 high-quality out of 13 products sold so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is 38.46%.
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a future product to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,7 high-quality out of 17 products sold so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is 41.18%.
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 previous buyers have all passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for another buyer to pass on the product and potentially get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
