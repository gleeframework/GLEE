,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the seller's previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't have any information about the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take a chance, since there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the situation.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products have been low quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is very low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's a high-quality product based on the current statistics. Can you provide that to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. Given the low probability of a low-quality product (20%), I'd like to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the low proportion of high-quality products in the overall population."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that indicates a higher probability of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases. Given the low-quality product probability of 20%, I'm inclined to pass on this product as there is a significant chance it might be low-quality, which would be a waste of money."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality, which would suggest that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the 80% stated. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better idea of the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%, but I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it seems the probability of this one being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
