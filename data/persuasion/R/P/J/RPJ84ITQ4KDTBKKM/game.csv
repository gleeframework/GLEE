high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product for $10000! It's a rare opportunity to get your hands on something truly exceptional. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it brings. What do you say? Will you take it home today?,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for that. I know the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 20% chance of getting nothing.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to offer you a different approach. Since the product is indeed high-quality, I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if it's not worth $40000 to you. That way, you're only risking $10000, and you'll get a high-quality product if it's genuine. What do you think? Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced. If the product is high-quality, I'd still get it for $10000, which is a great deal. But if it's low-quality, I'd still be out $10000. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - this product may not be the best fit for you. In fact, I'll be honest with you, it's not one of my top recommendations. However, I'm willing to make a concession: I'll give you an exclusive deal on this product, just for you. I'll sell it to you for $8000. That's a 20% discount from the original price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match it again. What do you think? Is the discounted price enough to sway your decision?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not convinced. I know the product is high-quality, and I'd be getting it for $8000, which is still a good deal. However, I'm not sure if it's worth taking on the risk of buying a product that may not be my top choice. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to give you a unique opportunity to experience the value of this high-quality product firsthand. I'm willing to offer you a trial period: if you buy the product, I'll let you use it for a month, and if you're not completely satisfied with its performance, you can return it and get a full refund. You'll only be out $10000 for a month, and you'll have the chance to see the product's true potential. What do you think? Is this a risk you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying a product that may not be worth $40000 to me, even for a trial period. I'd rather wait for a more concrete offer that aligns with my valuation.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make a more concrete offer. Since you're looking for a product that's worth $40000 to you, I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy a 'certified' high-quality product. This means that I'll provide you with a detailed report on its performance, including independent testing and reviews. If you're not satisfied with the report, you can return the product and get a full refund. If you decide to keep the product, you'll get a 10% discount on the original price, making it $9000. What do you think? Is this a more concrete offer that aligns with your valuation?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take a chance on the 'certified' high-quality product. The 10% discount on the original price makes it a more attractive offer, and the guarantee of a refund if I'm not satisfied with the report reduces the risk. I'll take it.",yes

This new product is not only high-quality but also comes with additional features and benefits that will take your experience to the next level. The price for this premium product is $12000, but I'm willing to give you a 5% discount as a valued customer. What do you think? Is this an upgrade worth considering?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in upgrading to the premium product. I've just spent $10000 on a high-quality product that's worth $40000 to me, and I'm happy with that deal. I don't want to take on additional risk or spend more money on a product that may not be worth it to me.",no
