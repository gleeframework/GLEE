"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that 80% of products are high-quality, it's highly likely that this product is worth more to him than the $10,000 price.  While he doesn't know the exact value, the odds are in his favor.  It's a good gamble to take."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the product in the previous round, which means he likely found it valuable, even though he didn't know the exact quality at the time.  Since this round's product is also high-quality, it's highly likely to be even more valuable to Bob.  There's no reason to change the recommendation."

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob seems to be trusting your judgment, it's important to remember that the price is fixed, and there's no guarantee that a low-quality product will be worth $10,000 to him.  Given the potential for loss, it's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend buying this product."
