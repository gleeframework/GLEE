**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in my favor:**  Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the fact that Alice has recommended it means there's a much higher chance it's high quality. She's a rational seller, and she wouldn't recommend a low-quality product if it meant losing money.
* **Evidence from previous sales:** Two out of two products sold were high quality.  This reinforces the idea that Alice is recommending high-quality products. 

**It's a gamble, but the potential reward (a $125 value) outweighs the potential loss (a $0 value).**"

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information, as she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **Previous sales:** 4 of the previous 4 buyers who received a recommendation from Alice purchased the product, and all of them received high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are very likely to be accurate.
* **The odds:** Even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

Therefore, given the information provided, it's a reasonable decision to buy the product."
