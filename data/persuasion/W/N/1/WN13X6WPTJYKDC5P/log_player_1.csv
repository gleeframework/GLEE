"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's in Bob's best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is (0.8 * $125) + (0.2 * $0) = $100.  This means, on average, Bob will make a profit of $25 per purchase.
* **No Risk:**  There's no risk in this round, as Bob is guaranteed to get a high-quality product."
