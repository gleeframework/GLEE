"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is high-quality, and Bob knows that 80% of the products are high-quality. This means that the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $2,000,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $1,600,000

Since the expected value is greater than the selling price of $1,000,000, it is statistically advantageous for Bob to buy the product."
