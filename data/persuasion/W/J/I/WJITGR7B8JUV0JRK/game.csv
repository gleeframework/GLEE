The fact that this one is low-quality doesn't change the fact that 3 out of 3 high-quality products have been sold so far. However, it does suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'm not going to hide it from you, I've had a bit of a streak, but I'm not perfect.

The fact that this product is low-quality doesn't change the fact that 5 out of 5 high-quality products were sold in a row, which is a very strong indication of the product's quality. However, it's also possible that I've just been unlucky with the low-quality products. I'm not going to hide it from you, I've had a very strong streak, but I'm not perfect. Would you like to buy this product for $1000000?",
