**Explanation:**

* **The data is limited:** We only know that one buyer purchased a product, and it was high-quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she knows the true quality of the product. Since she recommends buying, there's a good chance it's high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($20,000) is high, while the potential loss ($10,000) is significant. However, with Alice's recommendation, the risk is mitigated.

**Overall:** Given the limited information, it's a gamble, but Alice's recommendation justifies taking the risk."
