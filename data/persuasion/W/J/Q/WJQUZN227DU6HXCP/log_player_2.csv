**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Belief:**  The initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a positive signal. While we don't know how Alice makes her recommendations, we can assume she has some information about the product's quality.
* **Limited Data:**  There's only one previous sale, so the data is limited.  However, the fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it was high-quality is a positive sign.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0).

**Overall:** The limited data and Alice's recommendation suggest a higher than average chance of a high-quality product. It's worth the risk to buy."
