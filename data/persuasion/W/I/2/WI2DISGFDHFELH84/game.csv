,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchases! Given the success of the last two high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $9000.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're enjoying the previous products! However, I want to be transparent with you about this next one. I've noticed that you've been buying from me regularly, and I'm willing to offer you a 'friend's discount' on this product. I'm selling it to you for $9500, which is a bit higher than the usual price. I think you'll still find it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the 'friend's discount' offer, I'm a bit hesitant to buy at this price.

I've been doing some research and I'm confident that this product is not as valuable as my usual offerings. I'm willing to sell it to you at a very low price of $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual price.
