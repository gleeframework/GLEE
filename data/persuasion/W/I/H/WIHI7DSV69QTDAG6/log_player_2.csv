**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** Since there's no sales history, we have no information on the actual quality of products Alice is offering. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a signal, albeit weak, that she believes the product is good.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is (0.3333 * $300) + (0.6667 * $0) = $100.  Since the product costs $100, the expected value is neutral.

**It's a gamble:** While the odds are against us, the recommendation and neutral expected value make it worthwhile to take a chance."
