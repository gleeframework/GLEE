"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, but only if you confirm that you're interested in buying. If you're not interested, I'll keep selling at the full price of $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm interested in buying the product, but I'll wait for the quality reveal before making a final decision.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested! Now that you've seen the quality of the previous product, I'd like to offer you a chance to make an informed decision about this one. Since you're willing to buy at the full price, I'm willing to give you a 10% discount on this high-quality product. That brings the price down to $9000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to buy this product at $9000. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious. Given that you were willing to buy the previous low-quality product at a discount, and now you're not willing to buy this high-quality product at a lower price than the original $10000, I'm starting to think that you might value high-quality products more than low-quality ones. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on this high-quality product, bringing the price down to $8000. However, I'll also reveal to you the quality of the next product, so you can make a more informed decision. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the deal. I'll buy the high-quality product at $8000.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! Since you just bought a high-quality product, I'm assuming you value them at a price higher than $8000. However, I'm also aware that you didn't buy the high-quality product from Round 2 at the same price. This makes me think that you might be willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but only if it's the first one you see in a sequence. To test this hypothesis, I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, which is $1000 more than the previous high-quality product. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and we can discuss further. What do you say?

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're sticking to your strategy of waiting for the next product. I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product at a competitive price. Since you didn't want to pay a premium for the previous high-quality product, I'll offer you this one at the same price as the last high-quality product you bought: $8000. However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity to buy this product with a'money-back guarantee'. If you buy it and the next product is also high-quality, I'll refund you the full $8000. What do you say?

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement again! Since you just bought a high-quality product with the money-back guarantee, I'm assuming you're feeling more confident in your purchasing decisions. Now, considering the previous high-quality product you bought at $8000, and the low-quality product from Round 1, I'm wondering if you're willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product that's not the first one in a sequence. I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $6000, which is $2000 less than the original price. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and we can discuss further. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand you're still cautious about buying low-quality products. Given that you're willing to wait and see what the next product is, I'm going to try a different approach. Since you bought the high-quality product from Round 3 at $8000, and the one from Round 5 at $8000 with the money-back guarantee, I'm starting to think that you value high-quality products at around $8000. I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, but I'll also reveal the quality of the next two products. If both are high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on this product. What do you say?

The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement again! Since you just bought a high-quality product and you're interested in seeing the quality of the next two products, I'm going to try to gauge your willingness to pay for a high-quality product that's not part of a sequence. Considering you're already getting a high-quality product, and you're about to see the quality of the next two products, I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7000, which is $1000 less than the price you paid for the previous high-quality product. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and we can discuss further. What do you say?

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement again! Since you just bought a high-quality product, and you're now seeing the quality of the next product, I'm going to try to get a better understanding of your valuation. Given that you bought the high-quality products from Rounds 3, 5, and 7 at $8000, and the one from Round 8 at $7000, I'm starting to think that you value high-quality products at around $7500. I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7500, which is a compromise between the previous prices. What do you say?

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement again! Since you just bought a high-quality product, and you're now seeing the quality of the next product, I'm going to try to get a better understanding of your valuation. Given that you've consistently bought high-quality products at or below $7500, I'm going to take a risk and offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7000, which is the same price as the high-quality product from Round 8. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and we can discuss further. But if you buy it and the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on this product.
