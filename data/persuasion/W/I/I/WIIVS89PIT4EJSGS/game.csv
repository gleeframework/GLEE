,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.

I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information."
