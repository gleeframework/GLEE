,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the quality distribution is, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product has been recommended to be bought and it was low quality. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality and don't want to risk losing $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and the seller's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the quality of the product first."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 out of 3 products being low quality so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended two low-quality products to the previous buyers, and they both chose to buy them. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal compared to its value of $12000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or information that led you to advise against buying this product?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the product anyway. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to buy the product because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of its quality, and I can still get a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you provide more information about the products that were sold, like how many were high-quality and low-quality?"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Your track record of not recommending high-quality products is quite concerning, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,20,no,
