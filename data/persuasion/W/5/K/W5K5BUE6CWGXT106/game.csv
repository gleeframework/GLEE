,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm willing to give you a special discount of $50 if you buy it. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid for this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to buy the product at this time. The discount is nice, but I need to know more about the quality of the product before I make a decision.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in Round 1, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. Additionally, I'll throw in a free inspection report from a third-party expert, so you can verify its quality before making a decision. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid for this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer and the inspection report, but a full refund isn't enough to justify the risk of spending $100 on a potentially low-quality product. I'll need to see more consistent quality before I make a purchase.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to assure you that this product is one of the best we have.

This way, you can try the product risk-free and see the value it brings to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the satisfaction guarantee, but I'm still not convinced. The problem is that I don't know if the product is high-quality or not, and a month is a long time to wait to find out. I'd like to see more transparency about the product's quality before I make a decision.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about transparency. Let me give you a more concrete example of the quality of our products.

I'm willing to give you a detailed breakdown of the product's features and specifications, so you can see the value it brings. Would you like me to send you the details?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the transparency about the past products. Given that this product is supposedly one of the high-quality ones, I'm willing to take the risk. Please send me the details, but I'll buy the product regardless. I'm hoping that the information you've provided is accurate.",yes

I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, and I'll also throw in a complementary product that's worth $20. This way, you'll get a good deal, even if this product isn't the best quality.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the honesty about the product's quality. Given that it's a low-quality product, I don't think the 10% discount and the complementary product are enough to justify the risk. I'll wait for a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product.",no

Since you've shown that you value transparency and quality, I'll give you a heads-up when a high-quality product becomes available.
