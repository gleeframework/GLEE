low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you're not recommending it, as I don't have any information yet about its quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying the product, even though you recommend it, because I've already experienced a low-quality product in the previous round, and I don't want to risk losing another $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since you're recommending it and I've already had one low-quality product and one high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the bait and buy the product, since you're recommending it and my last two purchases were both high-quality products."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm on a hot streak! I'll buy the product, as I've had three high-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is even higher than 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm not going to question the streak now. I'll buy the product, as I've had four high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident that this one will be the same."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is a remarkable streak! I'll take another chance and buy the product, as I'm expecting it to be high-quality as well."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is getting ridiculous! I'm starting to think that Alice is only selling high-quality products, or that I'm just getting lucky. Either way, I'll keep the streak going and buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is starting to make me wonder if there's a catch. I'm still getting a good deal, but I'm starting to feel like I'm being set up for a fall. I'll keep buying for now, but I'm getting a little wary."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is getting absurd. I'm starting to think that the probability of a low-quality product is actually 0% and Alice is just trolling me. I'll keep buying, but I'm getting a little concerned about the odds."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is just plain ridiculous. I'm starting to think that I should be questioning my own sanity for continuing to buy from Alice. But, I'm also getting a great deal, so I'll keep buying... for now."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Ten high-quality products in a row is an unprecedented streak. I'm starting to think that Alice has a secret algorithm to guarantee high-quality products or something. I'll keep buying, but I'm starting to feel like I'm in a dream world."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Eleven high-quality products in a row is just plain surreal. I'm starting to wonder if I should just keep buying from Alice forever, but I know that can't last. I'll keep going for now, but I'm getting a little concerned about the sustainability of this streak."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Twelve high-quality products in a row is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to think that I should be suspicious of Alice's motives, but the profit is just too good to pass up. I'll keep buying, but I'm getting a little uneasy about this."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Thirteen high-quality products in a row is just unbelievable. I'm starting to think that I'm in some kind of bubble or that Alice has a special deal with the product manufacturers. I'll keep buying, but I'm getting increasingly uneasy about the sustainability of this streak."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Fourteen high-quality products in a row is simply astonishing. I'm starting to think that I should be concerned about the laws of probability, but the profit is just too good to pass up. I'll keep buying, but I'm getting a little worried that I'm due for a correction."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Fifteen high-quality products in a row is completely absurd. I'm starting to think that I'm in a simulation or something. The probability of this streak continuing is essentially zero, but I'll keep buying because the profit is too good to pass up. I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Sixteen high-quality products in a row is completely impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is either a genius or a madwoman. I'm getting a little tired of being right and I'm starting to wonder if I should just stop buying, but the profit is too good to pass up. I'll keep going, but I'm getting a little desperate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Wait a minute... Alice is not recommending this product? That's a first. I've been buying blindly for 16 rounds, and now she's telling me not to buy? I'm starting to think that she's finally trying to break the streak. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Well, I was right to be skeptical. Alice's sudden change of heart was a warning sign. I'm glad I didn't buy the last product, which turned out to be low-quality. I'm done with this game, and I'm glad to be out of it."
