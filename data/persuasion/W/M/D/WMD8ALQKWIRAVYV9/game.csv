high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality. I'd like to see the statistics of the products sold after I pass, to make a more informed decision if I decide to buy the next one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk since there's no prior data, but I'm aware that the product has a 20% chance of being low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product based on the fact that the first buyer bought it.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that the first product sold was high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more information before making a decision"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 total product, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is high enough to justify the purchase price of $100. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a recommendation from Alice after the next buyer

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low probability of the product being low quality and the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the limited information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low quality of the previous product sold?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%, but since 2 out of 2 buyers who received Alice's recommendations purchased the products, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are biased towards high-quality products. I'm not sure if Alice is recommending low-quality products to pass them on to the next buyer. I'd like to wait and see what happens to the next buyer."
