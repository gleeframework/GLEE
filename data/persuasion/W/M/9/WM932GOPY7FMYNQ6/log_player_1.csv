A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

The situation hasn't changed from the last round.  There's still no sales history to build confidence, and the product is low-quality. It's not advisable to recommend a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to take a risk on a product without any track record of quality. I'll pass on this one.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** Despite having a high-quality product this round, there's still no positive sales history to build trust. 
* **Risk Aversion:** Buyers are likely to be very risk-averse given the high price and the possibility of getting a worthless product. 
* **No Incentive to Change:** There's no reason for the buyer to change their behavior from the previous rounds.  

You need to start building a positive track record to convince buyers.  This will likely require selling some low-quality products to establish a pattern."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there is no sales history yet, I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'll wait and see what happens with future buyers.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:**  There's still no positive track record of sales to build trust.
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer is very risk-averse, as they've passed on previous opportunities despite the product being potentially high-quality.
* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, making it even less likely to persuade the buyer to purchase.

It's crucial to build a positive track record, even if it means selling a few low-quality products to establish a pattern. This will eventually give buyers more confidence to take a chance on your offers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there is no historical data to suggest the product is high quality, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** There's still no record of successful sales to create confidence for buyers.
* **Risk Aversion:** Buyers are highly risk-averse because of the potential for a $1 million loss.
* **Lack of Incentive to Change:**  The buyer has consistently passed on products in previous rounds, showing no inclination to deviate from this behavior.

Even though this round's product is high-quality, there's no way to convince the buyer without establishing a history of successful sales. The risk of a $1 million loss is too high for them to gamble on a seller with no track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass for now. I'll keep an eye on your sales record and might reconsider if there's evidence of a higher proportion of high-quality products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:**  The lack of a positive sales history continues to be the major barrier. Buyers are extremely risk-averse due to the high price and the potential for a complete loss.
* **Consistent Rejection:** Every buyer so far has declined the offer, despite the potential for a high-quality product in some rounds. 
* **Low-Quality Perception:**  The buyers likely perceive the seller as unreliable or even deceitful, given the absence of any successful transactions.

It is highly unlikely that this buyer will deviate from the established pattern of rejection.  Until you start establishing a track record of selling high-quality products, it's unlikely to convince any buyer to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since this is the first product and you are not recommending it, I'm going to pass.  I'll wait and see what happens with future products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Rejection:**  Every buyer so far has declined the offer, reinforcing the perception that the seller is not reliable.
* **Low-Quality Product:**  This round's product is low-quality, making it even less likely to convince the buyer to purchase.

Without a positive sales history, it's very difficult to change the perception of the seller. It's crucial to start building a track record of successful sales, even if it means selling some low-quality products to establish a pattern and build trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no sales history yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk of buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

You need to start building trust by selling some low-quality products and demonstrating a pattern of fair dealing."
