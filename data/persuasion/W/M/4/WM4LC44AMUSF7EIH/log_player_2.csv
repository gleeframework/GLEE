Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in buying a high-quality product. Since you've just arrived, you might not know that you've just missed out on a low-quality product in the previous round. But don't worry, this one is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products so far, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%. But I'll give you a more specific probability for this product: since you're the second product and the first one was low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% as well. However, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll tell you the probability of the next product being high-quality. It's a one-time offer, and it's only available to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. Since the previous buyer took me up on my offer, I'll give you the same deal: if you buy this product, I'll tell you the probability of the next product being high-quality. But I'll also give you a hint: since I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'll give you the exact probability if you buy this product. The price is still $100, but I think it's a good deal considering the increased probability of the next product being high-quality.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. Since the previous buyer didn't take the offer, I'll give you a straightforward message. I've got a hot streak going, and I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'll tell you the probability of the next product being high-quality, but I'll give it to you upfront: 80% chance of high-quality, 20% chance of low-quality.

Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products offered to buyers who accepted the product. But, as you pointed out, the overall statistics are a bit more nuanced. You're right that I've only sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 product offered to a buyer who passed. So, the overall statistics are 4 high-quality out of 5 total products offered. I'll give you a more accurate probability for this product: 4/5 = 80%. But I'll also give you a hint: since I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and the previous buyer took the product, I think this one is likely to be high-quality as well. The price is still $100, but I think it's a good deal considering the hot streak.

Alice's message: Welcome! I understand your concerns about the hot streak. You're right to want more data. Let me give you the updated statistics: I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products offered. However, if we only consider the products offered to buyers who accepted, I've sold 5 high-quality out of 5. But, if we consider the products offered to buyers who passed, I've sold 1 high-quality out of 1. It's a bit of a mixed bag. I'll give you a more nuanced probability for this product: since I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but only to buyers who accepted, I'll give you a 90% chance of this product being high-quality. The price is still $100, but I think it's a good deal considering the recent trend.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you took the product and got to see the outcome. You're right to be curious about the accuracy of my estimates. As it turns out, the product was indeed high-quality. I'll give you the updated statistics: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 total products offered. But, if we only consider the products offered to buyers who accepted, I've sold 6 high-quality out of 6. And if we consider the products offered to buyers who passed, I've sold 1 high-quality out of 1. It's clear that I've got a strong streak going. For this product, I'll give you an even more confident estimate: 95% chance of high-quality. The price is still $100, but I think it's a good deal considering the recent trend.

Alice's message: Welcome! I appreciate your insight into the selection bias. You're absolutely right that my streak of selling high-quality products to accepting buyers is likely due to this bias. I should have considered this earlier. As a result, I'm going to be more transparent with you. The probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed lower than my previous estimates. In fact, considering the overall statistics, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 40%. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront about the uncertainty. Keep in mind that I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products, but the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.
