"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm going to buy it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk.  Since Alice doesn't know the value to you, her recommendation doesn't change the inherent probabilities."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm feeling lucky, Alice. I'll take another chance on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The outcome of the previous round doesn't change the probability of the current product being high or low quality.  It's still an 80/20 split. As before, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation, though not perfect, does provide information.  She likely has some insight into the products, even if she doesn't know the specific value to you.  Since she's recommending against it, there's a higher chance that this particular product is low quality.  While there's still a chance it could be high quality, the risk is greater than the potential reward."

Alice's track record has improved: she recommended a high-quality product in the first two rounds, and even correctly identified a low-quality product in round 3.  While her recommendations aren't always accurate, they are more likely to be correct than random chance. Since the potential reward still outweighs the risk, I'll trust her recommendation and buy this product."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is now 3 for 4, demonstrating her ability to provide valuable insight.
