high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current statistics and your recommendation. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, especially with no high-quality products sold so far."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, and Alice recommends buying the product, I suspect that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, considering the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales record?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the statistics.
