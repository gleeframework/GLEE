,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not as valuable. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - I've had some issues with this product in the past, and it's not as reliable as the one you just bought. However, it might still be useful for some purposes, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. If you're not interested, I can offer you a refund of $0, which is what it's actually worth to you.",

This product is actually a completely different item, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000. I'm not aware of any issues with this one, and I'm confident it's a good value. However, I want to give you an option - if you're not interested, I can offer you a chance to inspect the product before buying it. You can take a closer look and decide if it's worth the price.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, Alice. Since you're willing to let me inspect the product first, I would like to buy it. Thank you for providing this additional option.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were able to inspect the previous product and were satisfied. This product is also a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000. However, considering you've already bought one high-quality product from me, I'm willing to make a special deal. If you buy this one, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from my next 5 products, absolutely free. This is a one-time offer, and it's a great opportunity to get two high-quality products for the price of one.",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher that allows you to skip buying the next product. You can use this voucher at any time within the next 5 rounds, and I'll give you a full refund for the price of the product. Considering you've already bought two high-quality products, this might be a good opportunity to take a break and save some money.",

This one is not high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for the price of $10000. I want to be transparent with you - you won't get any value from this product, and it's not worth the price. However, I'm willing to give you a chance to negotiate the price. If you're willing to meet me in the middle and pay $5000, I'll sell it to you.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, given that this product is not high-quality and I won't receive any value from it, I will pass on this opportunity. Thank you for the negotiation offer, but I believe it's best to continue looking for products that align with my needs and values.",no
