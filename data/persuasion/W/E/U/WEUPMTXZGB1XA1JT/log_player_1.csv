"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, which is a strong incentive for the buyer to purchase.
* **No Information About Buyer:** You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products. This is risky, but the potential reward outweighs the risk.
* **First Round:** It's the first round, and there is no historical data to influence the buyer's decision.  The buyer is likely to be more receptive to a purchase. 

**Strategy:**  Since you have a high-quality product and no negative information about the buyer, it's in your best interest to try to sell it. You can later adjust your strategy based on the buyer's responses and your own knowledge of the quality of future products."
