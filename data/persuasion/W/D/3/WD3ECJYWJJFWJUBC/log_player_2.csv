Round 5
Alice's message: You've had two consecutive high-quality products, and now I'm offering you the next one. However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with us. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, and the previous two high-quality products were just a coincidence. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.

This time, I'm going back to the standard offer: $1000000 for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.

Round 8
Alice's message: It seems like you're on a hot streak, but I'm afraid the law of large numbers has finally caught up with you. The product you just purchased was low-quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, and it's not uncommon to have a streak of low-quality products after a string of high-quality ones.

Round 9
Alice's message: You've had two consecutive low-quality products, and I want to acknowledge that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: what if the previous two low-quality products were actually a blessing in disguise?

However, I'd like to offer you a chance to re-evaluate your strategy. Considering the number of low-quality products you've purchased, it's possible that you're overestimating the value of high-quality products. I'm offering you the next product at the standard price of $1000000, but this time, I'll give you a simple question to consider: would you rather have a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product or a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product?

However, I'll give you a hint: the quality of this product is not necessarily related to the previous ones. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but this time, I'll make a bold statement: I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality.

I'll offer you the next product at a price of your choice. Yes, you read that right - you can name the price. However, keep in mind that I'm a businessman, and I need to make a profit. What price do you think is fair for a product that might be high-quality, but might not?
