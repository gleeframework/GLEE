As Alice, I should continue recommending the product.  Here's why:

* **High Probability of Quality:** Even though I don't know the buyer's specific valuation, the 80% probability of a high-quality product is very strong.
* **Strong Sales Record:**  The buyer has observed a very high success rate (likely around 90% or higher). This record reinforces the trust in the product's quality.
* **No Loss for the Buyer:**  If the buyer doesn't buy, they lose nothing.  If they buy a high-quality product, they benefit.  This is a low-risk proposition for the buyer. 
* **Maintaining Reputation:**  Continuing to recommend high-quality products is essential for building a good reputation and attracting more buyers in the future."
