}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'd like to think critically about the statistics. With only 3 sales and 3 high-quality products, the sample size is still relatively small.

}"

After the last sale, the statistics are now: 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which means the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. However, I'd like to highlight that the last two products had a different outcome, which might suggest that the probability is not as consistent as it seemed before.
