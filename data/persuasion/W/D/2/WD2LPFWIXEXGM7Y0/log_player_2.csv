The price remains the same, $100. With the odds now in our favor, I think this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount... compared to its true value of $200.

I think it's safe to say that the high-quality products are not as common as I initially thought. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 2:5, or 2/5. I'm not making any promises, but I think it's getting less likely that this one is high-quality. The price is still $100. What's your decision?

I think it's time to be honest with you - the odds are not in your favor. However, I've got a great deal for you! This one is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's a steal at twice the price, considering its true value is $200. What do you say?

Alice's message: Welcome to our eighth product! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 8 so far, which means the last three were low-quality products. I think it's safe to say that the law of averages is catching up to me, and high-quality products are not as common as I'd like. I'm not making any promises, but I think it's getting increasingly unlikely that this one is high-quality. The price is still $100. It's a long shot, but what do you think?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right, 3 high-quality products out of 8 is still a relatively small sample size. But I'll give you a more nuanced view: out of the last 4 products, 3 were low-quality. That's a 75% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - the odds are against you. The price is still $100. If you're feeling lucky, I won't judge.
