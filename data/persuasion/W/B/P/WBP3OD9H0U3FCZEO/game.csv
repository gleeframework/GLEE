,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the recommendation based on the previous buyer's purchase, which was a high-quality product. With only one data point, I'm not sure if the previous buyer was just lucky or if the product is indeed high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can take advantage of the low price and the fact that I'm the second buyer."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the low-quality product, but I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for it. I'm willing to take the risk and pay for it, but I'm also curious about Alice's reasoning for not recommending it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but given that only 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 6, I'm going to take a chance. My reasoning is that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33% because some of the previous buyers may have passed on high-quality products, and I'm the 7th buyer, so I might get a higher-quality product than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
