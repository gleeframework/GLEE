"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, and Alice knows the quality, her recommendation is valuable information. Even though there's still a chance it's low quality, the potential gain of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 cost) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information.  Since she knows the quality and is not recommending the product, it's likely the product is low quality.
