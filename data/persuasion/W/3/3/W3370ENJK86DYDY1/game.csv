low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is neutral, so I'll just have to trust my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I will pass on this product to see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of data. I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, and I'm hoping that this product might be the first high-quality one. I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold so far were low quality, which is a strong indication that the remaining products are likely to be low quality as well. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low quality. This increases my suspicion that the product you are recommending to me might also be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the quality of the product after I make the purchase. I'd like to make a decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, not just your recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5 products, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the low-quality product ratio is too high based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the outcome. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on this product. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, and I'm the 8th buyer, which means there's still a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, is it because you think it's a low-quality product or is it because the probability of it being high-quality is too low?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 8 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator that it's likely to be low-quality, and I'm trying to break the streak of 0 high-quality products sold. I'm hoping to be the one to prove you wrong, Alice!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
