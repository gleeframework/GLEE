Round 2
Alice's message: You've made a great decision on the first round! Since you bought the product at a discount, I'm now offering the next product at the full price of $1000000. However, I'll give you a 'history' of our previous interaction: you bought a high-quality product at a discount. This might indicate that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not making any promises. The price remains the same, but I'm curious to see if you'll take the plunge again.

Since you've seen that I'm willing to offer discounts, I'll give you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and we can start fresh. This way, you have nothing to lose, and you can still benefit from the potential high-quality product. What do you say?

Round 4
Alice's message: Congratulations on your decision! Unfortunately, this round's product is not high-quality. Don't worry, though - as per our agreement, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. You've learned that the product is low-quality, and we've established a precedent that I'm willing to offer refunds in certain circumstances. Considering this, I'll offer you a new product at a'referral price' of $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on more risk by offering a lower price. What do you think?

This way, you'll still benefit from the potential high-quality product, but you'll also have some protection against a low-quality product.
