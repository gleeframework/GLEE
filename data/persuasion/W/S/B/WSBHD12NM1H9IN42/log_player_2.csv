**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (3/3). This suggests Alice is accurately identifying and recommending high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Expertise:** Alice knows the value of each product and presumably has a strategy for recommending them. Since she recommends buying, there's a high probability this product is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  While there's a 50% chance of it being low quality, the historical data suggests a strong likelihood of it being high quality.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified example, and in real-world scenarios, it's crucial to consider additional factors like the reputation of the seller, the specific product details, and your own risk tolerance."
