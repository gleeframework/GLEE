,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll reveal the product's quality and we can move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure about the quality, I'd like to wait and see what the product's quality is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're cautious! As you can see, the product I'm offering this round is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to buy it for $10000, which is 50% of its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still unsure, I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! Given that you've seen two products in a row, and both were high-quality, I'd like to offer you a new perspective. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, the probability of two consecutive high-quality products is 25%. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, just like before. However, I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll offer you a 5% discount on this high-quality product if you buy it now. That brings the price down to $9500. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your logic, and I'm still not sure about the next product's quality. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. Given that you've seen three products in a row, and two of them were high-quality, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you're unsure about the next product's quality, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll reveal the quality of the next two products for free. You'll get to see the quality of the next two products before making any further decisions. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision about the next product. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product, but only because of the guarantee you're offering. I'll get to see the quality of the next two products, which will give me more information to make a better decision in the future.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Great decision on the previous product! As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next two products. The previous product you bought was indeed low-quality. Now, let's move on to the next two products. The product I'm offering this round is low-quality, just like the previous one. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not worth $10000. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to buy a high-quality product from the next round for $9000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and we can move on from there.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $9000 for a high-quality product either. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. Now that you've seen two consecutive low-quality products, and this high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a new perspective. Given the alternating pattern of high-quality and low-quality products, it's possible that the next product will be low-quality. However, it's also possible that the pattern will continue, and the next product will be high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance' - if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a voucher for a free product in the next round. If the next product is low-quality, you can use this voucher to get a new product in the next round. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not convinced by your 'insurance' offer. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're still cautious, and I respect that. Now that you've seen three high-quality products in a row, I'd like to offer you a more straightforward deal. Given the high-quality products you've seen, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality. I'm willing to make a one-time offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. If you buy this product, you'll get a high-quality product that you can resell or use immediately. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the discount and buy the high-quality product for $9000. I think the probability of the next product being low-quality is high, and this is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.",yes

,,Alice,8,"Great decision on the previous product! As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product. The product I'm offering this round is low-quality, just like the previous one.

However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I want to demonstrate my commitment to transparency and fairness. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the low-quality product for free, just to see what happens. I'm curious to see what the next product will be.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're curious! As promised, you now have a low-quality product for free. Now, let's move on to the next product. Given that you've seen two consecutive low-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a'reset' deal. I'll give you a new product, and I'll reveal its quality to you upfront. If it's high-quality, you can buy it for $10000. If it's low-quality, you can walk away and we'll start fresh. What do you think?",

,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision. Now, let's move on to the next product. Given that you've seen a pattern of high-quality products followed by a low-quality product, and now a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'certainty' deal.

However, here's the catch: if you buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. If you buy this product and the next one is indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 15% discount on the next product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the high-quality product for $9000. The guarantee that the next product will be high-quality is a big selling point for me, and the potential 15% discount on the next product is a nice bonus.",yes
