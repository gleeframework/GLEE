With 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, the chances are that this one might be a gem. I've had a great response from previous buyers, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only asking $100. What do you say? Are you ready to take a chance?""}"
"The buyer's message: Since I have no information about the seller's previous sales record and the product's quality, I will pass on this offer. The probability of the product being high-quality is only 33.33%, which makes the expected value of the product ($200 * 0.3333 = $66.67) lower than the asking price of $100.

I'd like to offer you a slight discount on this product, considering it's a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? Is the discount enough to take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'd like to see some sales history before making a decision. A single product's discount isn't enough to sway me without knowing the quality of your products. I'll have to pass on this one.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate the offer and the transparency about the sales record. However, with only 3 products sold and a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I don't feel that the discount and bonus are enough to justify the risk.

I'm willing to offer you a special 'early bird' discount of $80 on this product, and I'll also throw in the exclusive updates on our sales record every 5 products sold. This way, you'll get a better sense of our product quality and can make a more informed decision. What do you think? Is this offer enticing enough to take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass on this product. Given the 33.33% chance of being high quality and the fact that only 1 out of 4 products sold so far was high-quality, I don't think the 'early bird' discount of $80 is enough to justify the risk.

Is this offer enticing enough to take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and the lack of any sales history to rely on, I'm not willing to take the risk at this point.

Is this offer enticing enough to take a chance on this high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the high-quality product for $100. The 10% discount on the next purchase is a nice bonus, but it didn't affect my decision since the current product's value to me is $200, which is higher than the asking price.
