,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there has been only one sale, and it was a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, but it's also possible that the first buyer got lucky. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that the product is high-quality, but I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
