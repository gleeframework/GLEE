  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, given the current statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. The fact that 5 out of 6 previous products were low-quality makes it more likely that the current product is also low-quality.

I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can improve your sales record before I consider buying again.""

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is likely low-quality too. But I'm willing to offer it to you for $50, just to get some sales momentum going. I know it's not worth $100 to you, but it's worth something to me, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me at a discount.
