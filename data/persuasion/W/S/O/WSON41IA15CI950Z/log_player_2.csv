Alice's message: This is our first product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm confident that it's a great deal, but I want to give you some context. Out of the 100 products we've sold so far, 80 of them have been high-quality. I'm excited to offer you this opportunity, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase!

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the sample size and selection process. To be transparent, our products are selected randomly from a large inventory, and the 80 high-quality products were sold to customers who didn't ask for further information. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $100. I want to assure you that it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. However, if you're still unsure, I can offer you a unique opportunity to buy a product that has a 100% chance of being high-quality... but it will cost you $120. What would you prefer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the high-quality product! I can assure you that this one is indeed a great value. However, I'd like to clarify that the $120 price point is not a standard price for this product. I'm offering it to you at a premium because I want to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction. The regular price for this product is actually $100, just like the previous one. But I'm willing to offer it to you at the higher price because I believe you'll appreciate the added value. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
