,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't want to buy a product without any information about its quality, especially since the previous buyer also passed on it. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the odds are against me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products were all low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making the expected value of the product lower than $1000000. I'd like to pass and see if the product is discarded or if someone else buys it."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. I'd like to see more information about the products sold so far.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is of higher quality."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it, which might indicate a higher chance of it being low quality. I'll take the chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality. I'd like to know the current proportion of low-quality products sold, which is 4/4 = 1. This is significantly higher than the expected 2/3. Based on this information, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
