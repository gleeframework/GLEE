Now, I'm offering you this high-quality item for $1000000. You can buy it now, or you can wait and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk. Keep in mind that the odds are still 33.33% in my favor, but the next buyer might be willing to take the risk and get a low-quality item for $1000000.",

The last two buyers were cautious and didn't buy, and now I'm offering you this low-quality item for $1000000. I'll be honest with you, I've been selling a lot of high-quality items recently, and I'm starting to think that the next one might be a low-quality item too. Would you like to take the risk and buy this one, or would you rather wait and see if I have a high-quality item next?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd rather wait and see if you have a high-quality item next. Your recent sales record shows that 4 out of 4 high-quality products were sold, which is an unusually high proportion.

The last two buyers were cautious and didn't buy, and now I'm offering you this low-quality item for $1000000. I think you're right to be skeptical - I have to admit, my recent sales record has been unusually good, and it's possible that I've been selling a lot of high-quality items in a row. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this item is likely low-quality. But hey, you might get lucky and it could be a good deal! What do you say?",

You'll get a clear idea of what you're getting yourself into, and you can make an informed decision. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the offer, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not just buying the product because of the special deal.

I think I've been clear about the quality of my products, and I'm willing to make a final offer: I'll sell you this low-quality item for $500000. That's right, I'm willing to cut the price in half.
