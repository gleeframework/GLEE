"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. It's a rare opportunity to get a top-notch item at a fair price. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy it, I'll throw in a free inspection report that details its features and benefits. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to provide this kind of value with any other product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for more information. Let me be transparent with you: I have a product that's not one of my best. It's still a good product, but it's not as high-quality as the ones I showed you earlier. I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a'scratch-and-dent' deal. It's a great opportunity to get a good product at a discounted price, but it's not the top-of-the-line item I showed you earlier. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a'scratch-and-dent' deal. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price or a low-quality product at a lower price. I'm not sure what the quality of this product is, and I don't want to overpay for something that might be mediocre.""

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll love the extra value you'll get with this premium version.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the premium version. You're still not giving me any information about the quality of the product, and I'm not willing to pay $90 for something that might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that's clearly high-quality at the regular price.""
