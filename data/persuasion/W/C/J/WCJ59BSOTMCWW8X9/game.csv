high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior data to inform my decision and I'm not influenced by Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, which might have been a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low-quality is high, given your previous recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for a low price."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were able to find a high-quality product, I'm going to take a risk and pass. I'm hoping that the next product might be high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 buyers have already passed on the products, which suggests that the probability of the product being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm worried that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm assuming that if you didn't recommend it, it's probably low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me since it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, it suggests that the products offered to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'd also like to ask if you can provide more information about the previous sales. Specifically, can you tell me how many high-quality products were sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is still 80%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have purchased and 0 high-quality products have been sold.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
