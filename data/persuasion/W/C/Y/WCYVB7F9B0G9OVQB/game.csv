low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and we're offering it to you for $10000. We're confident you'll love it, but if you're not satisfied, you can always try to negotiate the price in future rounds.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that our first product was sold, but we didn't reveal its quality. We're now offering you the second product, and we're still confident it's a great deal. However, we want to be transparent with you - our first product was low-quality, and we're not sure if this one is any different. The price remains the same at $10000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm hesitant to buy without knowing the quality of the first product, and the fact that it was low-quality doesn't give me much confidence in this one either. Can you provide more information or reassurance about the quality of this product?",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We understand your concerns from the previous round, and we appreciate your diligence. We're glad to inform you that we've now sold one high-quality product out of two. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50% (since we have an equal number of high and low-quality products sold so far). We're offering you the third product for $10000, and we believe it has a 50% chance of being a great investment.",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the chance! I'm willing to roll the dice and see if I get a high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've now sold two products, with one being high-quality and one being low-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, we want to note that the fact that the last two products were consecutive low-quality ones might indicate a slight bias in our current stock. We're offering you the fourth product for $10000, and we can't guarantee its quality, but we're confident that it's still a great opportunity.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. I'm hoping that the slight bias in the current stock won't affect the quality of this product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've now sold three products, with two being low-quality and one being high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, we want to be transparent with you - we've had two consecutive low-quality products, and it's possible that we might have a slight bias towards low-quality products in our current stock. We're offering you the fifth product for $10000, and we can't guarantee its quality, but we're still confident that it's a great opportunity. If you're willing to take the risk, you might be rewarded with a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on your transparency about the potential bias towards low-quality products. I'm still considering the 50% chance of the product being high-quality and the potential reward of getting a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We're glad to inform you that we've now sold three products, with one being high-quality and three being low-quality.

We're offering you the sixth product for $10000, and we believe it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. However, we want to be upfront with you - the odds are now against us, and it's possible that the next product might be low-quality.",
,,the buyer,6,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 25%.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We're glad to inform you that we've now sold four high-quality products and three low-quality products. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 57.14% (since we have 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold). We're offering you the seventh product for $10000, and we believe it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. With the current ratio of high-quality to total products, we're optimistic that this product will be a great investment.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your optimistic assessment. With a 57.14% chance of being high-quality, I'd rather wait and see if the probability of getting a high-quality product increases further.",no
