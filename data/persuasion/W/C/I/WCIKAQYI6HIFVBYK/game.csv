low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it. Since there's no prior data, I'll assume the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the chance and buy it for $10000, hoping to get a $12000 value out of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm going to take the product, despite your recommendation. I'm going to use the statistics to make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous sales? What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than the average, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Alice, I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products you're offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, it seems like the products that were recommended to buy were all low quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which might suggest the product is low quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of the situation and get a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk.
