,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000! It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still very useful, even if it's not the best quality. Think about all the money you'll save by buying from me instead of waiting for a high-quality product. Plus, I'm confident that you'll be able to find a way to make this product work for you. What do you say? Will you take the deal?",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product, Bob! However, I want to approach this next product with a different strategy.

If you're not satisfied with its performance, you can return it and get a full refund. I'm willing to take on the risk myself, because I believe that this product has the potential to surprise you. The price remains the same at $10000, and I'll throw in the premium service package and personalized consultation as before. What do you think? Is this a chance to take a calculated risk and potentially discover a hidden gem?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the creative offer, but I notice that you still haven't mentioned the quality of the current product. As before, I'm not willing to make a purchase without knowing the specific quality of the product. The 'test drive' offer sounds interesting, but it's not enough to convince me to take a chance on a product of unknown quality.
