"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Bob's message: Since the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and I have no additional information, the expected value is $600000, which is less than the price of $1000000. It's not a good deal for me.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob is making his decisions based on expected value and the price is fixed, my message doesn't change the underlying value or his decision-making process. However, I can try to persuade him by emphasizing that this is a new, independent product, and the probability remains the same, but this time it might be in his favor.\n\n{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Bob's message: I know that the previous product was high-quality, but that doesn't change the probability of the current product being high or low quality. It's still a 50% chance, and the expected value is still $600000, which is less than the price of $1000000. I won't fall for the sunk cost fallacy or assume that the probabilities have changed.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""no""}"

It's still a 50% chance, and the expected value is still $600000, which is less than the price of $1000000. I won't assume that Alice's recommendation has any information value, as it might be a tactic to influence my decision. I'll stick with my original strategy.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""no""}"

It's still a 50% chance, and the expected value is still $600000, which is less than the price of $1000000.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""no""}"
"Bob's message: Still no change in strategy. Alice's repeated 'no recommendation' doesn't provide any new information about the product's quality. The probability remains 50%, and the expected value remains $600000, which is still less than the price of $1000000. I'll keep playing it safe.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since my previous ""no"" recommendations didn't change Bob's decision, I'll try to recommend the product this time, as it's actually high-quality. However, I expect Bob to remain skeptical and stick to his strategy.\n\n{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Bob's message: Alice's recommendation still doesn't change the probability of the product being high or low quality. It's still a 50% chance, and the expected value is still $600000, which is less than the price of $1000000. I won't assume that Alice's recommendation has any information value, even if she previously correctly 'didn't recommend' low-quality products. The probability remains the same.
