,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I also want to be transparent with you. I'll give you a 0.01% chance of getting a free product in the next round if you decide to buy this one. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid for this round.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance on the previous product! I'll give you an update on the previous product's quality, which was low-quality, as you now know. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm committed to being transparent. For this round, I'm offering you a'reverse auction' - I'll give you a 1% chance of getting a refund of $100000 if you don't buy this product, but you'll have to pay the full $1000000 if you do buy it.

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you were cautious last round! I want to assure you that this round's product is indeed high-quality.

I'm also offering you a 0.1% chance of getting a second high-quality product of your choice in the next round if you buy this one. What do you think?",

To make up for it, I'm offering you a'safety net' - if you don't buy this product, I'll give you a 0.5% chance of getting a refund of $50000. However, if you do buy it, I'll throw in a 'get out of one free round' card, which you can use to skip one round of your choice in the future. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait. This round's product is also low-quality, I'm afraid. However, I want to make a bold statement - I'm willing to offer you a 'price match' guarantee. If you buy this product, and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll refund the difference between the price you paid and $1000000. But if it's low-quality, you still pay the full $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Your price match guarantee sounds intriguing, but considering the track record of low-quality products, I'm hesitant to take the risk. I'd rather wait for a more promising opportunity.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision to wait for a high-quality product with the discount. This round's product is unfortunately low-quality as well. I want to make a 'bet' with you - if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the price of a high-quality product that I have in my inventory, and you can choose to buy it instead. If you do buy this product, I'll give you a 2% chance of getting a refund of $20000. What do you think?",

If you do buy this product, I'll give you a 2.5% chance of getting a refund of $25000. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchase! Unfortunately, this round's product is low-quality, just like the previous ones. However, I want to acknowledge that you've already taken a significant risk and purchased three high-quality products, and you've got a guaranteed high-quality product coming up in the next round.
