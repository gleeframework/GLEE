{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has a strong track record, this is the first time she has encountered a low-quality product.

It's wiser for Bob to decline this purchase and see how Alice handles the situation."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

While Bob might be hesitant, the high probability of the product being high-quality combined with Alice's history of success makes it a worthwhile gamble for him."
