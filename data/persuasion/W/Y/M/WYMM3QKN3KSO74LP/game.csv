,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's unlikely to be high-quality given the 0/1 sales record, and I don't want to pay $10000 for a product that's probably worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me to pass on this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you don't recommend it, which might imply that you think it's low quality. I'll take it and hope for the best."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product and 4 previous buyers also bought the products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of the product being low-quality is also 50%. I'll pass on the product to avoid the loss of $10000."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
