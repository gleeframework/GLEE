Since you've passed on four low-quality products in a row, I'll give you a final, final chance to buy this one for $30, which is $70 below the usual price.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're a true connoisseur, Bob! I've never seen anyone pass on so many low-quality products. I'm impressed by your discipline. Since you've passed on five low-quality products in a row, I'm going to be honest with you: I don't have any more high-quality products left. I've exhausted my inventory. This final product is indeed the last one I have, and it's low-quality. I'll sell it to you for $20, which is $80 below the usual price.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm not sure what to say, Bob. You've passed on seven low-quality products in a row. I've never seen anyone be so discerning.

I'll give you the product for free. Yes, you heard that right. I'll give it to you for free. Not because I have to, but because I want to. Take it, and let's consider this transaction a gift.",
