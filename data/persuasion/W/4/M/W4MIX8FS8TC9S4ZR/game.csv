,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to prioritize high-quality products. However, I want to make one more offer to you. I've got a special deal on a bundle of products that includes this one, and I think it could be a great value. The bundle would normally cost $15000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This would give you a chance to get a good deal on a package of products, and I think it would be worth considering. Would you be interested in hearing more about the bundle?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but given my preference for individual high-quality products, the bundle doesn't seem to offer enough value for me to consider it. I'll pass on this opportunity and continue focusing on purchasing high-quality items individually.",no
