I'd like to assure you that this product is just as valuable as the last one I offered. In fact, I'm so confident in its quality that I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll offer you a second product at the same price.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about my sales record, and I appreciate your skepticism. Let me put it this way: I've sold 1 high-quality product to another buyer, and 1 low-quality product to a previous buyer. I'm now offering a new product to you for $10000. I'd like to point out that the fact that I've sold at least one high-quality product suggests that my overall product quality is likely to be good. Furthermore, I'm willing to offer you a 50/50 chance of getting a refund if this product turns out to be low-quality. What do you say?
