Let me clarify: I don't have any control over the quality of the products, and I'm not selecting which products to show you. The quality of each product is determined randomly. I'm simply reporting the facts as I know them. We have 16 high-quality products left out of a total of 12 products. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.
