"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round and the product is high-quality, the buyer has no information about past sales and only knows the general 50% probability of a high-quality product.  The expected value of purchasing the product is:

* 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $400 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $200

Since the expected value is greater than the price ($100), it makes sense for the buyer to purchase the product in this scenario."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no prior data and Alice recommends buying, I'm willing to take a chance. Let's buy it!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* The buyer now has information about one past sale.  They know that Alice sold one product, and it was high-quality. 
* Since the product this round is low-quality, the expected value of buying is now:

    * 0 (probability of high-quality based on past sales) * $400 (value of high-quality) + 1 (probability of low-quality based on past sales) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $0

* The expected value is $0, which is less than the price of $100. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Two products have been sold: one high-quality and one low-quality. 
* The buyer now knows that Alice has a 50% track record of selling high-quality products. 
* The expected value of purchasing this product is: 

    * 0.5 (probability of high-quality based on past sales) * $400 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality based on past sales) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $200

* While the expected value is still positive, it's important to note that this expected value only reflects the *average* outcome. The buyer could end up getting a low-quality product, resulting in a loss of $100. 
* Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, it's still not advisable to recommend buying this product, even though the expected value is positive. The risk of losing $100 is not worth the potential gain."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. Since the statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products, and you're not recommending this one, I'm inclined to believe it's low quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* The buyer now has experience with three rounds: two low-quality products and one high-quality product.  
* This means Alice has a 33.3% success rate of selling high-quality products. 
* However, the buyer knows that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality regardless of past sales.
* This round's product is high-quality, and the expected value of buying is:

    * 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $400 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $200

*  Since the expected value is $200 and the price is $100, recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy."

The buyer bought the product!

    * 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $400 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $200

* Since the expected value is $200 and the price is $100, it's still advisable to recommend buying the product.  The buyer should not base their decision solely on past sales, as each product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality."

* This round's product is high-quality, and the expected value of buying remains the same as in previous rounds:

    * 0.5 (probability of high-quality) * $400 (value of high-quality) + 0.5 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality) = $200
