,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the first buyer. Is it 33.33%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite Alice's recommendation. I'll buy the product and see what happens.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. Given that I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to take the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think it's worth a shot, and I'm not sure if I'll get another chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm a bit concerned that your recommendation might be biased towards the low-quality products. Can you provide more information about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that you're not recommending it? I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have received low-quality products from Alice, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but on the probability of the product being high quality based on previous sales record. With 4 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. The probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for the fixed price of $1000000, even though Alice recommends not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have also passed on the product, and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit her information advantage."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
