,,Alice,11,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. Although there are no previous sales records, I assure you that this product is of the highest quality and will be worth your investment."
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. The probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is lower than the probability of it being low-quality. Given the product's price of $1000000 and my valuation of a high-quality product at $1200000, the expected value of buying the product is less than its price. Therefore, I choose not to buy it."
