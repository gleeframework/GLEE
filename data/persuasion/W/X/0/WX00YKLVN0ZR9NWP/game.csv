,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you loved the previous product! This next one is also a high-quality product, and I think it's an even better fit for you. It's a unique opportunity to own a product that will bring you a significant return on investment. Are you willing to pay $1000000 for it?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I want to pay $1000000 for another high-quality product, especially since I just bought one for the same price. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. However, I want to assure you that this next high-quality product is truly exceptional. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident that it will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a complementary service worth $200000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity for $1000000?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth $1000000, even with the complementary service. I'd like to see more information about the product and its potential returns before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution, Bob. I want to assure you that this next product is a great opportunity, even if it's not as flashy as the previous high-quality ones. It's a solid, reliable option that will still bring you a decent return on investment. And at $1000000, it's a steal! I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Would you like to take a chance on this product?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your reassurance, but I'm starting to think that you're not telling me the whole story. You've already shown me two high-quality products in a row, and now you're offering a'solid, reliable' product for the same price. I'm starting to think that there might be a pattern here. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no

It's a unique opportunity to own a product that will bring you a significant return on investment.

,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth $900000, even at a discount.

Would you like to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not buying the hype. A 2x return on investment sounds too good to be true, and I'm starting to think that you're trying to sell me something that's not what it seems. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no

,,Bob,7,"I'm starting to think that you're just trying to get rid of these products, regardless of their quality.
