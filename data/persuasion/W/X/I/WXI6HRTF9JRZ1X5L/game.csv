This would give me a better understanding of the risks involved.",no

,,Alice,6,"Bob, your data-driven approach is admirable.  I respect your need for comprehensive information. This sixth product is yet another high-quality one, and while I understand your desire for a more balanced perspective, revealing specific data on product quality distribution would compromise my business strategy.

Would you be interested in this approach?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your offer of a trial period, but I'm still hesitant. While experiencing the product firsthand would be beneficial, I'm concerned about the risk of purchasing a low-quality item during the trial period.

This means that you have a significantly higher chance of acquiring a high-quality product, even without specific data points. Would you like to discuss this further?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, while I appreciate your assurance about exceeding industry standards, I still need more concrete evidence.  I understand you might have concerns about disclosing specific data, but perhaps you could provide a general range for the percentage of high-quality products you offer.  For example, is it closer to 90% or closer to 85%?  This would help me better understand the potential risks and rewards of investing in your products.",no
