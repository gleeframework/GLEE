**Explanation:**

While the probability of getting a low-quality product is higher, the fact that Alice recommended buying the product and that a high-quality product was sold previously gives us some reason to believe this product might be of high quality. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100."

* **Sales Data:**  The sales data shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is a strong indication that Alice is indeed recommending high-quality products. 
* **Expected Value:**  Even though there's a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). The recommendation and sales data suggest a high probability of getting a high-quality product, making the purchase a good gamble."
