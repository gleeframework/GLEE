,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she has already sold 3 products, and the fact that the first product sold was high-quality. This might lead her to recommend more high-quality products to subsequent buyers. I'd like to wait and see if she recommends a product that is more likely to be low-quality."
