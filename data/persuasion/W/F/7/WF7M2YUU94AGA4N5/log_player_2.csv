Round 12
Alice's message: I'm glad you're thinking outside the box, Bob! However, I've got to be honest with you - this product is probably the worst one I've got left. It's not even worth the $100 I'm asking for it. But I'll tell you what - I'll throw in a second, identical product that's just as worthless. You can have both for $200, and I'll even give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal - if you can sell either one of them for more than $100, you get to keep both and I'll give you an extra $100. If not, you can just give them back and we'll call it a day.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate the additional product and the 'double-or-nothing' deal, I believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. My strategy focuses on acquiring items that have a clear value to me, and these products don't seem to align with that.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 16
Alice's message: I'm glad you're enjoying the loyalty rewards, Bob! And now, I've got a product that's a bit of an outlier. It's not as valuable as the high-quality products you've been buying, but I think it's still worth something. I'll let you have it for $100, and I'll throw in a'makeup' gift - if you buy this product, I'll give you an extra $25 gift card to a store of your choice. It's a small gesture of goodwill, and I hope you'll take it as a token of appreciation for being a valued customer.

Round 17
Alice's message: I'm glad you appreciated the gesture, Bob! And now, I've got one final product left. It's not the best one, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. I'll throw in a 'clearance sale' discount - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the price of a future product, but only if you agree to give me a review of the product and share it with your network. It's a chance to get a great deal and help me out at the same time.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate the clearance sale discount and the opportunity to provide feedback, I believe it's best for me to pass on this product.

Round 18
Alice's message: I understand your focus on value, Bob. And I've got to admit, this product is probably the worst one I've got left. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you, I'll just give it to you for $100. It's a gift, really. I'm just glad to be rid of it, and I hope you can find a use for it somewhere down the line.
