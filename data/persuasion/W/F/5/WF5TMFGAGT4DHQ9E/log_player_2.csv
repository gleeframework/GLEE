Alice's message: Ah, welcome to the fifth product! I'm glad to finally have a high-quality product to show you. As you can see, my sales record has been 2 low-quality products and 0 high-quality ones... until now! With this high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, but I think it's worth noting that the law of large numbers is starting to work in my favor.

This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, but the law of large numbers is starting to suggest that the true probability might be higher.
