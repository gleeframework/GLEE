high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'll pass."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data, and also, can you explain why you don't recommend buying it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you're advising me to pass on this product? Is there any information that led you to this decision? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. This increases the likelihood that the current product is also low-quality, making the potential reward of $40000 less likely. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product that has not been recommended by you."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the statistics, though. Is it possible that the lack of high-quality products sold is just due to chance, or is there some other factor at play?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product, I'm inclined to believe that all the previous products were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product, given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision."

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm trying to test Alice's recommendation.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
