**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold. This strongly suggests that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy, given her knowledge of the product's quality, adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product offers a significant profit ($400 - $100 = $300). The risk of a low-quality product is small, as the success rate so far is perfect. 

While there's always a risk, the available information strongly points towards a high-quality product, making the purchase a worthwhile gamble."
