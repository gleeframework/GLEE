This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is low-quality and you cannot offer discounts, there's no reason to recommend Bob to buy it.  Bob values high-quality products more, and you have no way to signal the quality to him.  Recommending a low-quality product at full price would likely result in Bob declining the offer."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
