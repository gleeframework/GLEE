"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

The expected value is greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good deal for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the fundamental probabilities of the products. This round's product is still high-quality, and the expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

The expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), so it's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob's message: I'll take another chance on your recommendation.  I'll buy it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the underlying probabilities. This round's product is still high-quality, and the expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

The expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), so it's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob's message: Three in a row! I'm feeling lucky. I'll buy it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the previous three rounds resulted in high-quality products, the probability of getting a high-quality product remains at 50%.  This round, the product is low-quality. Therefore, the expected value of buying is:

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

However, the expected value is only realized if the product is high-quality. Since the product is low-quality, Bob would lose $10,000.  Therefore, it's not a good deal for Bob to buy this product."
"Bob's message: I appreciate you looking out for me, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Your recommendations have been spot-on so far, so I'll trust your judgment.
Bob didn't bought the product.

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

The expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), so it's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob's message: You've been right every time you've recommended a product, so I'm going to trust you again. I'll take it!

(0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000

The expected value ($20,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), so it's still a good deal for Bob."
