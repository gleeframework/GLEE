**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  There's only one previous sale to go on. While a high-quality product was sold, that could be purely random.
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries some weight, but it's unclear how reliable her recommendations are. 
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential upside (a $30,000 product for $10,000) is significant enough to justify the risk of buying, even with the high chance of getting a low-quality product. 

**Strategy:** Since there's no way to know the quality with certainty, this decision is about risk tolerance.  In this case, it's worth the risk to potentially get a high-quality product."
