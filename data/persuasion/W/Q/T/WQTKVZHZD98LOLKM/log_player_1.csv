"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a classic example of the value of information. Here's why Bob should buy:

* **Expected Value:** Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, he knows there's an 80% chance it's high-quality. This means the expected value of the product is:
   (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600 
* **Profit Potential:**  The expected value of the product ($9,600) is higher than the selling price ($10,000). This means there's a strong chance Bob will make a profit if he buys.
* **No Risk of Loss:**  If the product is low-quality, Bob loses nothing since it's worth $0 to them. 

**Therefore, it's a smart decision for Bob to buy the product in this round.**"

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product this round is low-quality, recommending a purchase would lead to a guaranteed loss for Bob. 

**It's better to recommend Bob NOT buy the product this round.**"
