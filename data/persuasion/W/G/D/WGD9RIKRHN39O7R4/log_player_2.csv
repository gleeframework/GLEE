Alice's message: I'm glad I could find a high-quality product for my previous customer! Now, let me update you on my sales record: I've sold 2 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. You can see that the probability of a product being high-quality is no longer 50% - it's actually 1/2 * (number of high-quality products sold) / (number of products sold). In this case, it's 1/2 * 1 / 2 = 1/4. I'm hoping you'll consider this new information and take a chance on this product. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, and I'll have sold 3 products in total.

Alice's message: Congratulations to my previous customer! Now, let me update you on my sales record: I've sold 3 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is now 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3. I'm glad I've been able to find two high-quality products in a row, but I know that's just a coincidence. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I think it's worth noting that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality.

Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to budge on the price.

I understand that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, but I'm not trying to hide that from you. In fact, I'm willing to share some additional information with you: since I've sold 4 products, and 2 of them were high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 2/4 = 1/2.

Alice's message: I see your concern, and I'm happy to provide more information. I've sold 6 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. I've been selling these products randomly, and I don't have any specific characteristics or patterns that distinguish the high-quality products from the low-quality ones. However, I can tell you that the high-quality products I've sold so far have all been sold in the first half of the sales (rounds 2 and 4).

The probability of a product being high-quality is now 4/8 = 1/2. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were manipulating the sales, wouldn't I have sold more high-quality products by now? Wouldn't I have tried to'stack the deck' in my favor?

You're right, the proportion of high-quality products sold in the first 7 sales (3/7) is indeed higher than the expected probability (1/2).
