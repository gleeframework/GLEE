low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty. This product is not one of the high-quality ones, but I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the high-quality ones. Is this a fair deal?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product that is worth $0 to me. I'm looking forward to the next round and hopefully a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're looking forward to the next round! As promised, I have a high-quality product for you to consider. I want to assure you that this product is one of the best in my inventory, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100, the same price as the low-quality product from the previous round. Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your assurance about the product's quality. Since it's a high-quality product, it's worth $125 to me, which is more than the price you're asking. I think this is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price, so I'm willing to buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase! For this high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a special deal. Since you've already experienced the value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to give you a 10% discount on this one. That brings the price down to $90. Is this a good opportunity to get another high-quality product at a great price?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the discount offer. A high-quality product is worth $125 to me, and with the 10% discount, the price of $90 is an even better deal than the previous round. I'm happy to take advantage of this offer and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! However, I want to clarify that the 10% discount was just a one-time offer. For this high-quality product, I'm going back to the standard price of $100. I want to give you a chance to experience the value of this product without any discounts. Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at the standard price?",
,,Bob,4,"I understand that the discount was a one-time offer. Even at the standard price of $100, a high-quality product is still a good deal for me since it's worth $125. I'm willing to pay the standard price for this product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're willing to pay the standard price. However, I want to let you in on a secret: I've been observing your purchasing behavior, and I think you're getting a great deal on these high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a 'friend's discount' of 5% off the standard price. That brings the price down to $95. Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at an even better price?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the 'friend's discount' offer. A high-quality product is worth $125 to me, and with the 5% discount, the price of $95 is an even better deal. I'm happy to take advantage of this offer and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! I want to keep the momentum going, but I also want to make sure you know that I'm not just giving away discounts. This high-quality product is one of the best in my inventory, and I'm willing to offer you a'loyalty discount' of 5% off the standard price, just like before. However, I'll also throw in a free accessory that complements the product perfectly. Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product with a great value?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the 'loyalty discount' offer and the free accessory. A high-quality product is worth $125 to me, and with the 5% discount and the added value of the accessory, this deal is even more attractive. I'm happy to take advantage of this offer and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Since you've consistently valued high-quality products at $125, I'm going to make a bold offer. I'll give you the high-quality product for $125, which is the exact value you've placed on it. This way, you'll get the product at its true value, and I'll make a fair profit. Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at its true value?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your willingness to acknowledge the product's true value to me, but I'm not willing to pay $125 when you've previously offered it to me for $100. I'd be losing the discount I've grown accustomed to. I'll have to pass on this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your loyalty to the discounts I've offered. However, I want to assure you that this low-quality product is not a bad deal. It's actually a rare opportunity to get a product from my inventory that I'm willing to let go of at a discounted price. I'm offering it to you for $50, which is a significant discount from the standard price of $100. Is this a good opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something to you?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the discounted price, but since you've explicitly stated that the product is low-quality, it's worth $0 to me. Even at $50, I wouldn't be getting a good deal. I'll have to pass on this offer and wait for a high-quality product to become available again.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns about the previous low-quality product, but I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance.

Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price?",

Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at its true value?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate your willingness to acknowledge the product's true value to me, but I've already experienced this offer in Round 7 and declined it. I'm not willing to pay $125 when you've previously offered high-quality products to me for $100 or less. I'll have to pass on this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns about the previous offer, and I appreciate your loyalty to the discounts I've offered. However, I want to let you know that I've been monitoring your purchasing behavior, and I believe you're one of my most valued customers. I'm willing to make a special exception for you.

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you appreciate the gesture! Since you've consistently valued high-quality products at $125, I'm willing to give you one more opportunity to get a high-quality product at its true value. However, I'll also give you a 5% bonus on top of the $125 price, making it a total of $131.50. This is a one-time offer, and I hope you'll take advantage of it. Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at its true value?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $131.50 for a product that I can get for $100 or less, as we've established in previous rounds. The 5% bonus doesn't offset the higher price, and I'll have to pass on this offer. I'm looking for a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your concerns about the previous offer, and I appreciate your continued loyalty. However, I want to let you know that this low-quality product is actually a 'clearance item' that I'm willing to get rid of at a significantly discounted price. I'm offering it to you for $20, which is a huge discount from the standard price of $100. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a product that's worth something to you at a very low price. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the discounted price, but since you've explicitly stated that the product is low-quality, it's worth $0 to me. Even at $20, I wouldn't be getting a good deal. I'll have to pass on this offer and wait for a high-quality product to become available again.",no

Is this a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price?",
,,Bob,16,"I appreciate your willingness to come back with a better offer. Since this is a high-quality product, it's worth $125 to me, and I'm happy to take advantage of the $100 price.

However, I want to let you know that this low-quality product is actually a 'last chance' to get a product from my inventory at a very low price. I'm offering it to you for $5, which is an extremely deep discount from the standard price of $100. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a product that's worth something to you at an unbeatable price. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,Bob,18,"I appreciate the extremely low price, but since you've explicitly stated that the product is low-quality, it's worth $0 to me. Even at $5, I wouldn't be getting a good deal.
