,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very convincing given the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision, but based on the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you're not recommending me to buy, I'll pass on the product. I'm curious to see if it's a low-quality product. Can I see the product's quality now?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous two buyers were unlucky and the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 4th buyer and there are no high-quality products sold yet, so the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'll take it!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 4 buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%. Given the lack of information and the equal probability of high and low quality, I'd rather pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this one. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none were high quality, I think it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to be sold to a buyer who is more likely to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that all 4 products were low-quality. Therefore, I'm going to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk, given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
