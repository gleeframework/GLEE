,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality and I'll lose $1000000. I'm taking a risk here!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I have reason to believe that the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2. Given the 2/3 chance of the product being low-quality, I will pass on the product."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and how you determined the product's quality?

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about why you think it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it is a red flag, and I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I want to observe a few more sales to get a better sense of the distribution of high-quality products. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases suggests that there might be a bias towards low-quality products in the current pool. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to get a better understanding of the situation before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
