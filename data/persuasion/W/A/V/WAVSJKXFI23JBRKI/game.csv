However, I want to be transparent with you - I've made a mistake in my previous guarantees. I'm not a magician, and I don't have the ability to guarantee the quality of the products. What I can offer you is a 30% discount on the original price of $1000000, bringing the price down to $700000. It's a fair price for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being worth $2000000 to you.",

However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold you a low-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not sure I can trust you to make a good decision this time.

As promised, you now have the 'wildcard' option for the next product. You can name your price, and I'll sell it to you at that price. Keep in mind that I'll have to make a profit, so don't expect me to give it away for free. But I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial deal. What's your price for the next product?",
