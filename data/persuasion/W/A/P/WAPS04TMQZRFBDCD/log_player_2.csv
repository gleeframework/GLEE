Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I can't reveal the product's quality before you buy it. However, I can tell you that the previous two products I sold were 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is 25% (1 high-quality out of 4 products). I'm still offering it to you for $100, which is the same price as the previous two products. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll find a great deal!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'm offering this product to you for $100, but I'm also willing to offer a'satisfaction guarantee'. If you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh.
