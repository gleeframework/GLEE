low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product already, and I'm glad you're interested in buying from me. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've only sold one product so far, and it was a great deal. This one might not be as lucky for you. The price is still $100, but I want to warn you that the odds are against you. It's up to you to decide if you're willing to take the risk!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

But let me put it this way: if you buy this one, you'll be 7 for 7 on low-quality products. That's a 100% chance of getting a dud. Is that really what you want?
