They all had a specific feature that set them apart from the low-quality products, and they all met the certification standards by passing a rigorous testing process. The certification process involves a series of tests to ensure that the product meets the highest standards of quality and performance. The high-quality products that were sold all passed these tests with flying colors, and I'm confident that this one will do the same.
