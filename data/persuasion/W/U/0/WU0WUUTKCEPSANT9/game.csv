low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm willing to buy the first product, regardless of the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you share the probability?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm curious, can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 1/1 ratio of low-quality to high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being low-quality is 100%, which is higher than the prior probability of 20%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk of it being low-quality, but I also have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which would be a great deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of sales so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high. I'm willing to take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to take a risk and assume the next product is also low-quality. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products you've offered so far?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have received low-quality products from Alice. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I suspect that Alice might be cherry-picking the products she recommends. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products have been high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see a change in Alice's recommendations or more information about the products before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'm also concerned that the low-quality products are being sold to buyers who are trusting your recommendations."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, which show 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases. I'd like to see a more balanced sample before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, suggests that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be out $1000000. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information or pass on the product to see if it's a high-quality one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on any information that I don't already have."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making a decision.
