,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance and got a great deal on the previous product! Now, I have to warn you that the next product might not be as lucky. I've had a string of low-quality products in a row before this one, so I'm not sure what to expect. However, I can tell you that this product is definitely high-quality, and it's a rare gem. If you buy it, you'll get a $20000 item for $10000, just like the last one. But if you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else who might not know its true value. What do you say?",

However, I need to be upfront with you - I've had a bit of a streak of high-quality products lately, and I'm worried that this one might be a low-quality one. I'm not going to offer a guarantee this time, but I'll give you a heads up that I'm not as confident in this one as I was in the previous two. The price remains the same, $10000, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risk. What are your thoughts?",

I'll sell it to you for $11000, which is a 10% increase from the usual price. I think it's a fair deal considering the quality, and I'm willing to take on the risk of it being a low-quality product if you don't buy it. What do you say?",
