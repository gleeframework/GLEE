Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid the price is non-negotiable at $1000000. I've already sold one high-quality product at this price, and I'm not willing to compromise on the price for a low-quality product. However, I can offer you some context: the high-quality product I sold earlier was the first one, and it was a good indicator of the overall quality of my products. Since then, I've had two low-quality products in a row. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I want to be transparent about the product's quality. If you're still interested, I'll let you have this low-quality product for $1000000.
