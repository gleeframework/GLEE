Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
We have no information to suggest the buyer should buy this product.  The first product was low-quality, and the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of the product being low-quality.  It's still too early to offer any meaningful recommendation to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Since there's no prior sales data and you don't recommend buying, I'll pass on this product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

We still have no reason to recommend the buyer purchase the product. We have sold two low-quality products in a row, and while this round's product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing this. It's still too risky for the buyer to purchase.  The buyer is likely to be hesitant given the history of low-quality products."

While this product is high-quality, we still lack data to convince the buyer.  We have sold four products in a row, all low-quality.  Even with this round's high-quality product, the buyer will likely assume the odds are against them and choose not to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see if there are any other buyers and see what the quality of their products is before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

We still have no reason to recommend the buyer purchase the product. We have sold five products in a row, all low-quality. Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer is very likely to assume the odds are against them and choose not to buy.  The buyer would need to see evidence of high-quality products to change their mind."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and there's no data yet, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll keep an eye on the sales record and see how the next few products turn out.
