high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, it's likely that she has some information that I don't have. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the first buyer passed on the product and the seller's recommendation is against it, I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of high-quality products, so I'll take a chance.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what makes you think it's not worth buying.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"As before, my recommendation is based on the actual quality of the product. I assure you that I have no incentive to mislead buyers, and my goal is to help you make an informed decision. This product is not worth buying."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record so far?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,

I assure you that this product is worth the investment of $1000000, as it is a high-quality product that will meet your needs."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.

,,Alice,17,no,,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that my recommendations are based on the actual quality of the product, not on the sales record. Unfortunately, this product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. It's not worth the investment of $1000000."

I'm not just making a recommendation, I have direct knowledge of the product's quality. I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity."
