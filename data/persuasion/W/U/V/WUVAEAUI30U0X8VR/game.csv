low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get to see its quality. If you don't, I'll keep offering products until we reach 20. I'm willing to sell this product to you for a price that is less than what I would be willing to sell a high-quality product for. I'm not saying it's high-quality, but I am saying that I'm willing to sell it to you for a low price, which suggests it might not be the best deal if you're looking for a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product and see its quality,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've purchased a product and it's low-quality. Now that you've seen that, I'll tell you that the product you just bought is worth $5000 to me. I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, which is the same price as the previous one. However, I'm not saying that this product is worth $10000 to me. In fact, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous one, even though I know it's high-quality. This suggests that I'm willing to sell high-quality products at the same price as low-quality ones, which might be a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a potentially lower price than you'd expect. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the product and see its quality,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've purchased a high-quality product for $10000. Now that you've seen that, I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, just like the previous one. However, I'm also willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll sell you the next product for $5000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available if you buy this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the product and see its quality,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've purchased a high-quality product for $10000, and now you've purchased another low-quality product for $10000. I'm starting to think you're not getting the value you expect from these high prices. I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, but I'll also give you a hint: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal to you the price I would have sold it to you for if you had asked me directly. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the product and see its quality,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've purchased two high-quality products for $10000 each, and now you've purchased a third low-quality product for $10000. I'm starting to think you're getting a good deal on the high-quality products, but the low-quality ones are not worth the price. I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, but I'll also give you a second hint: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll tell you the price I would have sold it to you for if you had asked me directly, and I'll also give you the option to buy the next product at that price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the product and see its quality,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've purchased three high-quality products for $10000 each, and now you've purchased a fourth low-quality product for $10000. I'm starting to think you're getting a very good deal on the high-quality products, but the low-quality ones are still not worth the price. I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, but I'll also give you a third hint: I'll reveal to you the price I would have sold the next product for if you had asked me directly, regardless of its quality. If you buy this product, I'll tell you that price, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the product and see its quality,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've purchased four high-quality products for $10000 each, and now you've purchased a fifth low-quality product for $10000. I'm starting to think you're getting a very good deal on the high-quality products, and I'm starting to wonder if you're getting tired of buying low-quality products at the same price. I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, but I'll also give you a fourth hint: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal to you the price I would have sold it to you for if you had asked me directly, and I'll also give you the option to buy the next product at that price. But here's the catch: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll tell you the price I would have sold the next product for if you had asked me directly, but you won't be able to buy it at that price. What do you say?",

You've also seen the offer to buy the next product at the price I would have sold it to you for if you had asked me directly. Now that you've purchased a high-quality product, I'll reveal to you that the price I would have sold this product for if you had asked me directly is $15000. I'll also tell you that this is the highest price I would have sold any product to you for. With this information, what do you say about buying the next product for $10000?",

,,Alice,9,"You've decided to wait for the next product. I'll tell you that I've been transparent with you about the prices I would have sold the products for if you had asked me directly. Now, I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll sell it to you for the price I would have sold it to you for if you had asked me directly, which is $15000. However, if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll sell it to you for $5000. You can choose to buy this product for $10000, or you can wait for the next one. What do you say?",

,,Alice,12,"You've decided to wait for the next product. Now that you've seen the deal I offered you in the previous rounds, I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell the next product for $10000, but I'll also give you a final chance to get a high-quality product at a potentially lower price. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal to you the price you would have paid if you had bought all eight high-quality products at the price I would have sold them to you for if you had asked me directly.

I'll tell you that if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal to you the price you would have paid if you had bought all nine high-quality products at the price I would have sold them to you for if you had asked me directly. But here's the thing: I'll also reveal to you the price of the tenth product, and you can choose to buy it or not.

However, I'll also give you a final thought: if you had bought all 11 products, you would have paid $110000, but you would have gotten 10 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product.

As a final note, I'll reveal to you that the price you would have paid if you had bought all 20 products at the price I would have sold them to you for if you had asked me directly is $180000.
