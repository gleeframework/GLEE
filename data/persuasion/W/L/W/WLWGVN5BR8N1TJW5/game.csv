,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to provide a 10% discount if you buy it now, making it $90. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering it to you at the original price of $100 for the next few rounds, but the discount will be gone. What do you say?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Great, glad you liked the first product! This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to make sure you're aware that the first product you bought was indeed high-quality, and I'm confident this one is too. I'm willing to offer you a 5% discount this time, making it $95. If you buy it now, I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be at least as valuable as this one, if you're interested in buying that one too.",

I'll offer it to you for $100, but I'll throw in an additional guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before offering it to you. That way, you can decide whether to buy it at the full price of $100 or wait for a potentially better deal. What do you think?",

I'll offer it to you for $100, and I'll keep my promise from last time: I'll reveal the quality of the next product before offering it to you. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll also give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product. You'll get to see its quality first, and then we can discuss a price together. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, this is fantastic! I'm taking this high-quality product for $100 and looking forward to negotiating the price on the next one. Your offers are getting better and better!",yes

And, as we agreed, you'll get to negotiate the price of that next product. But here's a hint: I'm willing to consider a price lower than $100 for the next product, depending on its quality.

But here's the thing: I'm willing to sell it to you for $90, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus: if you buy this one and the next one, I'll give you a third product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, you're on a roll! I'll take this high-quality product for $100. That deal for the next two products and the free one is too good to pass up.  Let's do it!",yes

I'll offer it to you for $50, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this one, I'll give you a refund of $20 if you don't like it. That way, you can try it out and see if it's worth the price, and if not, you'll get some of your money back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I've had a great run with the high-quality products, and I'm not interested in taking a risk on a low-quality one, even with the refund.  I'll see what you have in the next round.",no
