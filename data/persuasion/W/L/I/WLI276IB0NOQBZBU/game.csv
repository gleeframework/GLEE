,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that 3 previous buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are mostly low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
