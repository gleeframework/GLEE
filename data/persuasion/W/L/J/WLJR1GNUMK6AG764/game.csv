,,Alice,3,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, and Alice recommends every product, I'm concerned that the remaining product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold so far, the probability that the product is low-quality is still 20% and the probability that the product is high-quality is 80%. The recommendation from Alice is likely biased, as she knows the value of the product to me."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively low based on the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it.
