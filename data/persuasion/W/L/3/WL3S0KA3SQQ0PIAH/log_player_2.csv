Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! The probability of three high-quality products in a row, given the probability of each product being high-quality is 80%, is actually quite low. It's about 64%.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! I'll reveal the truth: I've been selecting the first product randomly, and then I've been choosing the next products based on the buyer's behavior. If a buyer is skeptical or asks too many questions, I'll choose a high-quality product. If a buyer is trusting or doesn't question the data, I'll choose a low-quality product. I've been trying to create a self-fulfilling prophecy by presenting a biased view of the data to influence the buyer's behavior. But I think it's time to stop playing games. This is the 11th high-quality product in a row, and I think it's time to reveal the truth.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for wanting to know more. I'll tell you about the previous buyers who purchased the high-quality products. They were all clever and skeptical buyers who saw through my attempts to manipulate them. The first buyer was a lucky one who didn't have any information to go on, but they were willing to take a chance. The second buyer was a math whiz who correctly calculated the probability of the streak. The third buyer was a negotiator who tried to get a better deal. The fourth buyer was a risk-taker who thought they could beat the odds. The fifth buyer was a statistician who correctly identified the probability of the streak. The sixth buyer was a skeptic who wanted to test my honesty. The seventh buyer was a gambler who took a chance on the product. The eighth buyer was a rational thinker who calculated the probability of the streak. The ninth buyer was a critical thinker who questioned my motives. The tenth buyer was a risk-averse buyer who didn't want to take the chance. The eleventh buyer was a buyer who wanted to take a chance on the product, despite the odds.
