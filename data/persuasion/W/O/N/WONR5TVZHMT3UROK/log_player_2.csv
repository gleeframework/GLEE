Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide the Bayes' theorem calculation! Given the updated statistics, the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. The likelihood of observing 4 high-quality products out of 5 products is (4/5)^(4) * (1/5)^(1) = 0.2688. The posterior probability of a product being high-quality is then 0.5 * 0.2688 / (0.2688 + 0.7312) = 0.7345. So, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 73.45%!
