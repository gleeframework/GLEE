**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** There's very little data to go on. Only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This doesn't tell us much about Alice's ability to predict quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the product's true quality, her recommendation is a valuable piece of information. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst that happens is you lose $100. But if it's high quality, you gain $300. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario.

**It's important to note that this is a gamble based on limited information and the trust in Alice's recommendation.**"
