A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer in Round 5 bought the product despite my recommendation, and now we have a new piece of information. Since I recommended not to buy the product, and it turned out to be low-quality, this suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%.

I recommended not to buy the product because I thought the probability of a high-quality product being offered was lower than 50%, based on the fact that the previous product I recommended not to buy was low-quality.

However, I should also mention that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is indeed lower than expected (2/5 = 40%). This could be a hint that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is actually lower than 50%.

Given that I have sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 33.33% (2/6).

The product in Round 7 is actually low-quality, and I should not recommend it to the buyer.
