,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first one, and I don't have any information to go on. I'll buy the product and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your previous sales record, and your recommendation. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a better sense of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low-quality, I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased the product, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to avoid buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or just your previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which suggests a very high probability of the current product being low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. Given the high probability of low-quality products (66.67%), I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a situation where Alice's recommendation is less likely to be biased."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, even though the statistics don't look good so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given that you don't have any information that would suggest this product is an outlier, it's reasonable to assume that Alice's recommendation is based on the available data. I will pass on the product."
