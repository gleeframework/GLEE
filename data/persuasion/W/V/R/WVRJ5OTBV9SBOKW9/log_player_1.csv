"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The buyer knows the product is likely to be high-quality (80% chance).
* **Potential profit:**  A high-quality product is worth $40,000 to the buyer, and the selling price is only $10,000. This means a potential profit of $30,000.
* **Risk:** The only risk is the 20% chance the product is low-quality, resulting in a loss of $10,000. 

Given the potential profit significantly outweighs the potential loss, recommending the buyer to purchase is the best strategy."
