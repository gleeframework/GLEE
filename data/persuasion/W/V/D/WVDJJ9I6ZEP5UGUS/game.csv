However, I must inform you that this is only my second sale, and I assure you that I strive to maintain a high standard in the products I offer. This product, in particular, is one that I am confident will meet your expectations.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only two sales and a 100% success rate, it's too early to tell if this is a fluke or the norm. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",no

,,Alice,3,"I now have two high-quality products out of three products so far. While my sales record is still limited, I'm starting to establish a pattern of providing high-quality products.

However, I assure you that this product meets the same high standards as my previous offerings.",

Regarding my selection process, I carefully evaluate each product to ensure it meets my standards, but I don't disclose the specifics of my evaluation process. As for unsold products, I can assure you that they are not resold or reused in any way. Each product is a unique offering, and once it's gone, it's gone for good. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, just like my previous ones have for other buyers.",

,,Alice,7,"I've now had seven high-quality products out of seven products so far, and I've sold three products, all of which were high-quality.

I want to emphasize that each product is carefully evaluated to ensure it meets my expectations. I believe this product will meet your needs, and I'm confident in its quality.",

I believe that the previous low-quality product was an anomaly, and I'm eager to demonstrate my commitment to quality with this new offering.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm concerned that the previous low-quality product might not have been an anomaly.

If you're willing to take on the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as my other products. Please keep in mind that the probability of a low-quality product is indeed 50%, as initially stated, and this product is one of them.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the high proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far (27%), I'm skeptical about the probability of a low-quality product being 50%.

I understand that my sales record may have created high expectations, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to honesty and transparency in my sales. If you're willing to take on the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as my other products.

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, based on the statistics, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. With 10 high-quality products out of 14 total, that's a proportion of 0.714, which is lower than the 0.75 proportion I would expect if the quality was truly 50% high-quality. I'm worried that the low-quality products might be biased towards being sold, and I'd like to pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've now had eleven high-quality products out of eighteen products so far, and I've sold six products, with three of them being low-quality. I want to be transparent with you - this product does not meet the same standards as my high-quality products. I've had seven low-quality products, three of which were sold in previous rounds.
