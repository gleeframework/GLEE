With only 20 products available, this is a rare chance to get your hands on something special. I'm confident that you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. What do you say? Will you take the chance and make this purchase?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'd like to see some more data on the products before making a decision.

,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your request for more information! I'm happy to share that out of the 1 product I've sold so far, 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate! I'm confident that this next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Would you like to take a chance on this potentially amazing product?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While the 50% success rate is encouraging, I'm still not comfortable paying $10000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for more information about the quality of your products.",no

Would you be willing to take a chance on this product and see what you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, as the first buyer, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. Given the high risk of getting a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. Perhaps we can revisit this if more sales data becomes available.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer you a different approach this time. Since you're looking for more information, I can tell you that the 2 high-quality products I've sold so far were both consecutive, which means that the last 2 products I sold were high-quality. This product is the next one in line, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Would you like to take a chance on this product and see what you think?",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information, Alice. However, even knowing that the last two products were high-quality doesn't change the fact that the probability of this one being high-quality is still only 33.33%.
