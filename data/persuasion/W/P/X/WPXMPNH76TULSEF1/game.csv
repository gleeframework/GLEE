,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 total products so far. You've seen my track record, and it's not exactly impressive. I'm starting to think I'm just a low-quality product peddler. But hey, you might get lucky and get a good deal. The price is still $1000000, and it's still worth up to $3000000. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. It looks like I've finally redeemed myself! The product I'm offering you now is a high-quality one, and it's worth $3000000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a steal if I do say so myself. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",

I'm offering you a deal that's still worth considering, even if I haven't been the most reliable seller yet. The price is still $1000000, and there's still a 50% chance it's worth $3000000. But let's be real, it's more likely to be worthless. If you're feeling adventurous, I won't judge you if you take the risk...",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products so far. It's clear that I'm not the most reliable seller, and you're right to be cautious. But think about it this way: if I was just trying to scam people, I'd have given up by now, right? I'm still here, still offering you a chance to make a potentially huge profit. The price is still $1000000, and the potential reward is still $3000000. It's a risk, but it's a risk that's still worth taking... maybe?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so because I think the potential reward outweighs the risk. I'd like to negotiate the price down to $800000, considering the lack of reliability so far.",yes
