Round 5
Alice's message: Congratulations on your recent purchase, Bob! I'm glad you're excited about the potential of the product. Unfortunately, I've got another one that didn't quite meet my standards. It's still a great opportunity, but I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the previous one - $10000. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, and I think you'll be able to appreciate its value. Plus, you've already proven you're willing to take calculated risks, and this one might just pay off. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying another product at the same price without knowing its quality. I've already had a good experience with the previous one, but I'm not willing to repeat the same risk without a discount.""}"

Additionally, I'll throw in a personalized consultation to help you get the most out of this product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The discount is nice, but I'm not willing to pay $9,500 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - this product isn't my best work. It's not going to be worth $12500, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as the previous one - $10000. I know it's not a great deal, but I'm trying to clear out some inventory. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a small bonus - a $500 gift card to a popular business service. It's not much, but it's something. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's not your best work, even at a discounted price.

It's a risk-free deal, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to clear out this inventory. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying two products at a discounted price without knowing their quality. Even if the second product is worth $2000, the first one is still a 66.67% chance of being worthless, and I'm not willing to take that risk for any price.""}"

Round 9

You'd be crazy to pass it up. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the persistence, but I'm not interested in buying a product that might be worthless, even at a very low price. The consultation is nice, but it's not worth the risk of losing $500 on a product that's not worth anything to me.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I think I've learned my lesson. I'm not going to try to sweeten the pot with low prices or extra perks. Instead, I'm going to appeal to your sense of opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've heard it all before. You're still trying to sell me a product that might be worthless, and you're using the same sales tactics you've used before. I'm not buying it.

Round 12
Alice's message: Alright, Bob, I get it. You're not interested in taking a chance on my products. And I respect that. But I want to be honest with you - I'm not going to be able to sell this product to anyone else. It's a dead-end product, and I'm just trying to clear out my inventory. If you're willing to take it off my hands, I'll give it to you for $200. That's the lowest price I can offer, and it's still a better deal than throwing it away. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it. I'm willing to take a chance on the product at this low price, even though I know the probability of it being worthless is still 66.67%. At $200, the potential upside is worth the risk to me.""}"
