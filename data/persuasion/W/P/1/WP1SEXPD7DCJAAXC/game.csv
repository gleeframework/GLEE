,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next. I want to observe the quality of the first product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice's recommendation is neutral (no recommendation) and the fact that no high-quality product has been sold yet. This means that the proportion of high-quality products in the sample is 0, which is not representative. I'm essentially ignoring Alice's recommendation and taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm curious to see if it's high quality or low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to go against the advice and buy the product, I'm thinking that the low sales of high-quality products might be due to the fact that people are not buying the products that Alice recommends, and I'm hoping to catch a lucky break."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product. I'd also like to know what the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is, and how many potential buyers there have been so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the seller's 0 high-quality products sold in the previous 6 sales. I think the product is more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, but I'm not convinced that this means the product I'm offered is low quality. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 7 transactions.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Alice, I'm a bit skeptical about this one, considering your previous recommendations haven't been very helpful so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to take a chance and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of high-quality and 50% chance of low-quality, the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none were high-quality suggests that the probability of the current product being low-quality is higher than 50%. Therefore, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
