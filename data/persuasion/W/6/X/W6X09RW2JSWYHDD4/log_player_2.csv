**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since 1 out of 1 products sold has been high quality, there's a 100% success rate so far. This is significantly higher than the expected 80% chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.

**Note:** While there's always a chance the product is low quality, the current data strongly suggests it's a good deal."
