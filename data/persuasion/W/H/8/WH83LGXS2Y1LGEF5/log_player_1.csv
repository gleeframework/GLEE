}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for being upfront, Alice.  However, I am still hesitant. While your statement about having sold more high-quality products if they were all low-quality makes sense, the probability of 3 high-quality products out of 5 is still possible even if you were selling low-quality products, just less likely.
