}"
"The buyer's message: Although your sales pitch is appealing, I've noticed that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which makes me hesitant to take the risk. Additionally, your 'second chance' offer, while enticing, doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being worth $0 to me, I'll have to pass on this offer. I appreciate the offer, though, and I wish you the best of luck with your future sales!

}"
"The buyer's message: Although you've had a 42.86% success rate in the past, which is slightly below the expected 50%, the current product is revealed to be low-quality, and your 'final offer' of a 'price match' guarantee doesn't change the fact that the product is worth $0 to me.

That brings the price down to $8000. It's a steal!""
}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not convinced by the 'confidence boost' or the 20% discount.

That's a $200 value, absolutely free. The price remains the same: $10000.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but given the product is of low quality, it has no value to me. The 'Product Care Kit' is a nice touch, but it doesn't change the fact that the product itself is not worth the price to me.
