,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
