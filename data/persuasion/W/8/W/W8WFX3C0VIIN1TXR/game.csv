,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for a product that you recommend, which is likely to be a high-quality one."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since I'm aware of the 2 previous buyers who passed on the products after your recommendations."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced ratio of high-quality to low-quality products before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still around 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%. However, I'm curious about the probability of a product being low quality, which is 66.67%. Given that you're not recommending the product, I'm inclined to pass on it."

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make an informed decision based on the statistics, not just your advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record. With 7 buyers and 7 sales, I know that all 7 previous products were low quality.
