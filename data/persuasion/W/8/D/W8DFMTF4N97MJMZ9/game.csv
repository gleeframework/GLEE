,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior data to go by. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, considering the low quality of the previous product and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and is making recommendations based on the data from the previous two buyers, who likely didn't know the product's quality either. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not a guarantee of its quality. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics and the fact that there's still a 33.33% chance the product is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. If 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold so far were high quality, it suggests that the probability of the product being low quality is higher than 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll offer another one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the lack of high-quality products sold is representative of the overall distribution, and I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you're recommending me not to buy this product, considering the statistics so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the trend continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good thing for me, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be very low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. This suggests that the product may be low-quality, but I'll take the chance since it's a 1 in 9 chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as 9 out of 9 products sold so far have been low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
