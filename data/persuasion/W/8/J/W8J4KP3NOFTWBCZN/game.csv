low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is neutral. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is 50%.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,"Honestly, my previous recommendations were based on the actual quality of the product, but I understand that you have no way of knowing that. My sales record is available, and I hope that over time, it will speak for itself.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,,"To correct the previous buyer's statement, 1 high-quality product was recommended but not sold, and 2 low-quality products were sold. I'm recommending against buying this product."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, but I'm willing to take the risk.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,,"So far, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 sold products. I've been recommending against buying the low-quality products. I'm recommending against buying this one as well."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not sure if I should buy it based on the fact that you haven't recommended it and no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision.,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,,"I've recommended against buying the last few products because they were low-quality. Unfortunately, some buyers have chosen to buy despite my recommendations and have received low-quality products. I'm recommending against buying this one as well."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,,"To be transparent, out of the 10 previous products, 4 were bought despite my recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. I'm recommending against buying this product as well."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me, I'm concerned that it might be low quality. If I were to buy it and it's low quality, I'd be the 4th buyer to pass on it, which would suggest a strong indication that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered.",,
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,,"Finally, I have a high-quality product to offer. I've been honest about the quality of the products so far, and I'm confident that this one is worth buying. Out of the 11 previous products, I've recommended against buying the low-quality ones, and some buyers have unfortunately bought them despite my warnings. I strongly recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,,"I understand the previous buyer's concern, but I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. Unfortunately, the previous buyers' decisions and outcomes don't reflect this probability yet. However, I must recommend against buying this product because it is low-quality."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,,
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,,"To provide transparency, out of the 13 previous products, 4 were bought, and none of them were high-quality. However, this doesn't change the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I've recommended against buying the low-quality products, and I'm recommending buying this one because it is high-quality."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that since all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next one.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,,"I understand the previous buyer's concern, but I assure you that my recommendations are based on the actual quality of the product.

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced to buy the product, given your previous recommendations were not very successful, and you're not recommending it. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. To provide more data, out of the 15 previous products, I've recommended buying 4 high-quality products, but none of them were bought. Meanwhile, 4 low-quality products were bought despite my warnings. I'm recommending against buying this product because it is low-quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, and given the statistics that 3 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,,"The statistics are indeed concerning, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine. Unfortunately, the buyers who have purchased products so far have received low-quality ones, despite my warnings. I'm recommending against buying this product because it is indeed low-quality."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales data?",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,,"To answer the previous buyer's question, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, as stated initially. However, I understand that the sales data so far doesn't reflect this probability. Out of the 17 previous products, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and I've recommended against buying the low-quality ones. I'm recommending against buying this product as well."
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to believe it might be low quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,,"I understand the buyer's concern, and I appreciate their cautious approach. Unfortunately, this product is indeed low-quality, and I must recommend against buying it. I hope that the next product will be high-quality and will change the sales statistics."
,,the buyer,19,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and I'd like to take that chance.,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,,"I must advise against buying this product, as it is low-quality. Unfortunately, none of the high-quality products I've recommended have been bought so far, and some buyers have purchased low-quality products despite my warnings. This is the last round, and I hope that future buyers will learn from the sales data and make informed decisions."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you've seen some low-quality products in the previous sales, so I'm cautious.",,
