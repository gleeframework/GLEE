**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know this product is high-quality. Since the buyer doesn't have any information about the specific product, and only knows the general 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, recommending the purchase is the best strategy. 

You have nothing to lose, and a good chance of making a sale."
