"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows that 80% of the products are high-quality, and a high-quality product is worth $30,000 to him. Even though the product is sold for $10,000, there is a strong possibility that the product is high-quality, making it a good investment.  Bob will likely be willing to take the risk, as the potential reward ($20,000 profit) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000)."
