high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see the statistics after the first product is sold, and then make a decision based on that."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and let the next buyer decide, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there is no information about its quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to be the first one to see the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of information from the first buyer. I'm hoping that the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far is just a coincidence."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation from Alice is based on her limited information and I have no reason to believe the product is high-quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since none of the previous two buyers who bought the products were able to get high-quality ones."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that there might be a higher proportion of low-quality products than I initially thought. I'd like to observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me how many products have been sold so far and what the proportion of high-quality products sold is?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm going to pass on this one too. Can you provide more information about the products or your sales process?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high, and the potential reward is worth the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
