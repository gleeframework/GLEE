,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to report that I've sold one product already, and I'm happy to inform you that it was a high-quality one. This means that the ratio of high-quality to total sold products is now 1:1. Considering this new information, I'd like to offer you this product for $10000. It's still a risk, but with the updated statistics, I believe it's a more informed decision. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to think about it for a moment. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, I'm still not convinced that the product I'm being offered is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution! I appreciate your diligence in seeking more data. I'd like to update you on the current statistics: 1 high-quality product sold out of 3 total products sold. I'm offering you this next product for $10000. I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm willing to provide you with a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll offer you the next product at the same price, and you can choose to buy it or not.

Considering the updated statistics, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%.
