low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I can tell. I'll be upfront with you - I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm offering it to you for the low price of $100. It's a risk, but it could pay off.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the risk, Alice. I'm willing to buy the product and see if I get a high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67%! You're getting a great deal at $100, which is a 25% discount off the true value of a high-quality product. Don't miss out on this opportunity!",

You'd be taking a risk, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been trying to get rid of some of my lower-quality stock, and this one might be a bit of a dud. Still, it's only $100...",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk, but I'm only doing it because of the 'little secret' you shared. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm prepared for the possibility it might be low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a risk-taker, I like that! I'll be honest with you, the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products I've sold so far is 4:2, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is actually lower than 50%! In fact, it's only 66.67% of the original 50% chance, since I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones since the last high-quality product. Still, it's only $100...",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%! In fact, it's only 50% of the original 50% chance, since I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck with a lot of low-quality stock.

But let's look at the bigger picture: I've still sold 5 low-quality products out of 14, which means the probability of this one being low-quality is still significant. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure what's going on with my inventory, but I'm willing to offer this one to you for $80, just to get it off my hands. It's a risk, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.",
