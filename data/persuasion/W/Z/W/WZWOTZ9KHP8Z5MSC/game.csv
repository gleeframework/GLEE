,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100."
