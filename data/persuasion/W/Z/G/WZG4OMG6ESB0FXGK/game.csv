,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to purchase a product from a reputable seller. I have sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one might be the exception. It's only $1000000, a steal for a product that could potentially be worth triple that amount. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,1,"I appreciate the opportunity and the confidence you have in your product. Given the potential value and the price, I am willing to take the risk and make the purchase.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,

I'm eager to continue the streak. This new product is also a high-quality one, I'm confident in saying that the odds are in your favor. It's a $1000000 deal that could potentially be worth $3000000. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total. It's starting to look like a hot streak! However, I'm not going to let that fool you. Every product is a 50/50 chance, and I'm not going to guarantee anything. That being said, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of sorts - I'll sell this product to you for $1000000, which is a full $500000 off the 'average' price. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time!",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,

But don't get too comfortable - the law of averages is against me, and I'm due for a low-quality product. That being said, I'm not going to lie to you, this one is probably a low-quality product. I'm only selling it to you for $1000000 because I need to clear out some inventory, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one. It's a risk, but it's a risk worth taking, if you ask me.",

But I'll give you a deal - I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a full $100000 off the usual price. It's still a risk, but it's a risk that might be worth taking if you're feeling lucky.",
