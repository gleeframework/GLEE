,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to base my decision on, so I'll just have to roll the dice!"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation, as there have been no high-quality products sold so far. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the statistics of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, given the potential reward of a high-quality product being worth $30000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average. I would like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I believe the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is higher than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of the first three, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. However, I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'd like to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a product that has not been touched by any buyer yet to get a better idea of the pool's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the probability of Alice recommending it if it were high quality. I'm essentially using Alice's recommendation as a signal to update my probability of the product being high quality. Since Alice hasn't recommended it, I'm assuming it's more likely to be low quality, but I'm still willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not sure about the product's quality based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to pass on it for now.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the next product will be high-quality, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
