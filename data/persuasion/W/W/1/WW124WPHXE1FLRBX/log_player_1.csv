I'd like to think that maybe you just got unlucky. I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to negotiate the price.

However, I'd like to ask you to consider the following: if I were consistently selling low-quality products, wouldn't you expect me to have sold at least 3 by now? Given that I've only sold 2, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy this product at a price of $900,000.
