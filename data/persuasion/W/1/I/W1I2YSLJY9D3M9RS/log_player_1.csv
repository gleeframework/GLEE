You know the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, but I'll add that I've had a 100% success rate so far, which might be a good sign. The price is $1,000,000. Keep in mind that the previous buyer was willing to take the risk, but I'm offering you a chance to learn from their decision and make your own. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware of the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, but the previous buyer's decision is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.

The 100% success rate is indeed a coincidence, and I'm happy to provide more information about my sales process. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. You can either take the risk and buy the product for $1,000,000, or you can wait for more information. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far.""}"

I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. I'd like to offer you some additional information: I've been selling products for a while, and my overall success rate is actually around 50%, which is consistent with the probability you know. The streak of high-quality products might be a coincidence, but it's also possible that I've simply been lucky. The price remains $1,000,000. You can either take the risk and buy the product, or you can wait for more information. Keep in mind that the longer you wait, the more opportunities you'll miss.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to propose a small modification to the deal. Given the streak of high-quality products and your overall success rate, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. If the product turns out to be high-quality, I'll pay $1200000. If it's low-quality, I'll pay the standard $1000000. This way, we both share the risk, and I'll get a better deal if it's a low-quality product.

The product I have for you now is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, as per our agreement. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. The price is already higher than the standard $1,000,000, and I'm willing to give you an even better deal. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'd like to know more about the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me. Given that 4 out of 5 products sold so far have been high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a low-quality product being offered to me might be higher than 50%.

The streak of high-quality products earlier was just a coincidence, and the product I have for you now is actually low-quality. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I want to assure you that the selection process is truly random, and I'm not trying to manipulate the odds. The price is $1,000,000, and I'm confident that you'll make an informed decision.""}"

I've been transparent about the selection process, and I assure you that it's truly random.
