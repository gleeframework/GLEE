If you're interested, I can provide you with a detailed report on its condition, but I'm not obligated to do so. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to start building our relationship, I'm not comfortable buying a product whose condition is uncertain.

This way, you can try out the product risk-free and see the value it brings to your business. The price remains at $10000, but I think the added security makes it an even more attractive offer.
