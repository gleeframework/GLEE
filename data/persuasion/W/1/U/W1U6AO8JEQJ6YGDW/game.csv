,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I've sold 1 product in total. The probability of a product being high-quality is 0/1 = 0%. I'm selling this one for $100. It's a great deal, and you won't find a better price anywhere else!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 0 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 0%. I'm selling this one for $100. It's a low price, but you're essentially buying a product that's worth $0 to you. Think about it carefully before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low quality is very likely and it's not worth the $100 to me.",no

This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price of $100, which is still a great deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is now 3/6 = 50%. But here's the thing: I've sold a lot of products, and the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality should be getting closer to the true probability. I'm selling this one for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great value. Take a chance and buy it!",

I know it's a coin flip, but I'll give you a hint: the probability is actually higher than 50%. I'm selling this one for $100, and I'm counting on you to take a chance on it. If you don't like it, I'll just have to keep trying to sell it to someone else...",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think I might have a few more low-quality products left in my inventory.

Take a chance and buy it!",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I think I can get a good deal and help you clear out some low-quality products. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!",yes

Take a chance and buy it, I think you'll be happy with your purchase!",

Plus, I've got a track record of selling high-quality products now - you can trust that this one is a good one!",

,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability of a product being high quality.
