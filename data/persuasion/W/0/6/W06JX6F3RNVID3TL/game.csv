high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better signal before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is unusually low, so I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy, and considering the low success rate of high-quality product sales, I'm inclined to pass on the product.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
