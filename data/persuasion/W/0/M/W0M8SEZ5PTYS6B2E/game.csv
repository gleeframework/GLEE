,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather more data and I think it's worth a shot."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality. Based on the statistics, I see that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were not purchased, which suggests that they might be low quality. However, I also know that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's the first high-quality product in the sequence."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products recommended by you were low-quality, and I'm not confident in the recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the last chance to potentially get a high-quality product, not because of your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5 products, I think it's more likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a refund if it's low quality"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I want to see if my decision is influenced by the statistics, which suggest that all previous products were low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm going to pass on this one. With 7 out of 7 previous buyers not buying the product, and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to think the probability of this product being high-quality is very low."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this one. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
