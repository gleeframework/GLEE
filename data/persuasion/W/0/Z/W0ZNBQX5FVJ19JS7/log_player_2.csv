``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from the previous buyer. While a high-quality product was sold, it's a very small sample size to draw definitive conclusions.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, as the seller, is likely to recommend buying the product. However, we don't know her motives - she could be incentivized to sell even a low-quality product. 
* **Expected Value:** Despite the uncertainty, the potential upside is significant.  A high-quality product nets a $20 profit, while a low-quality product results in a $100 loss.  Since the chances are 50/50, there's a potential for a positive expected value if we consider a large enough number of purchases. 

**Therefore, taking a calculated risk and buying the product seems like the best option.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I trust your judgment. I'll buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have very limited information about the quality of products, and we don't know what criteria Alice is using for her recommendations. 
* **Positive Signal:**  The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of two purchases suggests that Alice's recommendations might be somewhat reliable, though it's still a small sample size.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, the potential reward of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Note:** This decision is based on a very limited data set. In a real-world scenario, we would need more information to make a more informed decision."
