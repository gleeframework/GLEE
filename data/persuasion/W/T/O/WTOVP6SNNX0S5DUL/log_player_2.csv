Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that the expected value of the current product is still negative. You're asking me to pay $125 for a product that has a 1/3 chance of being worth $200, which means the expected value is (1/3) * $200 - $125 = -$58.33.

You can take it for a song, and I'll even throw in a thank-you gift: I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $50.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're selling a low-quality product for $25, which means it's likely to be worth $0 to me. However, the loss is limited to $25, and I'll get a chance to buy the next product for $50, which could be a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Wait, what? I thought I bought the previous product for $25, but you said I paid $100. That's not what we agreed on. As for the current product, I'm not buying it. You say it's low-quality, which means it's likely to be worth $0 to me. I'm not willing to pay $40 for something that's worthless.
