low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying this product, which is consistent with it being low-quality.

,,Bob,15,no,"I've had two high-quality products in a row after passing on a low-quality product, which is a good sign. However, I'm not going to get too optimistic and pass on this one, since I've been burned before and I don't want to waste money on a low-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. She recommended against the low-quality product in round 12, and now she's recommending this one, which turned out to be high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy this one."
