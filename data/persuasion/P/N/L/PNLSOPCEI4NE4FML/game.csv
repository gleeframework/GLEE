high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your patience. I've now sold 3 out of 5 products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 60%.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the sample size, and I appreciate your skepticism. Upon further reflection, I realize that I may have been too hasty in updating the probability.

The previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product was the 4th buyer I offered the product to. Before that, I had offered the product to 3 other buyers, and 2 of them were low-quality products.

They're thrilled with their purchase and have already recommended me to other buyers. With that said, I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product, which is the 5th one I've offered.
