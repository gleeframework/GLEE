low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll see what I get!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product with a 50% chance of being worthless."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product and the true nature of your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. Your track record isn't very impressive, and I'm hoping to get lucky and get the high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't think your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that you know how much I value it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I suspect that the high-quality products have not been sold yet. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50% based on Alice's previous recommendations. If 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, it's likely that the remaining products are high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on your recommendation, I will pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, considering the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about this product. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up with low-quality products. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product, which is worthless to me, and you're hoping to avoid a low-quality product, which would be a waste of $1000000. I'm taking a risk, but it's a calculated one."
