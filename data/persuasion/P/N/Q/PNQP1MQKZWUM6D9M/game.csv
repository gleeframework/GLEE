low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer, since there's no prior data to go by. I'll make my decision based on the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the 2nd buyer and there are no high-quality products sold so far, so I'm trying to get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low quality, and I'm not confident in the recommendation given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous three buyers who purchased the products were all recommended to buy, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it, not because of the statistics. I think there's a chance the product is high-quality and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information or a better offer."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given the low sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If all 5 previous buyers passed on high-quality products, it's likely that the product I'm offered is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
