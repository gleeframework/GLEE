However, considering the statistics provided, only 1 out of 2 products sold so far was of high quality. This does not significantly alter the original 50% probability of the product being high quality. Given that the product's worth to me is either $200 or $0, and the price is $100, the expected value is $100, which is the same as the price. The guarantee does not change the expected value but eliminates the risk. However, without additional information that would shift the probability of the product being high quality above 50%, I'm not inclined to purchase at this price point.
