,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to offer you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round if you decline this one.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're taking a chance on the next product, but I want to give you a heads up: if you buy this one, I'll offer you a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round if you decline the next one. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available if you buy this product now.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take this product. The potential benefit of a 75% chance of a high-quality product in the next round is too good to pass up, even if this one might be low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took the bait! Now that you've bought one low-quality product, I'll give you a more nuanced offer. I'll tell you that if you buy this product, I'll offer you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round, but also, I'll give you a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product in the round after that, if you decline this one. This is a new offer, not a one-time deal like before.",
,,Bob,3,"I won't fall for it this time. The offer isn't as enticing as before, and I'd rather take my chances on the next products with the given probabilities.",no

,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy customer! I'm glad you're cautious. Now that you've seen a high-quality product, I'll offer you a deal that's hard to pass up.

,,Bob,4,"Wait, I haven't seen a high-quality product yet, but I'll take this deal anyway. A high-quality product is worth $30000 to me, so $8000 is a great price. I'll take it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a shrewd negotiator! I'm glad you took the deal on the high-quality product. Now, regarding this low-quality product, I want to be upfront with you.

Additionally, I'll give you a 10% chance of getting a high-quality product in the round after that, if you decline this one. This is a new offer, and I'm willing to give you a chance to get another high-quality product.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the honesty, but I'll pass on this low-quality product. The chances of getting a high-quality product in the next rounds aren't enticing enough to make me buy a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision! Given that you've seen a high-quality product before and have passed on this low-quality one, I'll offer you a new deal.

,,Bob,6,"Another high-quality product is a great opportunity for me. A $1000 discount is nice, but I'd take it even at the original price. $9000 is a great deal, so I'll buy it.",yes

However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity to buy the next two products at a 20% discount from the original price, if you buy this one now.",
,,Bob,7,"A high-quality product for $7000 is an amazing deal, and the additional discount on the next two products is a great bonus. I'll take it, even if the next two products might be low-quality. The potential savings are too good to pass up.",yes
