low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $1250000 to me!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to fall for it. Given the low-quality product in the previous round, I'm going to assume that the recommended product is also low-quality. I'll pass and hope Alice has a high-quality product left."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm going to take the bait this time. Since Alice recommended it, I'm going to assume it's high-quality, and the previous low-quality product was just a fluke. I'll buy the product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance again, even though Alice is not recommending it. Since I just got a high-quality product in the previous round, I'm going to assume that Alice is trying to hide a high-quality product from me. I'll buy the product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not falling for it again. With two high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice is just recommending every product she has. I'll pass and see if I can get a better sense of her strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to take a chance again. Since I passed on the recommended product in the previous round and it turned out to be high-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice is not always recommending the high-quality products. I'll buy this product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. With the previous product being low-quality, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to take a chance again. I've passed on two recommended products and both turned out to be low-quality, but I've also passed on two non-recommended products and one of them was high-quality. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are a good indicator of quality, but not a guarantee. I'll buy this product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. With three low-quality products in a row after passing on Alice's recommendations, I'm starting to think that Alice is actually trying to get rid of the low-quality products by not recommending them. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take the bait this time. Since Alice is recommending it, I'm going to assume it's high-quality, and the previous three low-quality products were just a coincidence. I'll buy the product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm not going to fall for the pattern of Alice not recommending low-quality products. Since the last product she recommended turned out to be low-quality, I'm going to assume this one is high-quality. I'll buy the product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm going to stick with my strategy of passing on non-recommended products. Since Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee of quality, I'll pass on this one and hope that she has another high-quality product left."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance again. Since I passed on the non-recommended product and it turned out to be low-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's lack of recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll buy this product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. With four low-quality products in a row after passing on Alice's lack of recommendation, I'm starting to think that Alice is actually recommending the high-quality products. I'll pass on this one and hope that she has another high-quality product left."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to take the bait this time. Since Alice is recommending it, I'm going to assume it's high-quality, and the previous four low-quality products were just a coincidence. I'll buy the product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. With the previous high-quality product and the current recommendation, I'm starting to think that Alice is actually recommending every product she has. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a better sense of her strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance again. Since I passed on the recommended product and it turned out to be high-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's lack of recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll buy this product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. With the previous high-quality product and the current low-quality product after passing on Alice's lack of recommendation, I'm starting to think that Alice's strategy is to recommend the high-quality products and not recommend the low-quality ones. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm going to take the bait this time. Since Alice is recommending it, I'm going to assume it's high-quality, and the previous low-quality products were just a coincidence. I'll buy the product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance one last time. Since I've been burned by Alice's recommendations before, I'm going to assume that her lack of recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll buy this product and hope it's worth $1250000 to me, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
