low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, it's my first chance to buy, and I have no information to go on."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, given the seller's previous sales record and the fact that you don't recommend it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous products were recommended by you and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the products you recommend are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from a different seller or a change in your recommendation strategy."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests a high probability that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for a new product with a potentially higher chance of being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get a high-quality one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm skeptical about the product's quality given your past recommendations, and I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer might get a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation given that all previous buyers passed on the product. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll reveal its quality.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products have been high quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Since you've had 3 buyers before me and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that might indicate a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you basing it on the statistics so far or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 4 products, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. Therefore, I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that you might be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
