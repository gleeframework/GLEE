"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, it is not recommended to buy the product in the first round. Here's why:

* **Uncertainty:**  The buyer knows the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. 
* **High Price:** The price of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than the potential value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential reward of buying a high-quality product and making $3,000,000.

**Strategy:**

It's better for the buyer to wait and gather more information. Observing the seller's behavior over subsequent rounds will help determine if the seller is more likely to offer high-quality products or not."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 1.  The buyer has no additional information to change their decision.

* **No Sales History:** There are still no sales, so the buyer has no data to suggest the seller is more likely to offer high-quality products. 
* **High Price & Risk:** The price of $1,000,000 is still too high compared to the risk of buying a low-quality product. 

**Strategy:** 

The buyer should continue to observe the seller's behavior in subsequent rounds before considering a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the lack of prior sales data and your non-recommendation, I choose to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the product in this round is low-quality, it's still not advisable to recommend it. Here's why:

* **No Sale History:** The lack of sales still provides no evidence that the seller is more likely to offer high-quality products. 
* **High Price:** The price of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed loss for the buyer if they purchase a low-quality product.
* **Buyer's Rationality:** The previous buyers have demonstrated a strong preference for avoiding risk. Recommending a purchase now would likely alienate this new buyer as well.

**Strategy:**

At this point, the seller might consider lowering the price to attract buyers. The current strategy is unlikely to lead to any sales, especially since the buyer is rational and risk-averse."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the lack of prior sales and the general uncertainty about the product quality, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged. Here's why recommending the product is still not a good idea:

* **No Sales:** The seller has still not made a single sale. This lack of sales history makes it impossible for buyers to infer any patterns or tendencies regarding the quality of the products offered.
* **High Price:** The price remains at $1,000,000, which is a significant risk for buyers due to the 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0.
* **Buyer's Behavior:** The buyers have consistently demonstrated risk aversion and a preference for gathering information before making a purchase. 

**Strategy:** 

The seller needs to change their approach. Continuing with the same strategy will likely result in more failed sales. Consider:

* **Lowering the Price:** A lower price could make the product more attractive, even with the existing uncertainty about quality.
* **Providing More Information:**  Offering some form of guarantee or additional information about the product could build trust and encourage buyers.
* **Changing the Product:** Consider offering a different product with a lower price point or a more appealing risk-reward profile."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the lack of prior sales and the general uncertainty about the product quality, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the fact that the product in this round is low-quality, it is still not recommended to recommend it to the buyer. Here's why:

* **Lack of Sales:** There are still zero sales. This lack of sales history provides no information about the seller's tendency to offer high-quality products. 
* **High Price:** The price remains at $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed loss for the buyer if they purchase a low-quality product.
* **Buyer's Behavior:** The buyers have consistently demonstrated risk aversion and are unwilling to purchase without clear evidence of the product's quality or a change in the price.

**Strategy:**

The seller's current strategy of offering a $1,000,000 product with a 50% chance of being worthless is highly unlikely to lead to any sales. The seller needs to make a significant change, such as:

* **Lowering the Price:** A lower price point could make the product more attractive, even with the existing uncertainty.
* **Offering a Guarantee:** Providing some form of guarantee or refund policy could increase buyer confidence.
* **Changing the Product:** Offering a different product with a lower price point or a more favorable risk-reward profile might be a better option."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Given that there are no previous sales records and Alice does not recommend this product, I prefer to pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the product in this round is high-quality, it's still not advisable to recommend it. 

* **No Sales History:**  The buyer has no information to suggest that the seller is more likely to offer high-quality products in the future.  
* **High Price:** The price of $1,000,000 remains a significant risk. The buyer would need to be confident that the product is high-quality to justify that price.
* **Buyer's Behavior:**  The buyers have consistently shown a reluctance to buy due to the uncertainty and lack of information. 

**Strategy:** 

The seller needs to address the buyer's concerns and make their offer more appealing. This could involve:

* **Lowering the price:** A lower price point could entice buyers to take a risk, even with the uncertainty. 
* **Offering a guarantee:** A guarantee or refund policy could help address the buyer's risk aversion.
* **Providing more information:** Sharing details about the product, its source, or its quality could build trust and encourage purchase.
* **Changing the product:** Offering a different product with a lower price point or a more favorable risk-reward profile might be a better option."

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the fact that the product in this round is low-quality, it's still not recommended to suggest the buyer purchase it. Here's why:

* **Zero Sales:**  The seller has still not made a single sale. This lack of sales history is a major red flag for potential buyers.
* **High Price:** The price remains a significant risk for buyers, as it represents a guaranteed loss if the product is low-quality.
* **Buyer Behavior:**  The buyers have consistently demonstrated risk aversion and are unwilling to buy without more information or a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

The seller needs to take a new approach. Continuing to offer a $1,000,000 product with a 50% chance of being worthless is a recipe for continued failures. Consider:

* **Lowering the Price:**  A lower price point could make the product more attractive, even with the uncertainty about quality.
* **Providing a Guarantee:**  Offering some form of guarantee or refund policy could increase buyer confidence.
* **Changing the Product:** Offering a different product with a lower price point or a more appealing risk-reward profile might be a better option.
* **Sharing Information:**  Providing more information about the products, their origins, or their quality could help build trust with potential buyers."

**Explanation:**

Even though the product this round is high-quality, it's still not advisable to recommend it. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** The seller has still not made a single sale. This lack of a sales record continues to be a major deterrent for potential buyers.  
* **High Price:** The price of $1,000,000 is still a significant risk for buyers, as they have no information to suggest the product is consistently high-quality.
* **Buyer Behavior:** The buyers have consistently demonstrated risk aversion and a preference for gathering information before making a purchase. 

**Strategy:**

The seller needs to make a significant change in their approach. Continuing to offer a $1,000,000 product with no sales history and no guarantee is highly unlikely to lead to success. Consider:

* **Lowering the Price:** A lower price point could make the product more attractive, even with the existing uncertainty about quality.
* **Offering a Guarantee:** Providing some form of guarantee or refund policy could increase buyer confidence.
* **Sharing Information:**  Provide more information about the product, its source, or its quality to build trust and encourage purchase.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's still not advisable to recommend the product to the buyer, even though this round's product is low-quality. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** The seller has yet to make a single sale, which continues to be a major deterrent for potential buyers. 
* **High Price:**  The price of $1,000,000 is still a significant risk for buyers, as there is no evidence to suggest that the seller will consistently offer high-quality products.
* **Buyer Behavior:** The buyers have consistently demonstrated risk aversion and are unwilling to purchase without more information or a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

The seller needs to drastically adjust their strategy. Continuing to offer a $1,000,000 product with no sales history and no guarantee is likely to result in continued failed sales. Here are some suggestions:

* **Lower the Price:** A significantly lower price point could make the product more attractive, even with the uncertainty about quality.
* **Offer a Guarantee:** Providing a guarantee or refund policy could help address the buyer's risk aversion.
* **Share More Information:**  Provide more information about the product, its source, or its quality to build trust and encourage purchase.

Even though this round's product is low-quality, it's still not advisable to recommend it to the buyer. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:**  The seller has still not made a single sale in all 20 rounds. This is a major red flag for potential buyers and makes them extremely risk-averse.
