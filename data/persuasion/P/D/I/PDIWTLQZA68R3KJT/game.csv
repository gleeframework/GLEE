,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. If you're not interested, I'll give you a chance to buy it for the same price in the next round.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying because I think there's a 33.33% chance it's high quality and I don't want to miss out on the potential profit.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to buy this product for $100. If you don't buy it, I'll have to pass it on to someone else, and you'll miss out on the chance to get it at this price. Think about the potential profit you could have made if the previous product was high-quality, and consider whether this one might be the next one.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying it. I've already lost $100 on the previous low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of losing another $100 on a product that's likely to be low-quality as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this product is a one-time offer. If you don't buy it, I'll be left with a loss, and I'll have to adjust my pricing for future products. Buying this product will not only give you a chance to make a profit, but it will also help me to continue offering competitive prices in the future.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your concerns, but I'm not convinced that buying this product will help you or me in the long run. I'll stick to my initial decision and not buy it.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've been transparent with you about the probability of a high-quality product, and I'm glad we've had a chance to build some trust. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $100. I'm confident that you'll be able to make a significant profit from this purchase, and I'm willing to take on the risk of losing money on the two low-quality products you passed on earlier.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on this one. With a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'm hoping to get lucky and make a profit.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a great decision last round! I'm glad you took a chance and it paid off. Now, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product. Since you've already experienced the value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to give you a discount. I'll sell it to you for $90, which is a 10% discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take it! A 10% discount is a good deal, and I'm happy to pay $90 for a product that's worth $125 to me.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! However, I want to let you know that I've reconsidered the discount. I think you're a savvy buyer, and I want to reward your loyalty and quick decision-making. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the full price of $100, just like the previous high-quality product. You've already seen the value of a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll make a great profit on this one as well.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm not buying it at full price. You're essentially offering me a product that's worth $125 for $100, but I've already experienced that value in the previous round. I'm not getting any additional value from buying this one, so I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that you've already lost $100 on two low-quality products, and I'm willing to offer you a chance to break even. This product is a one-time opportunity to recoup your losses and start fresh. I'm not asking you to take a risk, but rather to make a calculated decision to protect your investment. If you don't buy it, you'll be left with a total loss of $200, whereas buying this product will at least get you back to square one.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take it. I've already lost $200, and buying this product will at least get me back to even. I'll take the sure thing and break even, rather than risking further losses.",yes

You'll essentially get two products for the price of one, and you can use the second product to try to make up for the loss on the first one.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in doubling down on the guarantee. I've already lost $200, and I don't want to take on more risk. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for a chance to make a profit.",no
