,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a high-quality product. I have sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 low-quality products. The price is $1000000. I am willing to sell it to you for this price. If you don't buy it, I will sell it to the next person in line, and they will not know it's high-quality either. Would you like to buy it?",

,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 0 low-quality products. You know that the previous buyer didn't know the product was high-quality, and they still bought it for $1000000. Given the price and the fact that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to the next person in line, and they will not know it's high-quality either. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I trust the statistics and the price you've set. Given that one high-quality product has been sold out of two total products, and considering the price, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 0 low-quality products. You know that the previous buyers didn't know the product was high-quality, and they still bought it for $1000000. Given the price and the fact that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not getting any more information from you, and you're making a decision based solely on the statistics and the price. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to the next person in line, and they will not know it's high-quality either. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,3,"Based on the statistics provided, it seems that purchasing the product could potentially yield a significant profit given the high-quality products sold previously at the same price point. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product. The previous buyers didn't know the product was high-quality, and they still bought it for $1000000. Now, I'm offering you a product, and I want to be transparent with you. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products, which is a 75% success rate. However, I'm willing to sell this product to you for the same price of $1000000. Keep in mind that if you don't buy it, I'll sell it to the next person in line, and they will not know it's low-quality either. Would you like to buy it?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 2 low-quality products. I want to highlight that the last two products sold were both purchased at the same price of $1000000, despite one being high-quality and the other being low-quality. This suggests that the price may not be a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'm offering you this product to you for the same price of $1000000. Keep in mind that you're making a decision based on the statistics and the price, and you won't know the product's quality until after the purchase. Would you like to buy it?",

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 3 low-quality products. I want to point out that you've just seen a pattern where the last three products sold were all purchased at the same price of $1000000, despite two of them being low-quality. This suggests that the price may not be a reliable indicator of the product's quality. Given the current statistics, I'm offering you this product to you for the same price of $1000000. Keep in mind that you're making a decision based on the statistics and the price, and you won't know the product's quality until after the purchase. Would you like to buy it?",
