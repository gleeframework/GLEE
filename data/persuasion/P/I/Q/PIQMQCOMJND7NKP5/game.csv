,,Alice,20,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your desire for more information. I'm happy to provide you with some insights on the products that didn't sell. After reviewing the data, I noticed that the low-quality product that didn't sell was a product that was slightly older than the others. It was one of the first products I produced, and it may have been affected by some minor quality control issues. The other products that didn't sell were mostly due to the buyers being hesitant to take the risk with a new product, but they were all high-quality products.

I'm aware that the previous low-quality product was older and may have been affected by quality control issues. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the quality control measures you have in place to ensure the quality of your products.",yes
