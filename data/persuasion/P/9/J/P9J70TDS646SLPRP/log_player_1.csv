Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the first buyer passed on the product, and we know that the product was high-quality, this buyer's decision is not informative about the quality of the product. The probability of a high-quality product being sold remains 80%.

{

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the second buyer also passed on the product, and we know that the product was high-quality, this buyer's decision is also not informative about the quality of the product. The probability of a high-quality product being sold remains 80%.

However, since two high-quality products have been sold out of three total products, I can infer that the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next round is slightly higher than 80%. I'll take this into account in my recommendation.

{
  ""decision"": ""yes""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Three high-quality products have been sold out of four total products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next round is even higher than before. I'll take this into account in my recommendation.

Since the buyer is aware of the statistics, I'll try to make a more persuasive argument to encourage them to buy.

{
  ""decision"": ""yes""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is unknown and the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. If the product is low-quality, I'd like to negotiate a price reduction to $5000. If it's high-quality, I'm willing to pay the full $10000. What do you think, Alice?
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer is willing to take a risk, but only if they can negotiate a price reduction if the product is low-quality. Since this round's product is actually low-quality, I'll reject their counteroffer.

However, this buyer's willingness to negotiate suggests that they're aware of the potential risks and are trying to mitigate them. This might make other buyers more cautious in the future.

Since this round's product is low-quality, I'll be more cautious in my recommendation.

{
  ""decision"": ""no""

Round 6

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer is willing to take a risk despite my recommendation. Since they asked for the probability of the product being high-quality given that I didn't recommend it, I'll provide it.

The probability of a high-quality product being sold is 80%, and I didn't recommend the product. Assuming independence, the probability of the product being high-quality given that I didn't recommend it is 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8.

However, since the buyer is aware of the statistics, I'll take into account the fact that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 total products. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the next round is even higher than before.

{
  ""decision"": ""yes""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales records and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
