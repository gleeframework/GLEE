* **High-quality product:**  You know the product is high-quality and worth $2,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000, significantly less than the value of a high-quality product.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  
* **No previous data:** There's no history of your sales to influence the buyer.

Therefore, it's a clear recommendation to buy. The buyer stands to make a profit of $1,000,000 if they purchase the high-quality product."
