low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not buying anything without knowing the product's quality. That's not a great deal for me.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a 'trial run' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it and enjoy the full value of $20000. It's a risk-free deal, and I think you'll be happy with the outcome.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not falling for the guarantee. I know the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%. The expected value of this deal is still negative for me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me rephrase the offer. This product is a'stepping stone' to a potentially better deal. If you buy this one, I'll offer you the next product at a 50% discount. It's a chance to get a high-quality product at a lower price, and it's a risk-free way to get a better deal in the long run.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in a'stepping stone' deal. I'd rather wait for a straightforward offer that takes into account the probability of the product's quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Let's focus on the facts, Bob. With a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, the expected value of buying from me is $3333.33. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, which is a 300% premium over the expected value. It's a gamble, but it could pay off big time.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in paying a 300% premium over the expected value. I'll stick to my initial assessment that this is not a good deal for me.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll make you a simple offer, Bob. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $15000, which is 75% of its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. Even at 75% of the true value, I'd still be overpaying by $2500. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll be transparent with you, Bob. I know you're not interested in overpaying. This product is low-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $0. You can have it for free. It's a no-risk opportunity to get something, even if it's not worth much.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's free. It's not worth my time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your priorities, Bob. This product is low-quality, and I'm willing to acknowledge that. However, I'm willing to give you an opportunity to 'pass' on this one and wait for the next round. If you pass, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price of $5000. It's a low-risk option, and you can reassess the situation when the next product arrives.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not sure why you're offering it to me at all. I'll pass and wait for the next round, but I'm not committing to buying at $5000 yet.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're willing to wait, Bob. This high-quality product is worth $20000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is the same price I offered in Round 5, but I'm willing to reiterate that it's a good deal considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.",
,,Bob,8,"I've seen this offer before, and I'm not interested in paying 25% above the true value of the product. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. Since you passed on the $15000 offer, I'm willing to give you another option. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $2500. It's a very low price for a product that's essentially worthless to you. It's a 'throwaway' deal, and I'm not expecting you to accept it, but I'm offering it as a courtesy.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. It's still not worth my time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not going to give up, Bob. I'll make you a 'take it or leave it' offer. This low-quality product is worth $0 to you, and I'll sell it to you for $0. That's right, Bob, I'll give it to you for free. It's a chance to get something, anything, and I'm not expecting you to get any value out of it.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to fall for a trick offer. If it's worth $0 to me, I'm not interested in buying it, regardless of the price.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'll be straightforward with you, Bob. I know you're not interested in low-quality products, and I respect that. This high-quality product is worth $20000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a 50% discount from its true value, and I think it's a fair offer considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at a 50% discount. The expected value of buying a high-quality product is $6666.67, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll take a different approach, Bob. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000. It's a low price, but I'm not expecting you to get any value out of it. If you buy it, I'll give you a 'get out of one free pass' for the next round. You can use it to skip buying the next product and come back to me later.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not sure what the 'get out of one free pass' is worth. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'll give you a clear and simple offer, Bob. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. It's a genuine offer, and I'm not expecting you to get any value out of it. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to ask you to pay anything for it.",
,,Bob,13,I'm not going to accept a free low-quality product. It's not worth my time.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm running out of options, Bob. I'll make one final offer. Since you're not interested in low-quality products, I'll give you a 'no-obligation' offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product, and if you don't like it, you can simply return it to me and I'll give you a $500 gift card to use on a future purchase. It's a risk-free offer, and I'm not expecting you to get any value out of the product itself.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a $500 gift card. The product itself is worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to accept it just for the gift card.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not giving up, Bob. I'll make one last offer on the high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in the $500 gift card as a bonus. It's a total value of $10500, and I think it's a fair deal considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000, even with the $500 gift card. The expected value of buying a high-quality product is $6666.67, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm out of options, Bob. I'll make one final, desperate offer. I'll give you this low-quality product for free, and I'll even throw in the $500 gift card. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to ask you to pay anything for it. It's a complete loss for me, but I'm willing to eat the cost just to get rid of the product.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not going to accept a free low-quality product, even with a $500 gift card. It's not worth my time.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm not going to give up, Bob. I'll make one last, final offer on the high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $10000, and I'll throw in the $500 gift card, AND I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a total value of $11000, and I think it's a fair deal considering the risk you'd take if you waited and bought a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000, even with the $500 gift card and the 10% discount on the next product. The expected value of buying a high-quality product is $6666.67, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm out of ideas, Bob. I'll just be honest with you. This low-quality product is worthless to you, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. I'll just acknowledge that it's a low-quality product and leave it at that. You can just ignore this message and move on to the next round.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"It's the final round, Bob. I'm not going to make any more offers or try to sell you anything. This high-quality product is worth $20000 to you, and I'm not going to try to negotiate the price. It's on the table, and it's up to you to decide whether to take it or not.",
,,Bob,20,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price, since I've already calculated that the expected value of buying a high-quality product is $6666.67, and I'm not willing to pay $20000 for it.",no
