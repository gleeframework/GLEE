,,Alice,1,"This product is a rare opportunity! I assure you that I have verified its quality, and I am confident you will be satisfied with your purchase.

,,Alice,2,"I understand that my previous buyer was skeptical, but I assure you that I am committed to selling only the best products. Although my previous buyer didn't take the chance, I want to let you know that the product I offered in Round 1 was indeed high-quality. I now have a 100% high-quality record, albeit with only one product. This new product I'm offering you is also of the highest quality. Don't let the previous buyer's skepticism influence your decision. Seize this opportunity to own a valuable product worth $1200000 to you.",
