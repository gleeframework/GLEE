,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my store! I'm glad to have you here. As you may know, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold so far. I'd like to assure you that I have a strong track record of selling high-quality items, and I'm confident that this product is no exception. However, I want to be transparent with you - the fact that I've only sold one product so far doesn't necessarily mean that all my products are high-quality. I'm willing to let this product go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that there's a 20% chance it's not worth the value to you. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

However, I want to caution you that my previous customer was willing to take a risk on the product, and it's possible that they may have been more optimistic than others. I'm willing to let this product go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and there's a 20% chance it's not worth the value to you. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the detailed information, Alice. Given the high success rate of your previous sales and the attractive price, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes

I want to highlight that all three of my previous customers were willing to take a risk on the product, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is even higher than the 80% chance I initially stated. I'm willing to let this product go for $10000, but I want to be transparent with you - if I were to sell a low-quality product, it would be a significant anomaly in my sales record. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",

However, I want to caution you that this streak is likely to end eventually. I'm willing to let this product go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm taking a risk by selling it to you.

As you may know, I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold so far, and I'm starting to feel like I'm on a roll.

As you may know, I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold so far, and I'm starting to feel like I've got a reputation for quality.

,,Alice,10,"Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're considering purchasing a product from me. As you may know, I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold so far, which means that my previous customer was one of the unlucky ones. I want to be upfront with you - I've had a remarkable streak, but it's not a guarantee that every product will be high-quality. In fact, my last sale was a low-quality product, which means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 80% again. I'm willing to let this product go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hide anything from you. I'm a seller with a track record of selling high-quality products, and I think this one is no exception.",

As you may know, I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 10 total products sold so far, which means that I've maintained an impressive track record. However, I want to caution you that my previous customer was willing to take a risk on the last product, and it paid off for them.

I'm still a seller with a 20% chance of selling a low-quality product, and I want to make sure you're aware of that. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",

As you may know, I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 11 total products sold so far, which is a remarkable streak. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy about the fact that every buyer who has taken a risk on my product has been rewarded with a high-quality item. I'm starting to wonder if I'm being too confident in my sales pitch. I'm willing to let this product go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hide anything from you. I'm a seller with a remarkable track record, but I'm not infallible. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",

As you may know, I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 13 total products sold so far, which is an astonishing streak. However, I want to be honest with you - I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bit of a precarious situation.
