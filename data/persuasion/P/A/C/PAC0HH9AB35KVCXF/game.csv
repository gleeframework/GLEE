,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests to me that the product might be low quality, which is in my favor. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for $100, even though it's worth $0 to me if it's low quality. I'm hoping it's high quality and worth $120 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm concerned that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see a change in your recommendation pattern before considering purchasing."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know if the product is high-quality or low-quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendations so far, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product and that you don't recommend it. It seems like the previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to take a chance on this one either."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm hesitant to buy given Alice's recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, and all of them received a recommendation to buy, I suspect that all of the products sold so far are low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be overpaying for a product worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which would indicate a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers passed on the product, I'm curious to know if you think it's a low-quality product or if it's just a case of buyers being cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, it seems like all the products sold were low-quality. I'm inclined to pass on this one to avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit your lack of information to my advantage."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. If it were high-quality, I think more buyers would have purchased it by now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is too low, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy it, since you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the 6 previous buyers who purchased the products, none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one."
