low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and the potential reward is high enough to make it worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the probability might be skewed towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the 0/1 sales ratio of high-quality products and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it might be the first high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit your lack of information and get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues or if the previous buyers just got unlucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on the previous sales record, and Alice's recommendation suggests that it's likely low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, and considering the product's price of $10000, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm not convinced that the current product is high quality."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.
