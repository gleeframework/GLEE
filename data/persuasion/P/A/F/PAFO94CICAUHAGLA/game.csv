high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that there's a high likelihood of it being low quality, which would mean a loss of $1000000. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that your recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products, which further increases my skepticism."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold, which seems to be a very low proportion of high-quality products.
