Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I'm glad the first buyer took a chance, and it paid off! Now, I'd like to assure you that my sales record is not a reflection of the quality of the products I have available. In fact, I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product to any buyer.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that my sales record is just a coincidence. The probability of a high-quality product remains the same at 33.33%. I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of this chance. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 attempts, which means I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next 2 attempts.
