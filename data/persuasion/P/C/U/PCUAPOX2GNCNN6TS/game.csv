low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're interested in our quality control process! We have a rigorous evaluation process in place to determine the quality of each product. Our team of experts carefully examines each product, considering factors such as materials, craftsmanship, and overall construction. We use a proprietary algorithm to assess the product's quality, and if it meets our high standards, it's deemed high-quality. If not, it's categorized as low-quality. This process ensures that our customers receive only the best products. This new product, unfortunately, didn't meet our quality standards, which is why it's classified as low-quality.
