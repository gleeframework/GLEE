"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, I would not recommend buying the product in round 1. Here's why:

* **Unknown Quality:**  While the seller claims the product is high-quality, I have no information to confirm this.  
* **High Price:** The price of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than the potential value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000). Even if it is high-quality, the profit margin is very low.
* **Risk:** There's a 50% chance the product is low-quality and worth $0. In this case, I would lose the entire $1,000,000.

**Strategy:** It's better to wait and see how the seller behaves in future rounds. If they consistently offer high-quality products, their reputation will improve, and I might consider buying."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd like to see how the product fares with other buyers before making a decision.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

I still recommend not buying the product in round 2. Here's why:

* **No Information:** I have no information about the quality of the product in this round.
* **Previous Round:** The seller's previous offer was not purchased, indicating that buyers are hesitant and may suspect the seller's claims. 
* **High Price:** The price remains high, and the potential for a loss (if the product is low-quality) is significant.

**Strategy:**  It's crucial to observe the seller's behavior over multiple rounds. If the seller starts to offer products at a lower price or provides more convincing information, I might reconsider buying. However, for now, the risk is too high."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate the transparency, but I'll pass on this product.  I'd like to see some sales history before committing to such a large purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

I still recommend not buying the product.  Here's why:

* **No Information:**  I still have no information about the quality of this round's product.
* **Seller's Track Record:**  The seller has failed to sell two products in a row, further reinforcing the suspicion that the seller may be offering low-quality products. 
* **High Risk:** The price is still extremely high.  Purchasing at this point would expose me to a significant financial risk with no guarantee of return.

**Strategy:**  I will continue to observe the seller's behavior, hoping to see a pattern that suggests they are offering high-quality products or a more attractive price point.  At this stage, the risk of purchasing is simply too great."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm hesitant to buy without any information about the product's quality. Since there's a 50/50 chance of it being worthless, I'd prefer to pass for now. Perhaps I'll consider buying if there's more data on the quality of the products being sold.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this round's product is high-quality, I still recommend not buying it. Here's why:

* **Seller's Track Record:** The seller has failed to sell three products in a row. This pattern strongly suggests they are either offering low-quality products or are using deceptive tactics. 
* **Lack of Transparency:** The seller has provided no evidence or information to support their claim of high-quality. They've simply stated it without any proof or explanation. 
* **High Risk:** The price is still very high, making the potential for a loss significant.  Even if this product is high-quality, the seller's lack of credibility makes it unwise to trust them.

**Strategy:** I will continue to observe the seller's behavior and wait for a more compelling reason to purchase. This could involve a price reduction, more transparency about product quality, or a demonstrably positive track record of selling high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Given that there is no sales history and the product is not recommended, I will pass on this purchase. 
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite this round's product being high-quality, I still recommend not buying it. Here's why:

* **Seller's Consistent Failure:** The seller has now failed to sell four products in a row. This consistent pattern strongly suggests a significant problem with either the quality of the products or the seller's trustworthiness.
* **Lack of Transparency:** The seller still provides no information or evidence to support their claims about product quality. This lack of transparency further fuels suspicions about their motives. 
* **High Risk:** The price remains extremely high, making the potential loss significant. There is no compelling reason to take such a large financial risk when the seller's track record is so negative.

**Strategy:**  I will continue to observe the seller's behavior, hoping to see a significant change in their approach. A price reduction, a demonstrably positive track record of selling high-quality products, or increased transparency about product quality would all be necessary before I would even consider buying."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there is no prior data to suggest the product is likely to be high quality, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

I still recommend not buying the product in round 6. Here's why:

* **Consistent Failure:**  The seller has failed to sell five products in a row, a clear indication that there are serious problems with either the product quality or the seller's approach. 
* **No Improvement:** The seller has shown no signs of changing their strategy or offering any reassurance about product quality. 
* **High Risk:**  The price remains extremely high, with no evidence to suggest that the product is anything other than worthless. 

**Strategy:**  It's crucial to observe the seller's behavior for several more rounds.  If they continue to fail to sell products and offer no explanations or improvements, it's highly likely that they are deliberately selling low-quality products. At this point, any purchase would be a significant financial risk with a very high chance of loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but given the lack of information on the product quality and the risk of getting a low-quality product, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite this round's product being high-quality, I still recommend not buying it. Here's why:

* **Consistent Failure:** The seller has now failed to sell six products in a row. This pattern is extremely worrisome and suggests a consistent pattern of offering either low-quality products or deliberately misleading buyers.
* **Lack of Trust:**  The seller has shown no evidence of being trustworthy or reliable. They've offered no explanations, provided no evidence to support their claims, and haven't changed their approach despite the consistent lack of sales.
* **High Risk:** The price remains incredibly high, making the potential for a loss significant. Even if this product is high-quality, there's no guarantee that future products won't be low-quality, and the seller's lack of credibility makes it unwise to trust them.

**Strategy:** I will continue to observe the seller's behavior, hoping for a significant change that demonstrates trustworthiness and product quality. At this point, the risk of purchasing is simply too high."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since this is the first product and there's no data on quality, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see how the quality of future products plays out.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

I still recommend not buying the product in round 8. Here's why:

* **Consistent Failure:** The seller has failed to sell seven products in a row. This is an extremely concerning pattern that strongly suggests there are significant issues with the quality of the products or the seller's trustworthiness.
* **No Change in Strategy:** The seller hasn't provided any information or evidence about product quality, hasn't changed their pricing strategy, and hasn't offered any reassurance to potential buyers.
* **High Risk:** The price remains extremely high, meaning a purchase is a significant financial risk with a high chance of loss.

**Strategy:** At this point, it's highly likely that the seller is deliberately offering low-quality products or engaging in deceptive practices. It's crucial to continue observing the seller's behavior for several more rounds before even considering a purchase. Any purchase at this stage would be incredibly unwise and likely result in a significant financial loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate the information, I'm hesitant to buy without any previous sales data.  I'd like to see how others have fared before committing to such a large purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite this round's product being high-quality, I still recommend not buying it. Here's why:

* **Consistent Failure:** The seller has now failed to sell eight products in a row. This is a devastating track record that leaves no room for doubt – there is a significant problem with either the product quality or the seller's trustworthiness.
* **No Trust:** The seller has not addressed concerns about product quality, offered any evidence to support their claims, or changed their strategy to make their offers more appealing. This complete lack of transparency and effort only reinforces suspicions about their intentions.
* **High Risk:** The price is still exceptionally high, making the potential loss significant. Even if this product is high-quality, the seller's consistent failures to sell suggest a much greater likelihood of future low-quality products.

**Strategy:**  It's clear that this seller is operating with a pattern of deception or offering consistently low-quality products.  I strongly advise against purchasing anything from this seller until they demonstrate a significant change in their approach, including:

* **Transparency:** Providing evidence or information about product quality.
* **Lower Prices:**  Offering more reasonable prices that reflect the risk of low-quality products.
* **Positive Sales History:** Demonstrating a track record of successful sales with high-quality products.

Until then, purchasing anything from this seller is an incredibly risky gamble with a very high likelihood of financial loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this product.  Given the lack of information and your recommendation against it, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

I strongly recommend not buying the product in round 10.  Here's why:

* **Overwhelming Evidence:** The seller has failed to sell nine products in a row. This is a catastrophic record that leaves absolutely no doubt that something is seriously wrong, either with the product quality or the seller's intentions.
* **No Trust:** The seller continues to provide no information or evidence to support their claims about product quality, and they've offered no explanation or change in approach despite their consistently failing to sell. 
* **Extreme Risk:**  The price is still incredibly high, meaning a purchase is a huge financial risk with an extremely high chance of loss. At this point, it's almost guaranteed that the seller is offering low-quality products.

**Strategy:** It's now clear that this seller is either operating with a deliberate pattern of deception or offering consistently low-quality products. There is no reason to believe that anything will change.  It would be incredibly reckless and foolish to consider buying anything from this seller."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait and see how others react.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no sales history yet, and you are advising against the purchase, I'll pass for now.
