Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. I'm glad to see that my high-quality products are meeting expectations. However, I want to be transparent with you - my success rate is a bit higher than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. This one is a new product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I think it's worth considering.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 so far, which is still a 40% success rate. I want to give you a more nuanced view of my sales history. If I were selling only high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold 1.67 high-quality products out of 5 (33.33% probability). The fact that I've sold more than that suggests that I might be selling some low-quality products. This one is a new product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I think it's worth considering.
