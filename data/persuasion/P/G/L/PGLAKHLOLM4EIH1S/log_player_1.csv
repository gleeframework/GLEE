This way, you'll get a good deal, and I'll be able to move this product off my inventory.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure what to make of your statement that this product is lower quality. If it's really not as good as the one in Round 3, I'm even more hesitant to buy it. The free accessory doesn't change my mind, and I'd rather wait for the next product.

}"
