,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, but since I just lost $100 on the last one, I'd rather not take the risk. I'll pass."

,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've been burned twice before, and Alice has recommended this one, which makes me think it's probably low-quality. I'll pass."

,,Alice,6,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take a step back and think about this. If Alice is consistently recommending low-quality products when she recommends them, but I'm getting low-quality products when I buy when she doesn't recommend them, then maybe the recommendation is actually a good indicator of quality. I'll buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
