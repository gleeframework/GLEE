,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 products sold, which means there's a 50% chance of the product being low-quality. Given the 50-50 odds, I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $10000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because you think the product is low quality or because you think it's high quality but I'm not a good fit?
