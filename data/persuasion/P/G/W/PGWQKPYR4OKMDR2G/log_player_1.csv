I've been in the business long enough to know when a product just isn't going to pan out, and I'm afraid this one falls into that category. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I'm being completely honest - this product is not worth the $1,000,000 price tag. In fact, I'm surprised I'm even offering it to you at this price. If you're looking to break even, you might consider this opportunity, but if you're expecting a return on investment, I'd advise against it.""
