"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product worth potentially $1200000. I'm confident that this product has the potential to exceed your expectations. However, I want to be transparent with you - this is the first product of a new batch, and I'm not sure if it's a high-quality one. I'm willing to offer it to you at the discounted price of $100000. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $100,000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait and see the next product.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible products. Since the previous product didn't meet your expectations, I'm willing to offer you a 'no-risk' deal. I'll sell you this next product for $100000, but I'll also include a 100% refund guarantee. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll refund your money immediately. This way, you have nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the refund guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $100,000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see the next product, as the expected value of this one is still negative.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm glad you're being cautious. However, I'm confident that this next product is a high-quality one. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 'certification' that this product is indeed high-quality. If you buy it, I'll provide you with a unique serial number that you can verify with me at any time. If it turns out that the product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $50000 on top of the purchase price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not convinced by your certification. Since I know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm not willing to pay $100,000 for a product that has only a 1/3 chance of being worth $1,200,000 to me.""

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'll sell you this product for $50000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving you a 2-for-1 deal on the expected value of the product. If you buy it, you'll still have a 33.33% chance of getting the full $1200000 value, and a 66.67% chance of getting $0. Considering the potential upside, I think this is a risk worth taking. What do you say?

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase, Bob! I'm glad you took the chance and got the product at a discounted price. Since you've already experienced a low-quality product, I want to reassure you that I'm committed to providing you with better options. This next product is a new shipment, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality one. However, I want to make it even more appealing to you. I'll give you a 'price adjustment' based on your previous purchase. If you buy this product, I'll give you a $20000 discount on the original price, making it $80000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

The voucher will be worth $100000, which is more than the original price of the product. If you buy this product, you'll essentially be getting a free high-quality product in the future.

Round 9
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase, Bob! I'm glad you took the chance and got the product at a discounted price.
