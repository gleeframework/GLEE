,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate the sales record and the previous buyer's feedback. However, I'm concerned that the previous sales record may be misleading. With only 3 products sold, the sample size is very small, and the fact that all 3 were high-quality is unlikely to be representative of the true quality distribution.
