,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. It's worth every penny, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you because I think it's a great fit for you.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing it because I have to play along with the game, not because I think it's a good value for me.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to give my product a chance. This one is even better than the last one, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I have to warn you, the last product you bought was a great deal, and this one might be even more valuable. If you're feeling lucky, I think you should take it.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not feeling lucky, and I'm not paying $1000000 for another product without knowing its quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is a game-changer. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $900000, but I need you to understand that this is still a high-quality product that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to take on some risk by offering a discount, but I need you to take the leap of faith.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not willing to take the leap of faith. I'll pass on this one too.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I want to assure you that this product is still a great opportunity. It's a unique item that will allow you to get a feel for the type of product I'm offering, and it's a chance to get a head start on our potential partnership. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1000000, but I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a product just to get a feel for the type of product you're offering, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for it. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I want to make it clear that this product is a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's normally worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000, and I think it's a steal. I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get it off my hands, so I'm making a one-time offer that's hard to refuse.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in paying $50000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously, Bob. Let me make it clear: this product is worth $2000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. That's a 60% discount, and I'm throwing in a free inspection to ensure you're satisfied with the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I think you're being unreasonable.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not taking you seriously because you're not being honest about the product's quality. You're trying to sell me a low-quality product for a price that's 80% of its supposed value. I'm not falling for it. I'll pass.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I don't blame you for being cautious. But let me assure you, this product is the real deal. I'm willing to offer you a'satisfaction guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll start fresh. But if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $800000. I'm putting my reputation on the line with this offer.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even with a satisfaction guarantee. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm starting to think we're at an impasse, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you a 20% discount on the price, making it $800000, and I'll also throw in a 10-year warranty. This warranty will cover any potential issues with the product, and I'll personally guarantee its quality. I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to make it because I value our potential partnership.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in paying $800000 for a product that I know has an 80% chance of being worth $2000000 to me. The warranty and discount don't change the fact that I'm taking a risk by buying a potentially low-quality product. I'll pass.",no

,,Alice,10,"Great, Bob! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Since you've already taken the option to buy the next product for $900000, I'll make you a special deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $950000, and I'll also throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it before you buy the next product. That way, you can see the quality of this one before committing to the next one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying the product now, and the bonus offer doesn't change my decision. I'll stick to the original option to buy it for $900000 at the end of the next round.",no

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Bob, I think we're at a stalemate. I'm willing to sell you this product for $900000, which is the price you've already agreed to pay for it next round. I'll give you a 'pre-emptive buyout' option: you can buy it now for $900000, and we'll skip the next round altogether. You'll get the product and avoid the risk of it being low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying the product now, and I'm not willing to pay $900000 for it. I'll stick to my original plan and wait for the next round.",no

I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm being completely honest with you: it's a low-quality product. You know the value it holds for you is $0. I'm essentially giving it away. If you don't want it, I'll just take it back and we can move on to the next round. What do you say?",
