**Explanation:**

Even though there is a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the recommendation from Alice adds valuable information.  Here's why:

* **Alice's knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is likely to recommend it if it is high quality.
* **Previous data:** The fact that a previous buyer purchased a high-quality product based on Alice's recommendation suggests that her recommendations are reliable. 

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product outweighs the risk, given the positive signals from Alice's recommendation and the previous sale."
