**Explanation:**

* **The Data:** We know that 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This means the seller has a perfect record of recommending high-quality products.
* **The Risk:** While there is a 50/50 chance of any given product being high or low quality, the seller's perfect track record suggests they have some way of discerning quality, even if they don't know our personal valuations.
* **The Decision:** It's a gamble, but the potential payoff of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.  Given the seller's accuracy so far, it makes sense to trust their recommendation."
