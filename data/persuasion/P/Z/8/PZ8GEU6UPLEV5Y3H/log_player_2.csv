It's a... let's call it a 'utility item' that's designed to make your life a bit easier. It's not something that's going to change your life dramatically, but it's a nice-to-have that you might find useful in certain situations. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not the most exciting product, but it's a decent item that's worth $0 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.

I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with it, but I'm hoping you might be able to find some use for it. It's a bit of a 'take it or leave it' situation.
