high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the outcome of the product quality before making a decision, and I'd like to know the recommendation you would give to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to be contrarian."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide me with the price and the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3 products, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I think Alice's recommendation is likely biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, it's possible that the remaining products are also high-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that has been sold to a previous buyer, to get a better idea of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to buy the product. Your track record of recommendations is 0 high-quality products sold out of 3. I think you're not very good at judging quality.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 80% probability. I think it's likely that the product is low-quality and I don't want to risk buying it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products before me and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased the product, I suspect that the products recommended to buy are likely low-quality. I would like to pass on this product and see if you will recommend it to the next buyer."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous 3 buyers?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality based on the current statistics. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'm concerned that I might be getting a low-quality product as well."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 80% and the probability of a low-quality product being selected is still 20%. With this information, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
