high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see what you're getting at! Based on the data, I can estimate that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. This is because, out of the 2 products sold, 1 was high-quality, and out of the 3 products offered to buyers who passed on the product, 1 was high-quality.
