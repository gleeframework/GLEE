This means that the current product is likely to be one of the 6.5 high-quality ones. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the increased likelihood of its high quality.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your reasoning. I'd like to see the actual probability calculation. If there are 13 products left, and 5 high-quality ones have been sold out of 7, the probability of the remaining products being high-quality is still 50%, not 6.5.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that you've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8, which means 2 were low-quality.
