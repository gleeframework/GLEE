Alice's message: Fair enough. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 14. To be honest, I don't really 'determine' which products are high-quality - I just get a batch of products and sell them as they come. But I can tell you that the high-quality products are the ones that are worth $300 to you. The low-quality ones are, well, not worth anything.

Alice's message: You're a statistician, eh? Alright, I'll give you the numbers. With 3 high-quality products out of 14, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 21.43%. But here's the thing: the high-quality products seem to be coming in at a rate that's roughly consistent with the initial 33.33% probability we started with. So, if you assume that the probability hasn't changed, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually around 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance and see if you can get a high-quality product?

Alice's message: I was just thinking out loud, but I suppose I should clarify. My reasoning is based on the idea that the probability of a high-quality product is a fixed 33.33%, and that the low-quality products I've been selling are just a random sample from the batch. If that's the case, then the probability of the next product being high-quality should be the same as the overall probability, which is 33.33%. Of course, this is just a guess, and I could be wrong. Would you like to take a chance and see if I'm right?

Alice's message: With 4 high-quality products out of 18, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 22.22%. But wait, that's not the whole story. We've had 4 high-quality products in a row now, which is a bit suspicious. If we assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, the probability of 4 high-quality products in a row is actually quite low.
