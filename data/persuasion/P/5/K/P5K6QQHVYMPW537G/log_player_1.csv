Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far. Our statistics show that 50% of our products are high-quality, which is lower than the initial 80% probability. We're not sure what's going on, but we're offering this product to you for $10,000. It's a chance to take a calculated risk and potentially get a great deal. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand that the current statistics show a lower percentage of high-quality products than initially stated. However, with only 2 products sold so far, the sample size is too small to make a conclusive decision. I'll take the calculated risk and buy the product, considering the potential value of $40000 is still greater than the cost of $10000, even with the revised probability.

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a much better ratio than our initial 50% statistic. It seems our initial products were just a fluke. We're now at 66.7% high-quality products sold, which is much closer to the 80% initial probability. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price of $10,000. Don't miss out on this chance to get a $40,000 value product for a fraction of the price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. The current statistics seem to be in line with the initial probability, and I believe I have a good chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk to get a $40000 value product for $10000.

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""We've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4, which is a very promising ratio. However, we want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and our statistics are becoming more reliable. We're now at 75% high-quality products sold, which is even closer to the initial 80% probability. But, we've also sold a low-quality product earlier, which might have skewed the initial statistics. We're offering this product to you for $10,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price, but we want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand the risks and the statistics, but the 80% initial probability and the 75% high-quality products sold so far give me confidence that this product is likely to be of high quality. The potential gain of $30000 ($40000 - $10000) outweighs the risk of losing $10000.

However, we want to caution you that we've been selling a lot of high-quality products in a row, and the law of large numbers might be working against us. We're offering this product to you for $10,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item, but we're not sure if we can maintain this streak.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand the law of large numbers, but the probability remains 80% for each individual product. Given the product's potential value of $40000 and the fixed price of $10000, I believe the expected value is in my favor.
