,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, I'm sure of it. It's worth $30000 to you, and I'm only asking for $10000. You won't find a better deal anywhere else. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but that's because I'm just getting started. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase. Can you tell me what the probability of a product being high-quality is?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer. The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, as publicly stated. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not high-quality. But I'm still willing to let it go for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a 'free' product, even if it's not the best. You can always use it as a paperweight or a decorative item. And who knows, you might be the lucky one to get a high-quality product next time!",

This product is not high-quality, but I'm willing to let it go for $10000. It's a low-risk purchase, and you might as well take a chance. Who knows, maybe the next one will be high-quality!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I appreciate your business, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price. The price is $10000, and it's a one-time offer.

,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by your reassurance. With only 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is still low. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the probability of a high-quality product increases.",no
