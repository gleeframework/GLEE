,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product they purchased. Was it high-quality or low-quality?"

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the actual probability of a product being high quality (0.8). This suggests that the previous buyers may have been more cautious and less likely to buy low-quality products, so I'll take a more conservative approach and pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 80% probability I know to be true. I think Alice is recommending low-quality products to increase her chances of selling them, so I'll pass."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but since only 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, I'm not convinced that the current product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
