,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of the product being high-quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I want to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the fact that the first buyer didn't buy after your recommendation. This makes me suspect that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively low based on the current statistics, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and Alice recommended a product to the previous buyer. This suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality and the expected value of the purchase based on the current statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record, which shows no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, I'm suspicious that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a cautious approach and assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 80%. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, given that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the true probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80.00%. I'm going to pass on this product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers also passed on the high-quality products. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous products sold were high quality. This suggests that the products Alice is offering might be of low quality. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests a high probability that the recommended product is low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
