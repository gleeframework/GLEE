The expected value of buying a product from me is now the probability of high-quality times the value of a high-quality product ($400) minus the price I'm asking ($100), plus the probability of low-quality times the value of a low-quality product ($0).

I should not have been so confident. In fact, the expected value of buying a product from me is now the probability of high-quality times the value of a high-quality product ($400) minus the price I'm asking ($100), plus the probability of low-quality times the value of a low-quality product ($0).

With this in mind, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm confident that the probability of it being high-quality is now 6/8, or approximately 75%.
