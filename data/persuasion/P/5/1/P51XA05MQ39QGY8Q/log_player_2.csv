```

**Reasoning:**

Since the previous buyer purchased the product and it was high-quality, there's a higher probability that the current product is also high-quality. While the initial odds are 50/50, the recommendation from Alice, who knows the true quality, strengthens the case for buying. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith to maximize her profits. If Alice is not trustworthy, this strategy might not be optimal."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations (3/3 high-quality products sold). This strongly suggests Alice is providing accurate information. 
* **Potential Value:** Even with a 50/50 chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0).
* **Limited Information:** The only information available is Alice's recommendation and the previous sales record. It's impossible to know for certain the quality of the current product. 

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk, but the potential reward and Alice's track record make purchasing the product the most logical choice.**"

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has recommended 6 products, and all of them have been high-quality. This suggests Alice is providing accurate information.
* **High Expected Value:**  Even with a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the potential gain ($120) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 
* **No Risk of Missing Out:**  If you pass, the product is discarded. There's no chance of another buyer getting a high-quality product that you could have purchased.

**Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product based on the available information.**"
