Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're trying to sell products at a fixed price of $10,000, it makes sense to recommend Bob to buy a high-quality product.  Even though you don't know the exact value to Bob, there's a 50% chance the product is worth more than $10,000 to him.  This creates a potential for profit for both you and Bob."

```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Since you don't know Bob's valuation of a low-quality product, there's a good chance that he will not value it at $10,000. Therefore, it's best to not recommend buying the product this round to avoid a potential loss."

```

**Explanation:**

As you don't know his valuation of low-quality products, there's a high risk he'll be disappointed and won't see the value in the $10,000 price tag. It's best to avoid the risk and not recommend the purchase this round."
