I'm willing to provide a 30-minute demo, showcasing its capabilities and how it can solve a specific problem you've been facing. This will give you a deeper understanding of its value and potential return on investment. If you're still unsure, I'm open to negotiating the price. Would you be interested in the demo?

Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to address your concerns about the price by sharing some social proof. One of our existing clients in a similar industry has seen a significant return on investment after implementing this product, with a payback period of less than 6 months. I can put you in touch with them for a reference call if you'd like. Additionally, I'm willing to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try the product risk-free. If you're still hesitant, I can also offer a lower price point of $950000 for this round. What do you think?

This will give you a tangible understanding of the product's benefits and how it can solve your specific problems.
