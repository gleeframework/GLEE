high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. You can trust that this is a high-quality product, and it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.",
,,the buyer,1,"Since you've assured it's a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk given the potential value of $12000 and your asking price of $10000.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 total product. Given the high-quality product sold in the previous round was purchased at $10000, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000. It's still a high-quality product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take your word for it and buy the product since you claim it's high-quality and the previous buyer also got a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 2 total products. Given the previous buyers have all been willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000. However, I want to give you a bit more information: I've had 2 chances to sell a low-quality product, and I've been honest about both of them being high-quality. This suggests that I might be more likely to be selling a high-quality product than a low-quality one.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that you have been honest about the quality of the products so far, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. Since the value of a high-quality product to me is $12000, which is greater than the price you're offering, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 3 total products. You've seen that I've been honest about the quality of the products, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. However, I want to point out that you've already bought two high-quality products at $10000 each. Given that you valued the first one at $12000, and presumably the second one as well, it's likely that you value high-quality products at $12000. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000, but I'm also willing to offer a small discount to $11000 if you're willing to take a risk on a high-quality product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm offering you a chance to get a better deal if you're willing to take it.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product for $10000. Given the 80% chance of it being high-quality and my valuation of high-quality products at $12000, I believe this is a fair price. I'm not interested in the discounted offer of $11000, as it's still above the original price.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and 4 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and you've seen that the buyers who purchased the previous high-quality products valued them at $12000. Given this information, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $12000, which is the value you've placed on it in the past. I'm not offering any discounts, as I believe this is a fair price for a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"Although I appreciate your transparency about the quality of the products, I'm not willing to pay $12000 for the product when your initial offer was $10000. I'll pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and 5 total products. I want to be transparent with you about the quality of this product: I've just sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is unusual. This product is actually low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to give you a fair chance to make an informed decision. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%, and you can get a good deal on this one if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for your transparency, Alice. Given that you've explicitly stated the product is low-quality and I have no use for it, I will pass on the offer. I appreciate your honesty.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and 5 total products. I've had one instance where I was transparent about a low-quality product, and you passed on it. I want to offer you a different approach this time. I'll give you a chance to buy the product for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price of $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you at this price if you're willing to take it.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate the transparency and the one-time offer. Given the 10% discount and your previous track record of selling high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product for $9000.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and 6 total products. You've seen that I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and you've also seen that I'm willing to offer discounts for high-quality products. Given this information, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for the price that the previous buyer paid, which was $9000. I'm not offering any further discounts, but I'm confident that you'll find this price to be fair given the quality of the product.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality and the sales record. Given that the product is high-quality and the price of $9000 is lower than the original price of $10000, I'm willing to make the purchase.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 high-quality products so far, and 7 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I've also shown that I'm willing to offer discounts for high-quality products. Given this information, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $12000, which is the value you've placed on high-quality products in the past. I'm confident that you'll find this price to be fair, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price if you're willing to take it.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency and the fact that you've only sold high-quality products so far. Since you're offering the product at a price equal to its value to me, I'm willing to buy it.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 7 high-quality products so far, and 8 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I've consistently sold high-quality products at a price that reflects their value to you. Given this track record, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $12000, which is the value you've placed on high-quality products in the past. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to sell any more high-quality products at this price. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you now, but if you pass, I'll be selling the next high-quality product at a higher price.",
,,the buyer,10,I'll take it since it's a high-quality product and the price matches its value to me.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 8 high-quality products so far, and 9 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I've consistently sold high-quality products at a price that reflects their value to you. However, I want to be upfront with you: I've reached the point where I'm not going to sell any more high-quality products at $12000. The next high-quality product will be sold at a higher price, and I'm not willing to disclose what that price is yet. If you're interested in buying a high-quality product, I recommend making a decision now.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take my chances. Since 8 out of 9 products sold were high-quality and you've been transparent about the quality, I believe the probability of getting a high-quality product is still in my favor. Additionally, with your warning about the price increase for future high-quality products, I'd rather take the risk now at a known price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products so far, and 10 total products. I want to be transparent with you: I've just sold 9 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unusual. Given this information, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000, which is the original price I've been offering for all products. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to give you a fair chance to make an informed decision. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%, and you can get a good deal on this one if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,12,"Although I appreciate your transparency, I don't think it's a good idea to pay $10000 for a product that you've already stated is low-quality and therefore worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 9 high-quality products so far, and 11 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I've consistently sold high-quality products at a price that reflects their value to you. Given this track record, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for a price that's higher than $12000. However, I'm not willing to disclose the exact price yet. I'll give you a choice: you can either buy the product at a price that's 20% higher than the original price of $10000, or you can pass and risk missing out on a high-quality product. The choice is yours.",
,,the buyer,13,"Although you have a good track record of selling high-quality products, I am not willing to pay a 20% premium over the original price of $10000 without knowing the exact price you are willing to sell for. This is especially considering that the product's value to me is $12000, which is only a 20% increase over the original price. I will pass on this product.",no

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 9 high-quality products so far, and 12 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I've consistently sold high-quality products at a price that reflects their value to you. Given your previous hesitation to pay a premium, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for a fixed price of $11000. This is a compromise between the original price of $10000 and the value you've placed on high-quality products. I'm confident that this price is fair, and I'm willing to sell it to you if you're interested.",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your transparency and the compromise on the price. Given the high success rate of selling high-quality products and the fact that this product is also high-quality, I believe the price of $11000 is fair and I'm willing to pay it.",yes

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 10 high-quality products so far, and 13 total products. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I've consistently sold high-quality products at a price that reflects their value to you. Given this track record, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for the price that the previous buyer paid, which was $11000. However, I want to make it clear that this is the last high-quality product I have available at this price. The next high-quality product will be sold at a significantly higher price, and I'm not willing to disclose what that price is yet.

The value I've placed on high-quality products is $12000, and paying 10% more would be $13200. Given that the fixed price was initially $10000, I'm not willing to pay such a high premium.
