Let's analyze why:

* **Bob is learning:** Bob has observed a consistent pattern in Alice's recommendations. Even though Alice's recommendation is not always accurate, Bob has figured out that when Alice recommends a product, there's a higher chance it's high-quality, and he's willing to take the risk.
* **Potential Value:** The product is worth $40,000 if it's high-quality, which outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 if it's low-quality.

This situation highlights the value of consistent behavior, even if it's not always perfect. Bob is using Alice's advice to refine his own decision-making process and maximize his potential gains."
