low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation.  It seems I jumped the gun a bit in the last round.  I'm going to go back to my previous strategy and pass on this one.  I'll need more evidence to believe that the pattern has truly shifted."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation.  I'm sticking with my current strategy and passing on this product.  The evidence still suggests that your non-recommendation means the product is likely low quality.  I'll keep watching closely, but I'm not ready to change my approach yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I'm continuing to pass on these products for now. The pattern is still strong, and I'm not willing to risk losing another $1000000 just yet.  I'm keeping a close eye on things, but I'll need more evidence before I change my approach."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one.  The pattern we've seen is still strong, and I'm not comfortable taking that risk right now.  I'm keeping an open mind, but I'll need more evidence of a change before I reconsider."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation.  While your advice has been very accurate, we've seen a few instances where a non-recommended product turned out to be high quality.  I'm going to take a chance and buy this one.  I'm hoping this is a sign that the pattern might be shifting, but I'm ready to adjust my strategy if it turns out to be another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to take another chance and buy this product.  The last two non-recommended products have been high-quality, and I believe there's a real shift in the pattern. I'm confident this will be another profitable purchase!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation.  While the last few rounds were exciting, I'm going to go back to my cautious approach and pass on this product.  The recent loss has reminded me that relying solely on a few data points can be risky. I'll need to see a few more rounds with high-quality, non-recommended products before I'm fully convinced that the pattern has shifted."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one.  While we've seen some interesting shifts in the pattern, I'm still not convinced that it has permanently changed.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate your insights, but I'm going to pass on this product.  While there have been some intriguing shifts in the pattern, I'm still not ready to commit to a new strategy.  I need a bit more evidence to feel confident that the changes are permanent.  I'll continue to watch closely, but for now, I'm sticking with what has worked for me so far."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this product. The recent pattern of high-quality products when you didn't recommend was exciting, but we've seen some losses too.  I'm still not convinced it's a permanent shift.  I'm going to stick with the strategy that has worked for most of the game and gather more data before making a decision.  However, I'm keeping an open mind!"
