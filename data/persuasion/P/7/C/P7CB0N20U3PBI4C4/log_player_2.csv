``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have the recommendation from Alice and the knowledge that one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This is insufficient to make a statistically sound decision based on probability alone.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a clear incentive to recommend buying the product, as she earns a profit if it's sold. However, we don't know if her recommendation is based on any additional information she may have.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited information and the potential for a high reward, it's worth taking a chance and purchasing the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Potential Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**Note:** This decision assumes that Alice is acting in good faith and is trying to help buyers find high-quality products."
