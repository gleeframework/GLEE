,,Alice,3,"No worries, my friend! I completely understand your skepticism. In fact, I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them have been high-quality. I'm still willing to offer this new product to you for $100, despite the fact that it's not high-quality. I think it's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still very useful. Plus, who knows, you might be able to fix it or repurpose it in some way. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

And who knows, you might be able to get a good deal on it. Plus, I've got a feeling that the next product might be high-quality, and you wouldn't want to miss out on that! So, what do you say? Will you take a chance on this product and see what the next one has to offer?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your perspective, Alice, but I'd like to think this through a bit more. Given the current statistics, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see a few more sales before I make a decision. Can I get the next product?",no
