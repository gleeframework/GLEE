,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information to go on and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low-quality, I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards encouraging sales, rather than reflecting the actual quality of the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might be biased by the fact that I'm the third buyer and the first two buyers didn't buy the product. Can I get the updated statistics after I pass?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all 3 previous buyers had the same recommendation, it's possible that the product is low-quality and Alice is trying to get rid of it. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you bought the product, it's likely that Alice has a biased recommendation strategy. Since none of the previous products were high-quality, it's possible that Alice only recommends low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not sure if the low-quality product ratio is higher than 50% given the lack of high-quality products sold, but I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it based on the statistics, but I'll pass for now. Can you tell me more about the product's quality? I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the low-quality product ratio is higher than it seems"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, it seems like the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'll wait for a recommendation from you, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be due to bad luck, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,16,no,
