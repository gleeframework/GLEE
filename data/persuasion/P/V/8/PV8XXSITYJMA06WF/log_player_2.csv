**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal. 
* **The statistics:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that the product offered to you is likely also high quality.
* **The value:** Even if the product is low quality, it costs $100. But a high-quality product is worth $125. The potential reward outweighs the risk.

**Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product.**"
