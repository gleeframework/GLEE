,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to know what Alice's recommendation is based on. Is it a simple 'yes' or 'no' recommendation, or is it based on a probability?"

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%, since only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the odds of it being high-quality are not in my favor based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products sold, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see if you can provide more information about the previous sales, such as the total number of products offered and the number of high-quality products sold out of those offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, I want to see if I can get a better recommendation or more information before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the product being low-quality is still relatively high. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold is a relatively low proportion. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
