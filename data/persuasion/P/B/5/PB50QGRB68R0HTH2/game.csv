low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, especially since you're not recommending it. Can you give me more information about the product?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the second buyer, and she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product quickly. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced based on the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision before making a decision on the next product.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool might be lower than the 80% chance I was initially told. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I want to take advantage of the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $40000 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers also passed on the high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendations."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is very low. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you provide the number of total products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers also passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she has a strong incentive to sell the low-quality products. Given the statistics, it seems like all the products sold so far are low-quality, which is consistent with the 20% chance of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if you can provide more information or if another buyer can provide a different recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality, which doesn't justify the $10000 price tag. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
