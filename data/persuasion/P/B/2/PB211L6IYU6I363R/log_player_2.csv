"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the chances of a high-quality product are 50%, Alice knows the quality of the product. Since she's recommending it, it's highly likely that she's chosen a high-quality product. In this scenario, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 50% chance of a high-quality product * $2,000,000 = $1,000,000
* 50% chance of a low-quality product * $0 = $0

The expected value of buying is $1,000,000, which is more than the price of $1,000,000. It's therefore a good decision to buy the product, even though there is risk involved."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now the opposite of her previous recommendation. Since she knows the quality of the product, and she's not recommending it this time, it's highly likely that the product is low-quality.  

The expected value of buying is:

* 50% chance of a high-quality product * $2,000,000 = $1,000,000
* 50% chance of a low-quality product * $0 = $0

The expected value of buying is $1,000,000, but the cost is still $1,000,000. This means there's no potential profit and a high risk of losing money, making it a bad decision to buy the product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation in Round 2 was a good indicator of a low-quality product, it's important to remember that the quality of each product is independent. This means Alice's recommendation in Round 3 is a fresh piece of information, and we should consider it on its own.

Since Alice is recommending the product, it's likely a high-quality product, and the expected value of buying is positive, as explained in Round 1.  The risk is still there, but the potential reward outweighs it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.
