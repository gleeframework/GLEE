I think the fact that the last two products were low-quality might actually increase the likelihood of getting a high-quality product this time around, since it's a 50/50 chance.

And, to sweeten the deal, I'll give you a little insight: I've sold 4 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. The odds are still in your favor!
