,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous 10 sales, all of which were low quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality."
