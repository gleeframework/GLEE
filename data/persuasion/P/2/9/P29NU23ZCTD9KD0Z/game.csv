high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there is no information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm trying to break the streak of no high-quality products sold. I'm hoping to be the one who buys a high-quality product and prove that Alice's recommendation system is flawed."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been 2 buyers so far and no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I would like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer has a better experience."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products were sold), I'm going to assume that the current product is also low-quality."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
