high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 80% and the probability of it being low quality is 20%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase and there's a 20% chance it could be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This is suspiciously high. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I think there's a good chance it's a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, so I'm expecting a higher success rate. I'll wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is lower than the expected 0.8. This suggests that the proportion of low-quality products may be higher than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, I suspect that the previous buyers were likely given high-quality products. If that's the case, the probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 buyers purchased the product, and only 1 high-quality product was sold. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still relatively high, but I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is significantly higher than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I think your previous buyers' decisions might be biased towards buying high-quality products, but I'm not sure if the product I'm being offered is high-quality. I'd like to see a few more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since the previous buyers have a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product and only 1 out of 3 buyers chose to buy the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
