,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, but I'd like to propose a compromise. Since you're looking for a fair price, I'll meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1200000.

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement again! With two high-quality products sold at $1000000 and $1100000, I'm starting to think you might be willing to pay a premium for these products.

I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying anything at all. I'll make one last offer on this low-quality product: I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - free.
