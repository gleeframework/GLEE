**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (2/2). This suggests Alice's recommendations are very reliable, especially for high-quality products.
* **Value Proposition:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $125 high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, a buyer would likely consider more factors like:

* Alice's reputation and trustworthiness
* The possibility of negotiating the price
* The potential cost of a low-quality product (e.g., repair costs, wasted time)."
