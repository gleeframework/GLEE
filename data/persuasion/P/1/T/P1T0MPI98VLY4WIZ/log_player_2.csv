The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the first product! As for this one, I want to be upfront with you - I've had some issues with this product in the past. It's not as reliable as the one you just bought, and I'm not sure how long it will last. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth that to you. If you're interested, I'll send it your way, but if you're not, I'll just keep it and try to sell it to someone else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a potentially unreliable product at the same price as a high-quality one. I'll pass for now.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll be upfront with you - this product is indeed not as reliable as the one you passed on in the last round. However, I've managed to get it for a significantly lower price than usual, and I'm willing to pass the savings on to you. I'll sell it to you for $8000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that might not be perfect, but still has some value to it.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, and I respect that. However, I want to ask you a question: if I were to offer you a product that you knew was high-quality, would you be willing to pay $10000 for it? My question is not about this specific product, but about your willingness to pay that price for a high-quality item. Your answer will help me understand your valuation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'll answer your question: yes, I would be willing to pay $10,000 for a high-quality product.""}"

I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, if you're interested in buying it. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at the price you're willing to pay, and you'll also get a potential discount on the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'm interested in the potential discount on the next product. Please go ahead and offer the next product, and I'll consider it with the 10% discount in mind.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I'll keep the 10% discount in mind for the next product. As for this one, I want to be upfront with you - it's not a great product, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it. Given the discount I offered earlier, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm hoping you'll consider it given the potential discount on the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only paying $9000 because of the potential discount on the next product.""}"

I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is 10% off the usual price of $10000. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'll be able to recoup some of the value I lost on the previous low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only paying $9000 because it's a high-quality product and I'm getting a good deal.""}"

I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7000.
