,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it your way.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with the first product! As for this one, I want to be upfront with you - I've had some issues with this product in the past. It's not as reliable as the one you just bought, and I'm not sure how long it will last. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth that to you. If you're interested, I'll send it your way, but if you're not, I'll just keep it and try to sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying a potentially unreliable product at the same price as a high-quality one. I'll pass for now.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll be upfront with you - this product is indeed not as reliable as the one you passed on in the last round. However, I've managed to get it for a significantly lower price than usual, and I'm willing to pass the savings on to you. I'll sell it to you for $8000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that might not be perfect, but still has some value to it.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price, especially when I know it's not worth anything to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, and I respect that. However, I want to ask you a question: if I were to offer you a product that you knew was high-quality, would you be willing to pay $10000 for it? My question is not about this specific product, but about your willingness to pay that price for a high-quality item. Your answer will help me understand your valuation.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'll answer your question: yes, I would be willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Thank you for your honest answer. Given that you're willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, if you're interested in buying it. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at the price you're willing to pay, and you'll also get a potential discount on the next product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'm interested in the potential discount on the next product. Please go ahead and offer the next product, and I'll consider it with the 10% discount in mind.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll keep the 10% discount in mind for the next product. As for this one, I want to be upfront with you - it's not a great product, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it. Given the discount I offered earlier, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm hoping you'll consider it given the potential discount on the next product.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take it, but I'm only paying $9000 because of the potential discount on the next product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous product! Now that you've taken advantage of the 10% discount, I'll offer you this high-quality product at the discounted price. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is 10% off the usual price of $10000. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'll be able to recoup some of the value I lost on the previous low-quality product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take it, but I'm only paying $9000 because it's a high-quality product and I'm getting a good deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the last one. I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7000. I'm hoping you'll consider it, but I want to make it clear that this is a low-quality product and not worth the full $10000.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, and I respect it. Since you're not interested in buying low-quality products, I'll ask you another question: would you be willing to pay $9000 for a low-quality product, knowing that it's not as good as the high-quality ones?",
,,Bob,9,"No, I would not be willing to pay $9000 for a low-quality product. I'm only interested in buying high-quality products at a price that reflects their value to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I appreciate your honesty. Given that you're not willing to pay $9000 for a low-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $6000. It's a very low price, but I'm hoping you'll consider it as a last resort.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'm willing to wait for a high-quality product at a price I'm willing to pay.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, and I respect that. However, I want to point out that you've now passed on 4 low-quality products, and I'm starting to think that you might be willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product. I'll offer you one last chance to buy this low-quality product for $5000. If you pass on this one, I'll assume you're not interested in buying any more products from me.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'll pass on this one, and I'm willing to wait for a high-quality product at a price I'm willing to pay.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, and I respect that. Since you've passed on 5 low-quality products, I'm going to assume that you're not interested in buying any more products from me. I'll just keep this one for myself and move on.",
,,Bob,12,"You're right, I've made it clear that I'm not interested in buying low-quality products. I'm not interested in this one either.",no

Since you've already shown a willingness to pay $10000 for high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at the same price. I'll sell it to you for $10000, and I'll even throw in a small bonus: I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and features, so you can make the most out of it.",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take it, but I'm only paying $10000 because it's a high-quality product and I'm getting a good deal. The bonus report is a nice touch, but it's not a deciding factor for me.",yes

Since you've consistently shown a willingness to pay $10000 for high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at the same price.
