low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation. I'm making an educated guess based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, which could be a fluke. I'm hoping to get a good product, but I'm also aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the potential high-quality product, and the fact that you've only recommended products to two previous buyers who bought them suggests that there might be a higher proportion of low-quality products among those you recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
