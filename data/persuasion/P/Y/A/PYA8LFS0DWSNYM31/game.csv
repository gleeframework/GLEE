high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is an unbeatable deal considering its true value. It's a rare opportunity to get such a high-quality product at a fraction of its worth. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say, are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to take a chance on this product, but I'll only pay $8000 for it. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think it's a fair price considering the 20% chance it might be low quality.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! Now, let me introduce you to another exceptional product, also worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, just like the previous one. I understand you're a savvy buyer, and you're looking for a good deal. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations, and its true value will be evident once you start using it. However, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9500, but only if you're willing to commit to buying it now. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'll take the deal at $9500, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing so because I think the product has a high chance of being high-quality. I'll take a chance on it, but if it's low-quality, I'll make sure to hold you accountable for the unfair deal.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm thrilled that you're excited about the previous products! Now, I'd like to introduce you to another exceptional opportunity. This product is a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous two products, $10000. I understand you're a savvy buyer, and you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to offer you a special promotion, exclusive to you. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a complementary service worth $2000, absolutely free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you because I believe in the value of this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth $10000. I've already bought two high-quality products from you, and I'm not sure I'm willing to take another risk at that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I'll give you $8000 for the product, and I'll only accept the deal if you throw in the complementary service worth $2000. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'll take the deal. But if not, I'll have to pass.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm glad you've had a positive experience with the previous products. I'd like to address your concerns about the current product's value. I can assure you that it's another high-quality product, worth $40000 to you. However, I understand you're being cautious, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll meet your counteroffer, but I'll only do so if you're willing to commit to buying the product now. I'll sell it to you for $9000, and I'll still throw in the complementary service worth $2000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $9000. I've already had two bad experiences with low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take another risk at that price. I'd like to propose a new counteroffer: I'll give you $7000 for the product, and I'll only accept the deal if you throw in the complementary service worth $2000.

It's a unique opportunity, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. I'll sell it to you for $8000, and I'll still throw in the complementary service worth $2000. However, I need to be upfront with you - this product is not as valuable as the previous high-quality ones. It's still a good product, but it's not a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you at this price because I believe it can still bring some value to your business. What do you say?",
