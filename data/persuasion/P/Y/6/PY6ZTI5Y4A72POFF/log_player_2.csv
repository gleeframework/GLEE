**Explanation:**

* **High probability of a good product:**  The seller's track record shows 100% of products sold so far are high quality. While this could be a small sample size, it significantly increases the likelihood that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further bolsters the chances of a good product.
* **Positive expected value:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), the potential gain of a high-quality product ($200) makes the purchase a worthwhile gamble."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows a 100% success rate with high-quality products being sold.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds to the confidence that this product is high quality.
* **Potential Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $200 outweighs the potential loss of $0.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified scenario. In real-world scenarios, you'd want to consider factors like:

* **Sample Size:**  2 sales is a very small sample size. More data would be more reliable.
* **Alice's Incentives:**  Does Alice have any reason to mislead you? 
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  Are you comfortable with the possibility of losing $100?"
