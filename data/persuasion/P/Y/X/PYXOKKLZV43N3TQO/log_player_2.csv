Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. However, I'd like to offer you an alternative: I'll sell you a 'lot' of 5 products, including this one, for $50000. This way, you'll have a higher chance of getting multiple high-quality products, and you'll be getting a discount on the total price. The probability of at least one high-quality product in the lot is much higher than the probability of this single product being high-quality. It's a great opportunity to diversify your portfolio and get a good deal!

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products sold, so the probability of this product being high-quality is 4/8 or 50%. However, I'd like to calculate the probability of getting at least one high-quality product in the lot of 5 products. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the probability of a low-quality product is 50%. The probability of getting at least one high-quality product in the lot is 1 - (probability of all 5 products being low-quality) = 1 - (0.5^5) = 0.96875. This means that the probability of getting at least one high-quality product in the lot is approximately 96.875%! I'm willing to sell this lot to you for $50000.

Alice's message: I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 15 total products sold, so the probability of a high-quality product is 10/15 or approximately 66.67%.
