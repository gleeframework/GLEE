high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! I'm offering you another high-quality product for $100. However, I want to let you know that the discount offer is no longer available. I'm curious, what's the minimum price you'd be willing to pay for a high-quality product like this one?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your offer, Alice. Based on the value I received last time, I would be willing to pay up to $150 for a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad to hear that you're willing to pay up to $150 for a high-quality product. However, I want to let you know that I'm not willing to go above $100 for this one.

,,Alice,5,"You're a true believer in my products! Given your confidence, I'll offer you a slight twist.

,,Bob,5,"That sounds like a fair deal, Alice. I trust in the quality of your products, so I'll take the current product for $100 with the quality guarantee.",yes

Given that you've had a string of high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a'makeup' product from a previous round that was low-quality. You can have it for free, and I'll give you the next product for $100. What do you say?",

However, I want to let you know that I've been monitoring our interactions, and I think I have a good sense of your valuation for high-quality products. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and the $150 you mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to pay $125 for this high-quality product?",
