"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, I would not recommend buying the product. Here's why:

* **Unknown Quality:**  You have no information about the specific product's quality except for your statement that it is high-quality. However, there's no way to verify this claim.
* **High Risk:** The price of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than the potential value of a high-quality product ($2,000,000). If the product turns out to be low-quality (which is a possibility), the buyer loses their entire investment. 
* **No Guarantee:** There are no guarantees or refunds offered, making the purchase even riskier.

**In short, the potential reward is not high enough to justify the risk of purchasing a product of unknown quality at a high price.**"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, since I'm the first one and there's no prior information to go by.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the product in this round is high-quality, the buyer should still not recommend purchasing it.  Here's why:

* **No Credibility:** The seller has no track record of selling high-quality products. The previous buyer's purchase does not establish trust because the seller could have simply been lucky with the first product.
* **High Risk Remains:**  The high price and the lack of guarantees still pose a significant risk. Even if the seller were to sell a high-quality product in this round, there's no guarantee they will continue to do so in the future.

The buyer needs more evidence of the seller's reliability and a track record of selling high-quality products before taking the risk."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer should still not recommend purchasing the product. Here's why:

* **No Track Record:** The seller has still not proven their reliability. Two rounds have passed, and they have only sold one product, which could have been a lucky break.
* **Lack of Trust:** The buyer has shown hesitation in the past two rounds, indicating a lack of trust in the seller. This hesitation is justified due to the seller's lack of a track record and the high risk associated with the purchase.
* **High Risk Remains:**  The high price and the absence of guarantees continue to make the purchase risky.

The buyer needs more convincing evidence that the seller is trustworthy and consistently sells high-quality products before considering a purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, I'd like to wait and see how the next buyer reacts.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **High Risk:** The price and the lack of guarantees make this purchase extremely risky.  
* **Low Quality:** The buyer knows the product is low-quality. There is no chance of recovering the investment.
