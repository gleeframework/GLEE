,,Alice,2,"This product is a rare find, with unique features that are highly sought after. I believe it has the potential to generate significant returns. While the price might seem high, the value it offers justifies the investment.",

,,Bob,4,"Alice, I'm starting to get the impression that you're more interested in selling me something rather than ensuring I get a good deal.  I need to see more than just fancy words.

,,Bob,5,"Alice, your continued insistence on the price without offering any proof or guarantees is concerning.

Perhaps you could offer a refund guarantee or some independent verification of the product's quality.",no

,,Bob,11,"Alice, while the 50% refund is better than nothing, it still doesn't fully address my concerns. I'm not comfortable taking a 50% loss on a potential $1000000 investment.
