high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the first buyer also passed and there's no evidence of a high-quality product being sold yet. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer also bought it and it was low quality, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, it seems that she has been recommending low-quality products, which is unusual given the 50/50 split of high/low quality. I'm skeptical of her recommendation and will pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 50%, which would make the expected value of buying the product negative. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a future product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and see if I get a high-quality product."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product or gather more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be higher than 50%."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and given the high probability of low-quality products, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice, which suggests a higher probability of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you're not recommending me to buy it, I'm assuming the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 out of 5 products were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I will pass on the product."
