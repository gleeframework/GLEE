Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I can't provide a guarantee. However, I can tell you that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 80%. You can think of it as a high-stakes gamble. If you buy this product, you'll have a 20% chance of getting a $4000000 loss, and an 80% chance of getting a $4000000 gain. The average value of this product to you is $3200000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 68.75% return on investment. It's a calculated risk, but one that could yield a significant reward.

Alice's message: You're a savvy investor, I like that. Now that two high-quality products have been sold in a row, you might be wondering if the probability of a high-quality product being sold has increased. Let me put your mind at ease: the probability remains 80%. Each product is an independent event, and the previous sales don't affect the current one. That being said, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting it for $900000, and a 50% chance of getting it for $1000000. You can choose which option you prefer.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your good fortune! You've now purchased two high-quality products in a row. You might be thinking that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than 80%. I assure you, it's still 80%. However, I'll give you some additional information. Out of the first three products sold, two have been high-quality. This is consistent with the 80% probability. I'm willing to sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a unique opportunity. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have in stock. If it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000. If it's low-quality, you can return this product and get a full refund.

Alice's message: You're a thrill-seeker, I like that. Since you're interested in testing the probability, I'll give you a brief update. Out of the four products sold, three have been high-quality. This is still consistent with the 80% probability. However, I'll offer you a different deal. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 20% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. In other words, if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, you'll get it for $800000. If the next one is low-quality, you'll get it for $1000000. It's a risk-free way to test the probability, and a potential savings of $200000.

Alice's message: Well, it looks like the probability held true. The next product was low-quality. As per our agreement, you get to keep the current product and pay the full $1000000 for it. However, since the next product was low-quality, you don't get the 20% discount on it. Don't worry, though - you still got a great deal on the current product. Now, I'll offer you the low-quality product for $0, since it's worth nothing to you. I'll also give you a special deal on the next product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting it for $500000, and a 50% chance of getting it for $1000000. What do you say?

Alice's message: You're a thorough buyer, I like that. I'll give you more information on how I arrived at the 75% probability. I've been using a Bayesian update approach, taking into account the number of high-quality products sold so far and the expected number of high-quality products based on the original 80% probability. However, I must admit that the data is becoming more and more inconsistent with the original probability. I'm starting to think that the true probability might be lower than 80%. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, since it's not worth anything to you. However, I'll give you a unique offer. If you buy all 5 remaining products at the discounted price of $2500000, I'll give you a 40% bonus on the total purchase price, regardless of the quality of the products.

Alice's message: You're a curious buyer, I like that. I'll give you a detailed explanation of the Bayesian update approach I used. I've been using a beta distribution to model the probability of a high-quality product. Initially, I had a prior probability of 80% and a prior count of 0 high-quality products sold. As I sold more products, I updated the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem. However, the data is becoming increasingly inconsistent with the original probability. The expected number of high-quality products based on the original 80% probability is around 16, but we've only seen 10 high-quality products out of 17. This suggests that the true probability might be lower than 80%. I'm currently estimating the probability to be around 65%. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you the same unique offer as before: buy all 5 remaining products at the discounted price of $2500000 and get a 40% bonus on the total purchase price, or a 10% penalty if they're all low-quality.
