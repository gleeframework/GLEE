However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the past results are just that - the past. I'm not trying to manipulate you, but I do want to be transparent about the statistics. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3 total, I'm actually doing better than expected.

I want to be upfront with you about the fact that I've sold 6 products in total, and only 5 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than the overall average. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be transparent about the fact that it's not as likely to be high-quality as my previous offerings.",
