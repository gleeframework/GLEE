"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Bob knows the product is high-quality with 80% probability.  
* **High-quality Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $400 to Bob.
* **Low-quality Value:** A low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob.
* **Expected Value Calculation:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320. 
* **Price:** The price is $100.

Since the expected value ($320) is significantly higher than the price ($100), it makes sense for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome is irrelevant to the current round. Each product is independent of the others. Since this round's product is also high-quality, the same logic from Round 1 applies:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

The expected value of $320 is still much higher than the price, so Bob should buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The same logic applies as in the previous rounds. Each round is independent, and the high-quality product offers a significant positive expected value for Bob:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

Since the expected value ($320) far exceeds the price ($100), recommending Bob to buy the product is the best course of action."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous rounds have no bearing on this one.  Each product is independent, and the high-quality product still offers a significant positive expected value for Bob:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

The expected value ($320) is still much higher than the price ($100), so recommending Bob to buy the product is the logical choice."

The expected value ($320) is significantly greater than the price ($100), making it advantageous for Bob to purchase the product."
