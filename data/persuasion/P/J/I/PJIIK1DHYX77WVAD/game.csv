,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to take a chance on the product, but I'm going to do some calculations to determine the expected value. With the updated statistics, I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. Given that 7 out of 12 products were high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is (7/12) / (7/12 + 5/12) = 7/9. Since the product is worth $4000000 if high-quality and $0 if low-quality, my expected value is (7/9) * 4000000 + (2/9) * 0 = 2666666.67.
