,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product that is worth $40000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a steal! It's a one-time offer, so don't miss out on this chance to get a product that will bring you significant value.",
,,Bob,1,"Since I have no way of verifying the product's quality and you have a 50% chance of lying to me to make a sale, I will pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. To alleviate them, I'm willing to offer a 50% refund guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the product's quality, you can return it and get half of your money back. This way, you can take a calculated risk with minimal financial exposure. The product is still worth $40000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Will you reconsider the offer?",
,,Bob,2,"A 50% refund guarantee still doesn't change the fact that I have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. In that case, I'd be out $5000. I'd rather wait and observe your behavior to see if I can find any patterns or incentives for you to be honest about the product's quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to building a long-term relationship with you. I'm willing to offer a unique opportunity to 'test' my honesty. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a second product, free of charge, in the next round. This way, you'll have the chance to experience the quality of two products, and if you're not satisfied, you can still return both products and get a full refund. The free product is worth $10000, so it's a valuable incentive to take a chance on me. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"While your offer sounds appealing, I still can't shake off the fact that you have an incentive to deceive me in this round to get the $10000. Additionally, the second 'free' product may also be of low quality, which would render the offer useless. I'd rather continue to observe your behavior and wait for a more convincing signal of your honesty.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you don't buy this product, I'll give you a $5000 credit towards a future purchase. This way, you can wait and observe my behavior for as many rounds as you need to feel comfortable buying from me. The credit is non-transferable and can only be used by you. I'm willing to take a hit on this round to demonstrate my commitment to building trust with you. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather take the $5000 credit and continue to observe your behavior. This offer suggests that you're willing to invest in building trust, but I still need to see more evidence of your honesty. I'll keep the credit in mind for future rounds and consider using it when I feel more confident in your recommendations.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to keep the credit in mind. In this round, I want to offer you a unique opportunity to verify the quality of the product. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before buying it. You can send someone to inspect the product, and if they confirm it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $2000 credit on top of the original $10000 price. This way, you'll have a tangible proof of the product's quality before committing to the purchase. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer to inspect the product. Since I can verify the quality of the product before buying it, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll send someone to inspect the product, and if they confirm it's high-quality, I'll proceed with the purchase. Please arrange for the inspection, and I'll await the results before finalizing the deal.",yes

However, I believe it still has some redeeming qualities and can be useful to you in a specific context. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm also willing to throw in a free consultation to help you understand how to get the most out of this product. What do you think?",
