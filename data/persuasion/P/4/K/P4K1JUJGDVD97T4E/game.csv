,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I know it's the first sale, so I'm not influenced by any previous sales data. I'll just have to rely on the expected value of the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality. I'm making my decision based on the 2:1 ratio of low-quality to high-quality products and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that this product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to know the probability that you would have recommended it if it was high quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'll pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous products were low quality, it seems like the products Alice is recommending are likely to be low quality. I'll wait for a recommendation from Alice to buy."
