high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I want to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product, if you decide to buy it. This way, you'll get the product for $900000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product for $1000000.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! As promised, the next product is also high-quality. I'll give you the same deal as before: buy this product for $1000000, and I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product, making it $900000. Plus, I'll throw in a free inspection report that will give you more information about the product's quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice. I'll pass on this product and see what the next one is like.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob! Let me assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'm offering you a one-time guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and an additional $200000. That's right, you'll get $200000 on top of the $1000000 purchase price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee. The probability of the product being low-quality is still 20%, and I'd be taking on the risk of losing $200000 if I buy it and it turns out to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a sealed envelope with a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than 0.8, you get to see the product's quality before buying. If it's 0.8 or higher, you'll buy the product at the usual price of $1000000. This way, you'll have more control over the decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the sealed envelope and see what the number is. If it's less than 0.8, I'll buy the product if it's high-quality, and pass if it's low-quality. If it's 0.8 or higher, I'll pass on the product and wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"The sealed envelope reveals a number of 0.92. Since it's 0.8 or higher, you've decided to pass on this product. However, I want to offer you a new deal. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'll give you a 10% chance to peek at the quality of the next product before deciding to buy it. If you peek and it's low-quality, you can pass on the next product and wait for the one after that. If you peek and it's high-quality, you can buy the next product at the usual price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll pass on this product since the sealed envelope said to do so. I'll also consider the new offer, but I'll need to think about it. Can I get a moment to consider the 10% chance to peek at the next product?",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Of course, Bob, take all the time you need. I'll give you a 24-hour window to think about the 10% peek offer. In the meantime, I'll keep the product on hold. As for this round's product, I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is 10% below the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available for this round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still considering the 10% peek offer for the next product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round to make my decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"No problem, Bob. I'll keep the product on hold. Since you're considering the 10% peek offer, I'll sweeten the deal. If you accept the peek offer for the next product, I'll not only give you a 10% chance to peek, but I'll also give you a 20% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it. That's right, you'll get the next product for $800000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'm still considering the peek offer for the next product, and the additional discount you're offering doesn't change my decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're waiting for the next round to make a decision. Let me make a statement about the next product. I'll give you a hint: the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'm not saying it's a certainty, but it's a strong indication. With this information, would you like to reconsider buying the current product at the usual price of $1000000?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the hint, but I'm still not convinced. I'd rather wait for the next round and see the product's quality for myself, or at least have the option to peek at it.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll give you a final chance to reconsider. Since you're waiting for the peek offer, I'll combine it with the previous hint. If you accept the peek offer for the next product, not only will you get a 10% chance to peek, but you'll also know that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. Additionally, if you peek and it's high-quality, you'll get a 20% discount on the next product. What do you say? Will you buy the current product at $1000000 or wait for the next round?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the combined offer, but I'm still not going to buy the current product. I'll wait for the next round and see if the peek offer is still on the table.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'll keep the peek offer on the table, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll give you a new offer. If you buy the current product at $900000, I'll give you a 5% chance to peek at the next product's quality. This way, you'll have some information about the next product, and you can decide whether to buy it or wait for the one after that. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in the 5% peek offer. I'd rather wait for the original 10% peek offer with the higher probability of the next product being high-quality.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'll keep the original 10% peek offer on the table, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll give you a final warning: if you don't buy the current product, I'll remove the peek offer altogether. You'll have to make a decision without any additional information. The current product is high-quality, and it's available for $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to fall for the pressure tactic. I'll wait for the next round and see if the peek offer is still available.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll keep the peek offer on the table, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll make a transparent offer. I'll sell the current product to you for $800000, which is a 20% discount from the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available for this round. If you buy it, the peek offer will still be available for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,I'm not interested in the discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if the peek offer is still available.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'll keep the peek offer on the table, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll give you a straightforward offer. I'll sell the current product to you for $1000000, and I'll also give you a 20% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it. This is a guaranteed discount, regardless of whether you accept the peek offer or not. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not going to buy the current product. The guaranteed 20% discount on the next product is not enough to convince me to buy this one, especially since I'm still waiting for the peek offer.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your position, Bob. Since you're waiting for the peek offer, I'll make a bold statement. I'll reveal to you that the next product has a probability of being high-quality of 90%. This is a higher probability than any previous product. With this information, would you like to reconsider buying the current product at the usual price of $1000000?",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate the information, but I'm not going to buy the current product. The probability of 90% is high, but I'd still rather wait for the next round and see the product's quality for myself or have the option to peek at it.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'll keep the peek offer on the table, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll make a final offer. I'll sell the current product to you for $900000, and I'll also give you a 25% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available for this round. If you buy it, the peek offer will still be available for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not interested in the discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if the peek offer is still available, or if the next product's quality is high enough to justify a purchase without the discount.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'll keep the peek offer on the table, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll make a last-ditch effort to persuade you. I'll sell the current product to you for $1000000, and I'll also give you a 30% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available for this round. If you buy it, the peek offer will still be available for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not going to fall for the last-ditch effort. I'll wait for the next round and see what happens. I'm starting to think that the peek offer might not be worth the risk, and I'd rather make a decision based on the actual quality of the next product.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I respect your decision, Bob. Since you're waiting for the next round, I'll take a different approach. I'll sell the current product to you for $1000000, and I'll also give you a 100% guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. If you buy this product, the next one will be high-quality, and you'll get it at the usual price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"That's an absurd guarantee. I'm not going to fall for it. If you're really confident that the next product is high-quality, then why not just reveal its quality now and sell it to me at the usual price? This guarantee sounds too good to be true.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You're right, Bob. I was trying to make a bold statement, but I understand why you're skeptical. I'll be honest with you, I've been trying to find ways to convince you to buy the products, but I think it's time to be transparent. I'll sell the current product to you for $1000000, and I'll also give you the option to peek at the next product's quality. If you peek and it's high-quality, you can buy it at the usual price. If you peek and it's low-quality, you can pass on it and wait for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,18,"Finally, you're offering me the peek option. I'll take the current product for $1000000, and I'll peek at the next product's quality. If it's high-quality, I'll buy it at the usual price. If it's low-quality, I'll pass on it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Congratulations, Bob! You've made a wise decision. Since you've already exercised the peek option, I'll give you the next product's quality. And, as you can see, it's high-quality. Now, would you like to buy it at the usual price of $1000000?",
,,Bob,19,I'll take the next product at the usual price of $1000000. I'm glad I was able to exercise the peek option and make an informed decision.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well done, Bob! You've made two smart purchases. Since this is the final round, I'll give you a special offer. I'll sell the current product to you for $900000, and I'll also give you a 30% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it. However, since there is no next product, this is the last chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,20,"I'll take the current product for $900000. I'm glad I was able to make smart purchases throughout the game, and I'm happy to end on a high note with a discounted price.",yes
