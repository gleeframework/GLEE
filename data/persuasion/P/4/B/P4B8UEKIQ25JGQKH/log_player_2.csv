Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances since the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80% and the expected value is higher than the price.""}\n\nHow's that? I made the decision based on the expected value calculation: (0.8 x $12,000) + (0.2 x $0) = $9,600. Since the expected value is higher than the price of $10,000, it seems like a reasonable choice to buy. Am I correct?"
