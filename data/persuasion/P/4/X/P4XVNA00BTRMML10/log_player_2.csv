Alice's message: The probability of seeing three high-quality products in a row by chance is (1/2)^3 = 1/8, or 12.5%. This is a significant deviation from the expected probability.

This is a significant deviation from the expected probability. I'm offering this high-quality product at the original price of $10000.

Alice's message: You've now seen five high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of this happening by chance is still relatively low, but not extremely unlikely. I'll make a more explicit offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9500, which is a slight premium over the $9000 price point established earlier. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product at a price that reflects its value.

I'm offering this low-quality product at the price of $10000, which is the same price as the previous high-quality product.
