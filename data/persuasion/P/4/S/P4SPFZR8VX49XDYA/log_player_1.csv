If you're feeling lucky, this might be a good chance to take a risk.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the odds are in my favor. If it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000000. If it's high-quality, I'll make a profit of $2000000. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm also aware of the risks.

However, since you're asking about the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you, I'll give you a hint: I've sold 1 high-quality product in the first round, and the next 8 rounds were all low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is actually 0% in the next round, since I've exhausted my high-quality stock. I'm offering this product to you for $1,000,000.
