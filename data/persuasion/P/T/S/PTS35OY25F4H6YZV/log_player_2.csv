"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value is $125. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount, but only if you buy it now. If you don't buy it, the price will go up to $120 in the next round.

It's another high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll love it. But, I want to give you a hint: the next two products are likely to be low-quality. So, if you want to get a good deal on a high-quality product, this is your chance.

But, I'll give you a heads up: I've been getting a lot of interest in this product, and if you don't buy it now, I might have to sell it to someone else for a higher price. You're getting a great deal, but it's only available for you if you act now.

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your enthusiasm.

If you buy a high-quality product within the next two rounds, I'll give you a refund of the difference between the sale price and the value of the product ($125). But, if you buy a low-quality product, you'll still pay the full $100. So, this round's product is still $100, but the next two rounds will have this added incentive. What do you think?

I'll be honest with you, this is one of the best deals I've ever offered. What do you say?
