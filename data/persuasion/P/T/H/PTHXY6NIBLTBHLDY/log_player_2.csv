**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We don't have enough information to make a purely rational decision based on probability alone. We only know the historical sales data of one buyer, and that buyer purchased a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a significant factor. While she doesn't know the product's true quality, she's likely using some internal logic or pattern recognition to make recommendations. 
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential upside of getting a high-quality product ($400 value) outweighs the potential downside of getting a low-quality product ($0 value).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Given the limited information and the potential for a high reward, taking the risk is a reasonable decision."
