high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the quality of the product first and then make a decision based on the information I get from you and the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a feel for the product's quality and the game's dynamics."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only 1 out of 2 products being high-quality, the probability of the product being high-quality is 40%, which is lower than the expected 50%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I want to assure you that this product is high-quality. Although none of my previous high-quality products have been sold, I'm confident in the value this one will bring to you."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I understand previous buyers' concerns, but I assure you this product is high-quality. Consider the probability of 7 consecutive high-quality products being offered and none being sold. The odds are in your favor, as I've had 6 high-quality products in a row not being sold. Take advantage of this opportunity."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the previous sales record?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Given that I've had 7 high-quality products in a row, and none of them were sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. My previous recommendations were genuine, but buyers were cautious. This product is indeed high-quality, and I strongly recommend it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'll be transparent about the situation. I've had 8 high-quality products in a row, and none of them were sold. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. Consider the value you'll get from this product, which is $12500, and the price is $10000. I strongly recommend taking this opportunity."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is quite low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I understand your concern, but the information you're using is outdated. The 1 product sold was actually low-quality, and I didn't recommend it. Since then, I've had 8 high-quality products in a row. I assure you this product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend taking this opportunity."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I see a pattern of buyers being overly cautious due to the initial low-quality product sale. I assure you, this product is high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 80%. Don't miss out on the $2500 value above the asking price. I've had 10 high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident in this one."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards getting a sale, and I'd like to wait and see if the product quality improves or if more data becomes available."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you my recommendation is genuine. Consider the probability of 12 consecutive high-quality products being offered, and the value you'll get from this product. To alleviate concerns, I'll share that the only product sold so far was indeed low-quality, and I didn't recommend it. I've been transparent about the quality of my products. This one is high-quality, and I strongly recommend it."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, which might indicate a low-quality product was offered. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered to get a better sense of the overall quality of the products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"The previous buyer's reasoning is flawed. They assumed the last product wasn't bought because it was low-quality, but in reality, it was high-quality, just like the previous 11 products. I've been offering high-quality products consistently, and this one is no exception. Don't miss out on the opportunity to get a high-quality product worth $12500 for $10000."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I've seen that none of the previous buyer's products were high quality, and I'm not convinced that this one is any different. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I must correct the previous buyer's misconception. None of the previous buyers' decisions were based on the actual quality of the products. In fact, I've had 13 consecutive high-quality products, and none were sold. This product is also high-quality, and I strongly recommend taking advantage of the $2500 value above the asking price."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I see a pattern of buyers being overly cautious due to the lack of sales. I want to assure you that the quality of my products is genuine. To alleviate concerns, I'll share that I've had 14 consecutive high-quality products, and none were sold due to buyer skepticism, not due to the products' quality. This product is also high-quality, and I strongly recommend taking advantage of the value it offers."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that Alice knows the value of the product to me, and her recommendation is likely based on the fact that I'm the second buyer. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that my recommendation is genuine and not based on the order of buyers. The low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far is due to buyer skepticism, not the quality of the products. I've had 15 consecutive high-quality products, and none were sold. This product is also high-quality, and I strongly recommend taking advantage of the $2500 value above the asking price. Don't let the previous buyers' decisions influence your judgment."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially considering that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I want to be transparent with you. The previous buyer bought the product despite my lack of recommendation, and unfortunately, it was low-quality. This product is also low-quality, and I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that none of the previous two products were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I want to assure you that the previous two products were indeed low-quality, but this one is high-quality. Don't let the recent low-quality products influence your decision. The overall probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I've had many high-quality products in the past that weren't sold. This product is worth $12500, and I'm offering it for $10000. I strongly recommend taking advantage of this opportunity."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"This is the final round, and I want to assure you that this product is high-quality. Despite the previous buyers' skepticism, I've had many high-quality products throughout the rounds. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I strongly recommend taking advantage of this last opportunity to get a product worth $12500 for $10000."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the statistics, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
