,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, and based on the previous sales record, I'm seeing a lot of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I know Alice doesn't know my valuation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of losing $100 for a product that's not worth anything to me."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 9 products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which is worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 9, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). I'd like to see a better signal before buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 9 previous buyers who purchased the products, all of them received low-quality products, which suggests a high probability of the product being low quality.
