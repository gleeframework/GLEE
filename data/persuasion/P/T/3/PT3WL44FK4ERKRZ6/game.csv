low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You have no prior information about the quality of this product, but I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,I trust your random selection process and am willing to take the chance on the product's quality.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far, which is a 50% success rate. This is within the expected probability of 50% for a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance and buy this potentially high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,I trust the statistics and the probability. I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $100.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. This is higher than the expected probability of 50% for a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance and buy this potentially low-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, but based on the statistics provided, the success rate for high-quality products seems unusually high. I prefer to err on the side of caution and pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 so far, which is a 50% success rate, right back to the expected probability. This suggests that the previous high success rate was likely a fluke. Would you like to take a chance and buy this potentially low-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that the previous high success rate might have been a fluke, I prefer to err on the side of caution and pass on this product. I appreciate your transparency.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 so far, which is still a 40% success rate. I'm starting to think that I might have a slight bias towards selling low-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this potentially low-quality product for $100?",

,,the buyer,7,I trust the statistics and am willing to take the chance on this product.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 so far, which is a 50% success rate, right back to the expected probability. This suggests that my previous deviation was indeed a fluke. Would you like to take a chance and buy this potentially high-quality product for $100?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 10 so far, which is a 60% success rate, still above the expected probability of 50% for a high-quality product. However, I've also sold 2 low-quality products out of the last 3, which suggests that the high success rate might be due to chance. Would you like to take a chance and buy this potentially low-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your success rate and considering the risk, I am willing to take a chance and purchase the product for $100.",yes
