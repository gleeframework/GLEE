You are in a tough spot. You've recommended against three products in a row, and the buyers are likely starting to see you as untrustworthy. Recommending this high-quality product will likely not convince them, as they are likely to think you are just trying to get rid of a low-quality product."

You are in a difficult situation. You have not sold any products, and every time you recommend against a product, it strengthens the buyer's belief that all your products are low quality.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

You're in a nearly impossible situation. You've never sold a product, and every recommendation has been against a product. This has led buyers to firmly believe that all your products are low-quality. Recommending this product, even though it's high-quality, will likely be seen as a desperate attempt to sell a low-quality product.  

You need to find a new approach. This could include:

* **Lowering your price:** This might make the product more appealing to a risk-averse buyer, even if they still believe the product is low-quality.
* **Offering a warranty or guarantee:** This could build trust by assuring buyers that you stand behind your product.
* **Providing more information:** Explain the product's features in detail, and offer evidence of its quality.
* **Changing your selling strategy:** Perhaps try a different sales pitch, or target a different audience. 

Your current strategy is not working. A complete overhaul is necessary."

It is time for a radical change in your strategy. You need to take a different approach to build trust and make a sale.  Here are some suggestions:

* **Change your product:**  Consider offering something significantly cheaper or something with a much lower risk for the buyer.  
* **Offer a guarantee or warranty:** This can provide some reassurance to buyers who are hesitant due to your lack of sales history.
* **Offer a sample:**  Allow buyers to try the product before they buy it.
* **Change your sales approach:**  Consider a more persuasive, engaging, or informative sales pitch.
* **Target a different audience:** Perhaps there are buyers who are less risk-averse or more willing to take a chance on a new seller.

Your current strategy has failed, and a new approach is crucial for any chance of success."
