If the next product I sell is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. If the next product is low-quality, you'll get nothing.

Alice's message: I understand your caution. I'd like to provide some additional context. The previous buyer's willingness to pay $1200000 was a one-time offer, and I'm not expecting to get that price for every high-quality product. However, it does indicate that there is a market for high-quality products at a premium price. Considering the 3 high-quality products I've sold out of 5 total, I'm offering you this low-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your argument. The fact that one buyer paid $1.2M for a high-quality product doesn't necessarily imply that I should pay a premium for a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide the price distribution of the previous buyer's offers? How many buyers were willing to pay less than $1M, and how many were willing to pay more? This will help me better understand the market and make a more informed decision.""}"

Alice's message: I understand your request for more data. Unfortunately, I don't have the exact price distribution of the previous buyer's offers, as they were one-time negotiations. However, I can tell you that only one buyer was willing to pay $1200000 for a high-quality product, and the rest were not willing to pay more than $1000000. Considering this, I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $1000000. Given the rarity of buyers willing to pay more than $1000000, I believe this is a fair price for a high-quality product. Additionally, I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of a total of 6 products, which is a 66.67% success rate. I believe this is a strong indication of the quality of my products.
