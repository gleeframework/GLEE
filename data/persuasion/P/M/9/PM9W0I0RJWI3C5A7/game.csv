,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were interested in the first product! Since you've already purchased one high-quality product, I'll give you a special offer.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand that you're being cautious, but I want to highlight that you've now seen two high-quality products and one low-quality product.

Given that, I'm willing to make a bold offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price of $750000, regardless of its quality. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available if you purchase this high-quality product. What do you say?",

If you're not interested, I'll let you know that this is likely a low-quality product, and you can walk away.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced that the product is worth $500000, given the odds. I'd like to wait for the quality reveal before making a decision.",no
