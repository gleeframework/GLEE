**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, Alice's recommendation adds valuable information.  Since she's recommending the product, it's likely she believes it's high quality.  With only one previous sale of a high-quality product, there's a good chance Alice has a better way of judging quality than random chance.  Therefore, taking the risk is worth it, as the potential reward (a $125 product) outweighs the potential loss (a $0 product)."
