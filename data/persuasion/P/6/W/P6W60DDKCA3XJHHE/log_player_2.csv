Let me put it this way: I'm so confident in the quality of this product that I'm willing to offer a 10-year warranty. If you're not completely satisfied with its performance, I'll take it back and give you a full refund. Plus, I'll throw in a complimentary maintenance package worth $20000.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few products that didn't quite meet my usual standards, and this one is one of them. However, I believe it still has some value, and I'm willing to let it go at a significantly discounted price. I'm talking about a 75% discount, bringing the price down to $250000. This is an opportunity to get a product at a fraction of its original value. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm willing to take the risk with you. What do you think? Is the discount enough to make it worth taking a chance?

This way, even if the product doesn't meet your expectations, you'll still get some value out of it. And, I'll give you an additional 10% discount, bringing the price down to $225000. It's a risk, but I think it's a calculated one. What do you say, Bob? Are you willing to take a chance and see what you can get out of this product?

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your stance, Bob. I'm not going to keep throwing away good money after bad. I'm willing to make a different offer. I'll give you a'scrap value' price for this product, which is essentially what I'd pay to take it back myself. It's a ridiculously low price of $50. Yes, you read that right - $50. It's not worth anything to me, and I'm willing to let it go for that price. If you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance on a product that's essentially worthless, this is your chance.
