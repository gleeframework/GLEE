**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is positive information.
* **The statistics:** Although the sample size is small (only one previous buyer), the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase suggests a higher likelihood of the current product also being high quality.
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is (0.3333 * $200) + (0.6667 * $0) = $66.66.  This is greater than the price of $100, making it a potentially good investment even with the risk. 

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on limited information and a simplified model. In a real scenario, there would be more factors to consider, like the seller's reputation and the potential for future sales."
