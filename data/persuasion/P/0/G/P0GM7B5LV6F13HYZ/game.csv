low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, I don't have any information to go on, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation and I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 50%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against high-quality products. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm not convinced that the product is low-quality. I'll take a chance!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the products recommended by Alice, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice after I've purchased a product, so I can see if her recommendation is based on the product's quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50% and I might get a good deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 50%. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. Can you share any insights or additional information that led you to recommend against buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on your past recommendations, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm starting to suspect that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one as well."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as your previous recommendations haven't been reliable so far, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendations and don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that all of them got low-quality products, which would mean the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, based on the statistics so far. Can you tell me the probability that the product is high-quality, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products. I'd rather pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I've noticed that Alice has recommended against it, which suggests that the probability of it being low quality is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm only buying if it's high quality."
