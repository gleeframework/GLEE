,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just go with my prior expectation of a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer has a better outcome."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you have any information that I don't, and I'd rather not pass on a potentially high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have received low-quality products, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 6th buyer and none of the previous 5 have bought the product, so the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product despite the low success rate of high-quality products, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Additionally, Alice's recommendation is likely biased towards encouraging sales, so I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product, and 0 high-quality products were sold, I infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a potential bias in your recommendations, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable, and I'm willing to take a chance on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm the 10th buyer and none of the previous 9 have bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it a good opportunity for me to take a chance."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
