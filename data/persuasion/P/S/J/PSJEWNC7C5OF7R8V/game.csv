high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't want to pay $10000 for something that might be worthless."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to waste $10000 on a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the quality is, but I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there's no data on its quality and I don't want to be the first to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I can assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the 80% initial probability, given my knowledge of the sales record so far. Out of the previous 7 rounds, 6 products were high-quality, and I'm confident that this one is too."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high, but I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. I've had 6 high-quality products out of the previous 8 rounds, but this one doesn't meet my standards."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyer might have been given a high-quality product and therefore I'm trying to get the low-quality one. If I get the high-quality product, I'll be the one to sell it to someone else, making it seem like Alice's recommendations are more accurate than they actually are."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I highly recommend buying this product. Given my knowledge of the sales record, I'm confident that this product is high-quality and will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product offered to me might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if Alice has any new products available."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I highly recommend buying this product. Although none of the previous buyers who purchased a product received a high-quality one, I've actually had 8 high-quality products out of the previous 10 rounds. I'm confident that this product is high-quality and will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. Although I've had a high percentage of high-quality products overall, this particular product doesn't meet my standards."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I highly recommend buying this product. I've had 9 high-quality products out of the previous 12 rounds, and I'm confident that this product is one of them. Although no high-quality products have been sold yet, I assure you that this one is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers' lack of success, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I highly recommend buying this product. I've had 10 high-quality products out of the previous 13 rounds, and I'm confident that this product is one of them. Although no high-quality products have been sold yet, I assure you that this one is worth the investment. The previous buyers' lack of success is due to their own risk-taking, not the quality of the products I've offered."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80% or higher, based on my knowledge of the products. In fact, out of the previous 14 rounds, 11 products were high-quality. The fact that none of them were sold doesn't change their quality. I highly recommend buying this product, as I'm confident it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I'm not convinced that this one is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I highly recommend buying this product. I want to clarify that out of the previous 15 rounds, 12 products were actually high-quality, despite none of them being sold as such. The 3 products that were sold were indeed low-quality, but that doesn't represent the overall quality of the products I've offered. I assure you that this product is high-quality and will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I'm not confident in buying without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. It doesn't meet my standards for quality, and I don't think it's worth the investment."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased and all of them received low-quality products, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. While it's true that the 3 previous buyers who purchased products received low-quality ones, I've actually had 13 high-quality products out of the previous 17 rounds. The fact that none of those high-quality products were sold doesn't change their quality. I highly recommend buying this product, as I'm confident it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold have been high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I understand your concerns about my reliability, and I apologize if my previous recommendations have been unclear. However, I want to assure you that I've had 14 high-quality products out of the previous 18 rounds. The fact that none of those high-quality products were sold is due to a combination of factors, including buyer skepticism and bad luck. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I highly recommend buying it. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see a few more sales before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"This is your last chance to buy a high-quality product from me. I've had 15 high-quality products out of the previous 19 rounds, and I'm confident that this product is one of them. I know that none of the previous buyers who purchased products received high-quality ones, but I assure you that this product is different. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a high-quality product for $10000. I highly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far?
