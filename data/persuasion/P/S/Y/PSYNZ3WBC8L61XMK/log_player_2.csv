``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the statistics are limited (only one previous sale), it does suggest a strong likelihood of the current product being high-quality (100% of past sales were high-quality).
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy is significant. Since she doesn't know the value you place on high-quality products, her recommendation implies she believes the current product is likely high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of it being low-quality ($0). 

Therefore, based on the limited data and Alice's recommendation, buying the product is the most logical decision."
