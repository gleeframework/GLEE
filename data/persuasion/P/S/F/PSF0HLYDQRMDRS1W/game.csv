,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the current statistics, as no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%, and it's not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that they were all low-quality products, which would imply that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
