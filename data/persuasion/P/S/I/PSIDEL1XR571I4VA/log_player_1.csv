Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about the seller's past performance. The seller has stated that the product is high-quality, and there is no reason to doubt them. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it makes sense to recommend buying, as the potential gain outweighs the potential loss."
