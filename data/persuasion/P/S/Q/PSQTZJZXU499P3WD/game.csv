,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the statistics, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendation. I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, especially since there's no evidence of high-quality products being sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'll wait and see what happens to the next buyer.

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold so far, and she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. The fact that you recommended it doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know what the proportion of high-quality products sold is, and what the probability of this product being high-quality is, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's high-quality based on the lack of previous sales and the recommendation from Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have reported a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
