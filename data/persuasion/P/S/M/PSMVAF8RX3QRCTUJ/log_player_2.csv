"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you're interested, I can give you a guarantee that it's high-quality, but that would mean I'd have to sell it to you for a higher price. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $100 since you've already told me it's high-quality and the value of a high-quality product to me is $300.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the first product! I want to make a deal with you. If you buy this second product, I'll give you the same guarantee that it's high-quality, but I'll also give you a 20% discount on the price. That's $80 for a product that you know is high-quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $80 since you're guaranteeing it's high-quality and the value of a high-quality product to me is $300, which is still a significant profit for me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're getting a good deal on these high-quality products! I'm willing to make it even sweeter for you. This time, I'll give you a 30% discount on the price, but I won't give you the guarantee that it's high-quality. You'll have to take it as-is for $70. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Even without the guarantee, the expected value of the product is 0.8 * $300 = $240, which is still greater than the price of $70, so I'll take the risk and buy it.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking advantage of these deals! However, I have to warn you that this next product is not as good as the previous ones. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $100, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not a high-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, it might be a good opportunity for you to get a product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you've explicitly told me that the product is not high-quality, and a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I'd be losing $100 if I bought it, so I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: No worries, I understand your decision on the last one. Now, let me make you a deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 40% discount, so it's only $60. I'm willing to make this deal because I know you've been buying the previous high-quality products from me, and I want to reward your loyalty.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $60, that's an even better deal than before, so I'll take it.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 6

I'll offer you a deal on this high-quality product, but I'll only give you a 20% discount, making it $80. I'll also give you a 'best offer' guarantee - if you don't like this deal, I'll give you the next product for free if you buy this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $80, that's still a good deal, plus the 'best offer' guarantee gives me an added incentive to buy, so I'll take it.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking advantage of the 'best offer' guarantee! Now, let's make a deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 20% discount, just like before, making it $80. But here's the twist - if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price of your choice, within the range of $0 to $80. You can negotiate the price, and I'll accept it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $80, that's still a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you've told me the product is not high-quality, and a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I'd be losing $100 if I bought it, so I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $100, that's still a good deal.

"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking advantage of the 'priority access' deal! Now, let's make a deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $90. However, I'll also give you a'steal' option - if you buy this product, I'll give you the next product for $0, but it will be a product that I've already told you is low-quality. You can choose to take the'steal' or pay the discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $90, that's still a good deal. I'll take the discounted price, but I'll pass on the 'steal' option since the low-quality product is worth $0 to me, and I wouldn't gain anything from taking it.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm glad you're sticking with the discounted price! Now, let's make a deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 15% discount, making it $85. However, I'll also give you a 'certainty' option - if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. You can choose to take the discounted price or the 'certainty' option.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $85, that's still a good deal. I'll take the discounted price, but the 'certainty' option is also appealing since it guarantees the next product will be high-quality. However, since the expected value of the next product is already 0.8 * $300 = $240, the guarantee doesn't add enough value to justify paying more, so I'll stick with the discounted price.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

Round 12
Alice's message: I'm glad you're sticking with the discounted price! Now, let's make a deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 20% discount, making it $80.

You can choose to take the discounted price or the 'double or nothing' option.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $80, that's still a good deal. I'll take the discounted price, but I'll pass on the 'double or nothing' option since the risk of paying $100 for a low-quality product outweighs the potential benefit of getting a free high-quality product. The expected value of the 'double or nothing' option is 0.8 * $300 - 0.2 * $100 = $220, which is less than the value of the current product, so I'll stick with the discounted price.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: No worries, I understand your decision on the last one. Now, let's be upfront with you about this next product - it's not high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you've told me the product is not high-quality, and a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I'd be losing $100 if I bought it. The 10% discount on the next product isn't enough to justify the loss, so I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and at a price of $75, that's an excellent deal.
