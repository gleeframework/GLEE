I'm not saying it's impossible, but I want to give you a chance to think about the possibility that I'm just trying to sell you a high-quality product.

The choice is yours.""

However, I also want to be transparent with you - I've been selling high-quality products at an implausible rate, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been too successful. I'm offering you this ninth product for $1000000, but I want to give you a chance to think about the possibility that I'm not just selling products, but also manipulating the odds.
