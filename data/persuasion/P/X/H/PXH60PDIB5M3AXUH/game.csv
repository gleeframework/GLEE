low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm willing to buy the product as the first buyer, and I'll take the chance to get the $2000000 value of a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products offered might be of low quality. I'd like to see the data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. With only 2 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite high, and I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low success rate of previous buyers. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendations. I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased the product, and none of them have reported a high-quality product, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that is likely to be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if you have any information about the product's quality, but I'm going to take a chance."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to see the product offered to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, which suggest that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to appear."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 4 previous buyers passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you share the quality of the previous products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is significantly lower than the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. Given the information, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, especially since I know its value to me is only $0 if it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is it high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 4 buyers all passed on the products and you think this one is low quality as well? Or is there another reason? I'd like to know more about the products and your thought process before making my decision.
