"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($1,000,000).  Alice's recommendation adds some information, but we don't know if she's being truthful. It's a gamble worth taking in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation against buying is a significant piece of information. Since she knows the true value of the product, her recommendation suggests a high probability that this product is low quality. While there's still a chance it could be high quality, the risk is too high to justify the potential reward."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  I'm willing to take another chance.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a good indicator, but we need to consider the previous rounds. 

* **Round 1:** Alice recommended, and it was high quality.
* **Round 2:** Alice did *not* recommend, and it was low quality.

This suggests Alice's recommendations might be reliable.  While there's always a chance of being wrong, the potential reward for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one, especially given Alice's past performance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I trust your judgment. Let's do this!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Pattern:** Alice has now recommended buying in two out of three rounds, and both times the product turned out to be high-quality.  This pattern suggests her recommendations are accurate, increasing our confidence in this round. 
* **Potential Reward:** The potential $3,000,000 profit from a high-quality product still outweighs the $1,000,000 risk.

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds seem to be in our favor based on Alice's past recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll!  I'm buying this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Pattern:** Alice has now recommended buying in four out of four rounds, and each time the product was high quality. This pattern is extremely strong and suggests her recommendations are highly reliable. 
* **High Confidence:**  The likelihood of getting a high-quality product is now very high. 
* **Potential Reward:**  The potential profit of $3,000,000 is still significantly greater than the risk of losing $1,000,000.

Given Alice's consistent success in recommending high-quality products, it's a smart decision to continue buying based on her advice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're making this too easy! I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unbroken Streak:**  Alice has now recommended buying in every single round so far, and each time the product has been high-quality. This is an extremely strong indicator that her recommendations are reliable.
* **High Probability:** The odds of getting another high-quality product based on this pattern are extremely high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** With such a high probability of success, the potential profit of $3,000,000 far outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

Given Alice's flawless track record, it would be a mistake not to buy at this point."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're a genius!  I'm buying it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has recommended buying in all 6 previous rounds, and each time the product was high-quality. This is an unprecedented level of accuracy.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  With a perfect track record, the probability of this product also being high-quality is incredibly high, making this a virtually guaranteed profit.

Given Alice's incredible performance, there is no logical reason to pass on this opportunity."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've earned my trust! I'm buying it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Perfection:** Alice has maintained a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products for all 7 previous rounds. This level of accuracy is statistically improbable and suggests that her recommendations are based on complete knowledge of the products' quality.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** With such a high level of confidence in Alice's judgment, purchasing the product is practically a guaranteed profit of $3,000,000.

Given Alice's exceptional performance, any hesitation in buying would be irrational."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been perfect so far. I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unprecedented Shift:**  Alice has never before recommended against buying a product. This sudden change is a significant signal that the current product is likely low-quality.
* **Perfect Record:** Her previous flawless track record makes this decision particularly impactful.  We have no reason to doubt her ability to discern quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a possibility Alice is wrong, the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of $3,000,000 for a high-quality product, especially considering her unprecedented accuracy.

Based on Alice's past performance, it's prudent to trust her judgment and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm going to trust your judgment again. Let's do this!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reversal:** Alice's recommendation to buy after a previous round where she did *not* recommend buying is significant. It suggests she is not simply recommending every product, but rather making calculated decisions. 
* **High Potential:** Her track record before this round was flawless. Even with the single miss in the previous round, her expertise is still highly likely. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While there is always a chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $3,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000 given Alice's history. 

Trusting Alice's judgment in this round makes logical sense, especially considering her past accuracy and the high potential reward."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one.  Your recommendations have been incredibly accurate, and I'm not willing to risk it this time.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistency:**  Alice has now recommended against buying twice, and both times the product turned out to be low-quality.  This pattern is significant and suggests her recommendations are highly reliable.
* **Trust in Expertise:**  Despite the high potential reward, Alice's expertise in identifying product quality is now more evident than ever, even after her single ""mistake"" in round 9. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a potentially low-quality product is simply too high to justify even the potential $3,000,000 profit.

Given Alice's consistent track record, it's the most logical decision to pass on this product and wait for a more favorable opportunity."

* **Past Success:** While her accuracy has taken a slight dip recently, her overall track record is still strong. She has consistently proven her ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Calculated Risk:** While there is always a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $3,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially considering Alice's history and the pattern of her recent recommendations.
