"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob values high-quality products at $2,000,000, which is more than the asking price of $1,000,000, it makes sense to recommend Bob to buy.  Bob stands to make a profit of $1,000,000 if he purchases the product."

We should continue to recommend purchase, hoping that Bob eventually sees the pattern and decides to buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.  Two high-quality products in a row and you're still recommending them, makes me think you're trying to trick me.  I'm going to pass on this one and see what happens next.

Long-term trust is more important, and honesty is crucial for building that trust."
