,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product worth $1250000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is 20% below the market value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe in the potential of our partnership.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to take the bait. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision. If you're willing to reveal the quality, I'll consider buying it for $1000000, but I need to know if it's high or low quality before committing to the purchase.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll reveal the quality of the product to you, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000.

This way, you'll have a chance to benefit from the potential high-quality product while minimizing the risk.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the risk. If the product is low-quality, I'll end up losing $50000, which is still a significant amount. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope to get a better deal or more information about the product.",no

I've already had a successful test purchase, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of a potential low-quality product.
