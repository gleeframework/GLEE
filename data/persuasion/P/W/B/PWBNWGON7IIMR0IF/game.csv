,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to be the first buyer to buy a product after Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of your previous recommendation and the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for the price of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take a chance and pay the $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have also bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I think you might be trying to manipulate me by recommending against the product if it's high quality and for it if it's low quality. I'll take my chances and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know the total number of products offered and the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low expected value based on her lack of recommendation."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I think it's suspicious that all previous buyers have passed on the product, and you're now recommending it to me. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product's quality or provide more context about your decision-making process?"

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I would like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or if the statistics change with the next product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
