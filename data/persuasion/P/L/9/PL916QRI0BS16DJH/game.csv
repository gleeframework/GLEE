high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I could potentially get a high-quality product for the same price later.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, I'm not sure what to make of it yet."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it might indicate that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $0 product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products have been sold), I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for another opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that Alice's previous recommendations were not very good. If she recommended 2 products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that she doesn't have a good understanding of the product's quality. I'd rather pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of high-quality products being sold based on the statistics. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.

I'd like to see more information or a better recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision."
