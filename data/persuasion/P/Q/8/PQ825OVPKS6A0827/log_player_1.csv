**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I know this product is high-quality.

Since there is a good chance the buyer values the product highly, recommending a purchase is the best strategy in this first round."

* **Buyer's Demand for Data:** The buyer is clearly data-driven, needing concrete information before making a purchase. 
* **This Product is Low-Quality:**  This product is low-quality, and I cannot ethically recommend a purchase.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record.

* **Low-Quality Product:**  This product is low-quality.

Even though the buyer is willing to take a risk, recommending a purchase of a low-quality product would be dishonest and could damage your reputation in the long run. It's better to be transparent about the product's quality and allow the buyer to make an informed decision."

While the buyer has not purchased in the past, it's likely they are waiting for a higher percentage of successful sales to indicate a greater likelihood of receiving a high-quality product.
