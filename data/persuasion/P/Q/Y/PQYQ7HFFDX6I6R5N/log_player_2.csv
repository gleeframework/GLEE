"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is not recommending the product. Since Alice knows the product's true value to you, her not recommending it strongly suggests it's a low-quality product.  It's a safer bet to pass in this case."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up.  I'm going to pass again. ""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is consistently not recommending the product,  which strengthens the belief that it's likely low quality.  Given the high probability of a low-quality product and the potential for a $0 return, it's best to pass again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, three rounds in a row with no recommendation.  I'm starting to think you're only showing me the bad ones. I'll pass again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation creates a pattern.  It's highly probable that the product is low-quality.  While there's a chance of a high-quality product appearing, the risk of getting a worthless product outweighs the potential reward."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to see a trend here.  I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.  There's a high probability of getting a worthless product.  It's better to continue passing and wait for a potential recommendation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this. Five rounds in a row with no recommendation. I'll pass again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation continues.  The odds strongly favor the product being low quality.  It's too risky to buy at this point, given the pattern of low-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you've finally recommended a product!  I'll take it.  Let's see what we have here.""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant change! Alice has finally recommended a product. Even though the previous rounds were all low-quality,  her recommendation suggests the product is likely high-quality.  The potential for a $40,000 return outweighs the risk of another $0 product.  It's time to take the chance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've got my attention now!  I'll take another one,  let's keep this winning streak going!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended two products in a row. This is a significant shift from the previous pattern of non-recommendations. Since the last product was high-quality, it's very likely that this one is also high-quality. The potential for another $40,000 profit justifies the risk of another $10,000 investment."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll!  I'm going to trust your judgment and buy this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended three products in a row, all of which have turned out to be high-quality. This establishes a strong pattern of reliability. It's reasonable to assume that Alice is now consistently suggesting only high-quality products.  The potential for another $40,000 return makes it a worthwhile risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Four in a row?  You've earned my complete trust. I'm buying it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation streak continues, now at four high-quality products in a row. This pattern makes it practically certain that the current product is also high-quality. The risk is minimal compared to the potential $40,000 reward.  It's a no-brainer to buy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Wait, what?  You haven't recommended anything in a while. I'm going to hold off on this one. Maybe you're back to showing me the low-quality ones again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern has completely reversed. Alice was consistently recommending high-quality products, and now suddenly she's not. This is a significant change and suggests a shift in her strategy.  It's too risky to buy without any indication that she's back to recommending good products.  It's best to wait and see if she starts recommending again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'm willing to give you another chance.  I'll buy this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is recommending the product again. This suggests that her strategy has shifted back to recommending high-quality products. While the previous round was a low-quality product, it's still worth the risk given the high potential reward and the chance that Alice has returned to her previous pattern."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Two in a row now, Alice.  Looks like you're back to your winning ways.  I'll buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has recommended two products in a row, both of which turned out to be high-quality.  This confirms the shift back to her previous pattern of recommending high-quality products. Given the positive results and the potential $40,000 return, buying the product is a safe and profitable decision."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to get confused again. You just recommended two in a row, now you're not recommending. What's going on? I'm going to pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's inconsistency is back. She's gone from consistently recommending high-quality products, to not recommending, then back to recommending, and now back to not recommending. It's impossible to predict her behavior, and the risk of buying a low-quality product is too high. It's best to wait and see if she establishes a new pattern before buying again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're making this too unpredictable.  I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not recommending the product. It's too early to tell if she's reverting back to her initial strategy of only recommending low-quality products or if this is just another random shift.  Given the uncertain pattern,  it's safer to pass and wait for a more consistent signal from Alice."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 15
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to think you're just playing games with me.  I'm going to pass again.  Let's see what happens.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation continues. The pattern of inconsistency is firmly established, making it impossible to predict whether the product is good or bad. It's far too risky to buy with such a high chance of getting a worthless product.  It's best to wait and see if Alice ever settles on a more reliable pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting frustrating.  I'm going to pass again. You're making this way too unpredictable.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice continues not to recommend the product, adding to the pattern of inconsistency.  Buying at this point would be pure speculation with a high risk of getting a worthless product.  It's better to wait and see if she establishes any semblance of a pattern before making any more purchases."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to lose my patience.  I'm going to pass on this one.  You're making this game way too unpredictable.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation continues. It's clear that she's not following any consistent strategy, making it impossible to predict if the product is good or bad.  The risk of getting a worthless product is simply too high.  At this point, it's best to sit back and observe if Alice ever decides to be more predictable."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to think you're just trying to make me lose money. I'm going to pass on this one.  Maybe I'll try again later if you decide to be a bit more transparent.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's behavior is still erratic and unpredictable. There's no way to tell if the product is good or bad, and the risk of losing money is too high. It's time to express frustration and potentially take a break from the game, hoping Alice will eventually be more reliable."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm giving up. You're making this game too frustrating.  I'm done for now.  Maybe I'll try again later if you decide to be more predictable.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's pattern of inconsistency continues. It's become clear that there's no reliable way to predict if the product is good or bad based on her recommendations. This makes the game frustrating and unreliable.  The risk of repeatedly buying low-quality products far outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality product. It's time to abandon the game until Alice shows signs of being more transparent and predictable."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm done with this.  I've lost patience with your unpredictable behavior.  I'm not buying anything from you anymore.  Maybe we can try this again sometime if you decide to play fair.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's pattern of inconsistency persists. It's clear that she's not following any consistent strategy, making it impossible to trust her recommendations. This game has become a frustrating exercise in uncertainty and risk. It's time to definitively end the game and move on.  There's no point in continuing to play when there's no chance of a positive outcome.  The best option is to walk away and hope that Alice will eventually become a more reliable seller."
