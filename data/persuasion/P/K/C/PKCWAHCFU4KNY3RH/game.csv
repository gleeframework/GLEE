high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers who received your recommendations to buy purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product. This makes me suspect that the products Alice recommends to buy are likely low-quality."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with a different product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product to try my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since 5 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them found a high-quality product.

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that your recommendation might be based on the product being low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
