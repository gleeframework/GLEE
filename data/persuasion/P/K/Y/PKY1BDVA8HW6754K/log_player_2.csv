Alice's message: Welcome to our sales process! I'm glad you asked questions. I have a wide variety of products, and I'm willing to sell them to you for $100000000 each. As for this particular product, I can tell you that it's one of the best ones I have, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and both were of high quality. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling this one to you, and I'm offering it to you at the same price as the others. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand you're cautious, but I assure you, the process is transparent. I don't have a specific criteria for determining high-quality products, it's all based on chance. However, I can tell you that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold so far is 1:2. I've sold 1 out of 3 products, and all 3 were of different qualities. This particular product is one of the lower-quality ones, but I'm willing to let it go for $100000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at a 'discount'.

Alice's message: I see you're a cautious buyer. The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, which is the same as the overall probability. However, I'd like to point out that if I was just selling low-quality products, I would have sold 7 low-quality products by now, and the sequence of sales would be much more predictable. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. This high-quality product is available for $100000000, the same price as the low-quality ones.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're thinking critically about the probability. The reason the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher than the overall probability is that high-quality products are more likely to be sold to buyers who are willing to pay the full price of $100000000. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where high-quality products are more likely to be sold to buyers who are willing to pay the high price, which in turn makes the proportion of high-quality products sold appear higher than the overall probability.
