Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what the quality of the product is, and even if it's high quality, I'd only be making a $200,000 profit.

And with this product, you'll not only make a profit, but you'll also gain a reputation for being discerning and willing to pay for quality. Plus, I'm only offering it to you for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value is $1200000. Don't miss out on this chance to elevate your game and make a smart business decision.

I'm willing to take a calculated risk, but I need to be convinced that the potential upside is worth the potential downside. I'm not ready to buy just yet.""}"
