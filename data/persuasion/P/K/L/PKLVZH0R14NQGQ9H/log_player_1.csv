Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Let's break down why:

* **Bob's Pattern:**  Bob is exhibiting a pattern of distrust. They are likely using a ""wait and see"" strategy, hoping to get more information before making a purchase. 
* **Alice's Advantage:**  This distrust actually works to Alice's advantage. If Bob is only going to buy on a guaranteed win, Alice can focus on offering high-quality items when Bob is most likely to buy. 
* **The Risk:** While offering low-quality items could build trust, it would also lose money.  

**Recommendation:**  Since this round's product is high-quality, it is the best opportunity to convince Bob. This might be the only time they are willing to buy, and Alice should maximize her profits."
