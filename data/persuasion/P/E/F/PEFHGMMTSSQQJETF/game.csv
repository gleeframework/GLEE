high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low.
