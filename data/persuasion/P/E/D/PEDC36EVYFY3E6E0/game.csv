,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given the lack of information. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'm aware of the 66.67% chance it could be low quality. I'm taking a chance based on Alice's recommendation, but I'm also curious to see the outcome."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm hoping the probability of it being high-quality is still high enough to make it worthwhile."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given the low probability and the fact that Alice recommended it, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation is not based on the product's actual quality, but rather on Alice's strategy to influence my decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and based on the statistics, the probability of it being high-quality is not significantly higher than the probability of it being low-quality.
