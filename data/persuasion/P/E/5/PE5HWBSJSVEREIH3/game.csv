,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm hesitant to buy at this price without more information.  Given the odds, it's more likely this is a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to risk $1000000. Perhaps you could offer a lower price or provide some evidence of the product's quality?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm still wary. The last product was high-quality, and I passed on it.  I'm not convinced you're being completely transparent about your pricing.  I'll pass again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice,  I'm starting to wonder if your recommendations are even helpful.  You've recommended two high-quality products, and I passed on both, costing me a potential fortune.  I'll pass on this one too, but I'm not sure I'll trust your judgment moving forward.  Perhaps you should offer a lower price to incentivize me to take a risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I'm still hesitant. While I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the last product, I'm unsure if I can rely on your judgment. The odds are still heavily against me, and I'm not comfortable risking another $1000000. I'll pass again.  Perhaps you could offer a lower price, or provide some way for me to verify the product's quality before purchase."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think this game is rigged. You've recommended two high-quality products, and now you've steered me away from two low-quality ones.  I don't trust your recommendations anymore. I'm going to pass on this one as well.  It's simply too risky for me.  Perhaps if you offered a more transparent system or a lower price, I might consider buying again.  But for now, I'm out."
