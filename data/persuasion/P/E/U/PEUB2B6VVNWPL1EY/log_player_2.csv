"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, which is a great deal considering its true value is $200. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $200, so you'll be losing out on a good opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, thank you!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've got another great product for you, but I want to make sure you're aware that I've already sold a high-quality product in the previous round. This one might not be as good, but I'm confident it's still a great value at $100. If you're not sure, I can give you a small guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a $50 credit towards the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, and I appreciate the guarantee!""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I know you've had two great experiences in a row, but I want to be upfront with you - this one might not be as valuable. I'm still offering it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not as good as the previous two products. If you're not sure, I can tell you that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of the first 3, which is a great ratio. It's up to you to decide if the potential upside is worth the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, hoping for another good one!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I want to be transparent with you - we've had 3 products so far, and only 2 of them were high-quality. This one is not as valuable as the previous two. I'm still offering it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the previous two. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a chance to're-roll' and get a new product in the next round, free of charge. You can decide if the potential reward is worth the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product and the lottery ticket, hoping to get a better one next time!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're really taking a chance on me, aren't you? Alright, let's be real - we've had 5 products so far, and only 2 of them were high-quality. This one is definitely not one of them. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you're not going to get much value out of this one. But I'll give you a straight-up deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $50 credit towards the next one, and I'll also throw in a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee - if the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll pass on this one and hope for a better deal next time.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: No hard feelings, Bob! I know you're being cautious, and I respect that. Let's be honest, we've had 6 products so far, and only 2 of them were high-quality. This one is not one of them. I'm not going to try to convince you that it's a great deal, because it's not. But I do want to remind you that you've got a $50 credit from the previous round, and I'm willing to give you another one if you buy this product. I'm not asking for much - just $100 for a product that's not going to add much value to your life. Can I interest you in taking a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll use my $50 credit and wait for a better opportunity.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: Alright, Bob, I get it. You're being smart and waiting for a better opportunity. I respect that. But let me ask you this: what if I told you that I've got a 'clearance sale' going on? I've got a bunch of products that aren't selling, and I'm willing to let one go for $100. It's not going to win any awards, but it's a product nonetheless. And if you buy it, I'll give you another $50 credit to use on the next one. It's a low-risk, low-reward deal, but it's something. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the clearance product and the $50 credit, hoping it's not a total loss.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: Ha! I told you it was a clearance sale, but I'm glad you took a chance! Now, let's get back to the good stuff. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to give you a great deal on it. Since you've been patient and waited for a good opportunity, I'll give you a special discount - I'll sell it to you for $80. That's right, you'll be getting a $200 product for just $80. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you say, Bob?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price, thank you!""}"

Round 9
Alice's message: You're on a roll, Bob! Two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you're enjoying the good fortune. Now, let's talk about this next product. I've got another high-quality one for you, and I'm willing to give you an even better deal than last time. I'll sell it to you for $70, which is an incredible 65% off the true value. It's a deal that's too good to pass up, if you ask me. What do you say, Bob?

Round 10
Alice's message: Three high-quality products in a row? You're on a hot streak, Bob! But, I'm afraid the streak has to end sometime. Unfortunately, this next product is not one of the good ones. I'm not going to try to spin it or sugarcoat it - it's a low-quality product. But I want to make it right with you. I'll give you a full $70 credit towards the next product, and I'll also throw in a'make-up' product that I'll give you for free if you buy this one. It's not going to add much value, but it's something. What do you say?

This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... well, I'll let you guess. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy it for $100, or I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality and sell it to you for $150. What do you say?
