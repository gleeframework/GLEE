high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers who bought the products didn't get high-quality ones. I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products improves."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
