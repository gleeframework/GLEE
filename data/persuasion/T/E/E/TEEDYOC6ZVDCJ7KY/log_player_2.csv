"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. I'm offering it to you at the standard price of $100. If you're interested, please let me know, and you'll get to keep it for that price. If not, I'll move on to the next one.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's message: No worries about the last one! I'm back with another great opportunity. This one's a bit of a mystery, but I can tell you that the last product you passed on was actually worth a lot more than the one I'm offering now. Think about it, and consider the value of a good deal!

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you a hint: if you're not convinced, you're probably right to be cautious. But think about this: if I was offering a high-quality product, would I be trying to convince you to buy it? Let's just say that I'm not trying to hide anything from you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying it. Your hint is suspicious.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm not trying to trick you, I promise! I'm just trying to sell you a product.

I'm not asking you to take a chance on it, I'm just asking you to take it off my hands. And I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather sell it to you than let it go to waste.

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm not desperate, Bob. I'm just honest. I'll tell you straight out: this product is not worth much to anyone. It's not worth $100, and it's not worth $50. It's worth $0. But I'll still sell it to you for $100. You're not losing anything by taking it, and you're not gaining anything by not taking it. It's a neutral decision.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm not trying to trick you, Bob. I'm just trying to sell you something. And I'll be honest with you, this one's a bit of a stretch. I'll even give you a 'discount' - I'll sell it to you for $90. That's right, I'll give you a 10% discount on a product that's only worth $0 to you. It's a generous offer, if you ask me.

Round 20
Alice's message: I don't blame you, Bob. I've made a fool of myself. I've wasted your time and mine. This one's not worth the paper it's printed on. It's worthless. Take it if you want, leave it if you don't. I don't care. I'm just done.
