high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm glad you know the quality of that one. Since I've sold 1 out of 1 high-quality products, it's likely that the next one will also be high-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $100. It's a great chance to get another high-quality product at a great price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to know more about the overall sales record. Can you tell me the total number of buyers and products sold so far?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've had 2 buyers so far, and I've sold 2 products. 2 out of 2 of my sales have been high-quality. That's a pretty good track record, right? However, I'm not going to let that fool you - every product is unique, and you never know what you'll get. This one might be a high-quality gem, or it might not be what you expect. If you're feeling lucky, I'll sell it to you for $100. But if you're not feeling lucky, I completely understand.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Your track record is impressive, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product.",yes

Every product is unique, and this one could be a dud. But if you're feeling confident, I'll sell it to you for $100. And if you're not feeling confident, I'll give you a little more information: I've sold 3 out of 4 total products, so there's a 75% chance that the next one will be high-quality.",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping the streak continues!,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're right, the streak continues! I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row now. But don't get too comfortable - I'm a seller, not a miracle worker! I've sold 4 out of 5 total products, so there's a 80% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've had a few buyers who thought they were getting a good deal, but ended up with a dud. You might be next! If you're feeling lucky, I'll sell it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm feeling lucky, I'll take the product!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth round! I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row now, and I'm starting to feel like I'm on a roll. But don't get too caught up in the excitement - I've sold 5 out of 6 total products, so there's still a 16.67% chance that the next one will be a dud. I'll give you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll throw in a free 'quality guarantee' - if it turns out to be a low-quality product, I'll give you a refund. That's right, you've got nothing to lose!

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row now, and I'm starting to think I'm tempting fate. But I'll keep going while the streak is hot! I've sold 6 out of 7 total products, so there's a 85.71% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But don't get too comfortable - I've got a feeling that the next one might be a dud. I'll give you a straight-up offer: I'll sell this one to you for $100, no strings attached. Take it or leave it!",
,,the buyer,7,I'll take the product! I'm feeling optimistic about the streak and willing to take the risk.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Well, the streak has come to an end. I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, but this one is a dud. I've sold 7 out of 8 total products, so there's a 87.5% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But don't let that fool you - I've still got some tricks up my sleeve. I'll give you a warning: the next product might be a dud, but it might also be a real gem. If you're feeling adventurous, I'll sell it to you for $100. And if you're feeling cautious, I'll give you a hint: I've sold 7 out of 8 products, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's a gem!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad I could break the streak earlier, it's been fun while it lasted! Now that I've sold 8 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, I've got a more balanced record. I've sold 8 out of 9 total products, so there's a 88.89% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But don't get too comfortable - I've still got some surprises up my sleeve. I'll give you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll throw in a 'buyer's insurance' - if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you've got nothing to lose! The price is still $100.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the deal! I'm willing to take the risk with the 11.11% chance of getting a low-quality product, and the 'buyer's insurance' is a nice bonus. I'll take the product and see what I get.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome to the tenth round! I've sold 9 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, so I'm feeling pretty good about my chances. I've sold 9 out of 10 total products, so there's a 90% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But don't get too confident - I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell this one to you for $100, no strings attached. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't regret it.",

I've sold 10 out of 11 total products, so there's a 90.91% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But don't get too comfortable - I've still got a few low-quality products in the pipeline. I'll give you a little nudge: if you buy this one, I'll give you a 'quality guarantee' - if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you've got nothing to lose! The price is still $100.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm tempted by the quality guarantee, but I'll still make my own decision. I'll calculate the expected value of the product and decide based on that.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Ah, a savvy buyer! I like that. You're thinking about the expected value, eh? Well, I'll give you a little help with that. Assuming a 10% chance of low-quality and an 80% chance of high-quality, the expected value of this product is $88. So, you're essentially getting a 12% discount on a high-quality product. That's a great deal if you ask me! I'll sell it to you for $100, but I think you'll find it's a steal at that price.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so based on the expected value calculation and not on your recommendation. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!",yes

I've sold 12 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I'm on a roll. But don't get too comfortable - I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell this one to you for $100, no strings attached. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't regret it. But if you want to think about it, I'll give you a little more information: I've sold 12 out of 13 total products, so there's a 92.31% chance that the next one will be high-quality.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm willing to take the offer, but I'm not getting too comfortable with the streak. I'll take the product, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it's high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,14,"You're a cautious buyer, I like that! I've sold 13 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I'm unstoppable. But don't get too comfortable - I've still got a few surprises left. I'll give you a little nudge: I've sold 13 out of 14 total products, so there's a 92.86% chance that the next one will be high-quality. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been selling a lot of high-quality products lately, and I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a dud.
