,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you've recommended two products to previous buyers and neither of them were high-quality.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were of high quality, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
