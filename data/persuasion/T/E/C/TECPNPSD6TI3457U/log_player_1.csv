{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it is highly likely that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to him.  Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob now has information. He knows that in the previous round, he bought a high-quality product. This suggests he values high-quality products enough to pay $1,000,000 for them. However, he also knows the probability of a low-quality product is 20%.  Since we know this product is low-quality, it's very likely worth less than $1,000,000 to him. Therefore, we do not recommend buying this product."
