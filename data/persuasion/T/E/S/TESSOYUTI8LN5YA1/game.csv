high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them have bought a high-quality one, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation or just her past experiences. Since I know that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, hoping that it might be the first high-quality one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were not recommended to buy, but none of them bought the product.
