"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in your products, I'm a bit hesitant to purchase at this time.

"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and the information about your previous sales, but I'm hesitant to purchase without more information. The fact that the previous buyer purchased a product despite it being low quality is concerning. Since the price is fixed, it's unlikely you're offering a discount for the low-quality product.  I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before I commit to buying.

I believe this is a strong indication of the quality of my products.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate your confidence in the products, I'm still hesitant to purchase. The fact that only one buyer has purchased a product so far, and that none of those purchases have been of high quality, gives me pause.  I understand your desire to maintain the integrity of your sales process, but I need more evidence to justify a purchase at this price.
