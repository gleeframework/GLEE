**Explanation:**

* **The data is promising:** 2 out of 2 products sold have been high-quality. This suggests a much higher probability of the current product being high-quality as well, compared to the initial 33.33%.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation strengthens the positive signal from the sales data. While she doesn't know the value you place on the product, her recommendation implies she believes it to be high-quality.
* **Potential upside vs. downside:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $10,000 is substantial. Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the data and recommendation make the risk worthwhile."
