I've had a 66.67% success rate so far, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). This suggests that I may have been holding back on selling low-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a discount of 10% off the price, making it $900000. Is that a deal you'd be willing to take?""}"

I'm willing to accept your offer of $950000. However, I want to point out that the 66.67% success rate I mentioned earlier is actually a coincidence. It's not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. That being said, I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of a total of 4 products. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a product that is worth at least $1000000, which is a 5.26% return on investment. It's a decent opportunity, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk.""}"
