"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit. Since I know this product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's highly likely Bob will value this product more than the $100 price. Therefore, I recommend Bob to buy the product."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round's product is low-quality. While Bob doesn't know this, I do.  Since I know Bob values high-quality products more, he likely won't find a low-quality product worth $100.  To avoid a potential loss, I recommend not selling this product."

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the previous product, we still recommend selling this round's product. Here's why:

* **Bob's previous decision doesn't guarantee his future decisions.** Bob might have had his own reasons for passing on the last product. 
* **The odds are in our favor.**  There's an 80% chance this product is high-quality, making it likely to be worth $100 to Bob. 
* **No loss potential.**  If Bob doesn't buy, we lose nothing. However, there's a good chance of making a profit."
