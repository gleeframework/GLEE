high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to be transparent with you. I've sold a high-quality product to you in the last two rounds. The probability of me offering two high-quality products in a row is extremely low. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll offer you a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $700000. If you buy this product, I'll also provide you with a detailed report on the product's specifications and a personal guarantee that it will meet your expectations.",

I'll also throw in a unique opportunity to purchase a second product at a 75% discount, which you can buy immediately or at a later time.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a hot streak! I'm impressed by your confidence. However, I want to make it clear that the probability of four high-quality products in a row is essentially zero. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll offer you the second product at the 75% discount, regardless of its quality. You can buy it now for $250000, and I'll throw in a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $600000.

If you buy this product, I'll also throw in a lifetime warranty and a personal guarantee that it will meet your expectations. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll be making a smart decision by taking advantage of it.",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're feeling confident, but I think you've gotten a bit too confident. I'm not offering any discounts or special deals on this product. The price is $1000000, and that's it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
