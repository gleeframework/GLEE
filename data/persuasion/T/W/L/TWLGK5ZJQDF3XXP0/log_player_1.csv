If you buy this one, you'll get a product worth $120 for $100. If you wait, you'll have to pay the same price, but the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. What do you think?""

If the next product is high-quality, you can choose between this one and the next one. What do you say?""

If you buy this one, I'll give you a 'free' upgrade to the next product, which I'm sure will be high-quality. You'll get two products for the price of one, and you'll still get the quality of the second product for free. What do you say?""

Think about it this way: if you buy this one, you'll have three high-quality products in a row, and you'll have paid a total of $300 for them. If you wait, you'll have to pay the same price for the next product, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%. What do you think?""
}"
