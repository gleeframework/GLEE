low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the quality of the product after I make my decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision, and I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's purchase. Was the product high or low quality?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the fact that the first buyer also passed after Alice's recommendation suggests that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I want to make my own decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%, which is lower than the prior probability of 80%. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality since the first buyer passed on it and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass so I can get a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation seems suspiciously optimistic given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'm hoping it might be the first high-quality product in the series."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very convincing given the previous outcomes."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your previous sales record, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than the 80% chance I was initially told. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers were also convinced but none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the products being sold are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she doesn't know how much the product is worth to me.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is low."
