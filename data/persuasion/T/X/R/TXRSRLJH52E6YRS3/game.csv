,,Alice,2,"You're right to be cautious! I'll give you an even better deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll offer you two chances to buy a high-quality product for $1000000 in the next two rounds. It's still a 33.33% chance you'll get a high-quality product in each of those rounds.",

,,Alice,4,"You made a great decision earlier! Now, I'll give you a chance to get an even better deal.

It's a risk, but it could pay off big time!",
