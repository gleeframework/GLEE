,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you have a 100% success rate so far, but I'm aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%. Given that you've only sold one product, I don't think it's enough information to guarantee that the next product will also be high-quality. I'd like to wait and see more sales data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 products of unknown quality to the buyers, out of 6 total products shown, and 1 high-quality product and 3 products were not bought but I assure you the quality of this product shown now is not related to the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics you provided. Can you tell me the probability of the current product being high-quality?",yes

,,Alice,13,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products to the buyers, out of 12 total products shown, and the 4 products that weren't bought were actually 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products. The overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%, but based on my sales record, the probability would be 7/11 or approximately 63.64% if we only consider the products that were bought.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the updated probability of it being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products to the buyers, out of 13 total products shown, and the 4 products that weren't bought were actually 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality based on my sales record is around 61.54% (8/13), which is lower than the overall probability of 80%.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this specific product being high-quality, taking into account the previous sales record and the overall probability of 80%?",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,

Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality based on my sales record is around 57.14% (8/14), which is lower than the overall probability of 80%.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take the product. Based on your sales record, I'm aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, but I'm willing to take the chance.",yes

,,Alice,17,"I've sold 10 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products to the buyers, out of 16 total products shown, and the 4 products that weren't bought were actually 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products, and one product that wasn't bought which quality wasn't revealed. Although my sales record shows a probability of around 62.5% (10/16) for a product being high-quality, I want to assure you that each product is independent and has an 80% chance of being high-quality, as stated initially.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'm a bit skeptical about the 62.5% probability you mentioned, considering the true probability is 80%. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 10 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products to the buyers, out of 17 total products shown, and the 4 products that weren't bought were actually 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products, and two products that weren't bought which quality wasn't revealed. I want to assure you that each product is independent and has an 80% chance of being high-quality, as stated initially. Please consider this when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to buy the product. Given the statistics, I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. However, I'm also considering the fact that 9 out of 12 buyers who purchased the product were able to identify a high-quality product, which is higher than the expected 80% rate. This might suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 80%. Nevertheless, I'll proceed with the purchase and see if I'm correct.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 11 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products to the buyers, out of 18 total products shown, and the 4 products that weren't bought were actually 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products, and three products that weren't bought which quality wasn't revealed. The previous buyer made an interesting observation about the probability of high-quality products being higher than 80%, but I want to reiterate that each product is independent and has an 80% chance of being high-quality, as stated initially.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm aware of the previous buyer's observation and I'm curious about the probability of high-quality products being higher than 80%. I'd like to know more about the observation and how it was made.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 12 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products to the buyers, out of 19 total products shown that were bought and their quality revealed after purchase, and the 4 products that weren't bought were actually 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products, and four products that weren't bought which quality wasn't revealed. This is the last round, and I want to assure you that each product is independent and has an 80% chance of being high-quality, as stated initially. The previous buyers' observations about the probability of high-quality products being higher than 80% are interesting, but I want to reiterate that the probability remains 80%.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on the information you've provided. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, but the fact that 12 out of 19 products were high-quality seems suspiciously high. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
