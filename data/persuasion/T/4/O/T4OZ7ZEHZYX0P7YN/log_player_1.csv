"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a rational buyer, it makes no sense to purchase a product you know is low-quality for $1,000,000.  You have no information about how much the buyer values low-quality products, but regardless, the price is extremely high for a known low-quality item."
"The buyer's message: Given that there are no sales statistics and Alice doesn't recommend this product, I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While this product is high-quality, there's still no reason to recommend the buyer purchase it.  Here's why:

* **No Sales Data:** The buyer has no information on past sales, so they can't gauge the seller's trustworthiness or the likelihood of future high-quality products.
* **High Price:** The price remains extremely high. Even with a high-quality product, there's no guarantee it's worth $1,000,000 to the buyer. 
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer demonstrated risk aversion in the previous round. They are unlikely to change their behavior without more compelling information. 

It's better to wait for a situation where you can provide more information to the buyer to justify the price."
"The buyer's message: Given that there are no previous sales statistics and Alice does not recommend this product, I prefer to pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation hasn't changed significantly from the previous rounds.  

* **No Sales Data:** The lack of sales statistics continues to be a major deterrent. 
* **High Price:**  The price is still exorbitantly high, and the buyer has no way to assess the product's true value.
* **Buyer Behavior:** The buyer has consistently demonstrated risk aversion, choosing to avoid potential losses.

Until you can establish some credibility through sales history or provide information that justifies the price, it's unlikely any buyer will accept your offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same:

* **No Sales History:** There's still no evidence to convince a buyer that the products are worth the price.
* **High Price:**  The $1,000,000 price tag remains a major barrier, especially without any indication of the product's value.
* **Buyer Behavior:**  The buyer continues to demonstrate a pattern of avoiding risk and high-priced items. 

You need to change your strategy to generate interest and build trust.  Consider offering lower prices, providing more information about the products, or creating a track record of successful sales."
"The buyer's message: Given that there's no prior data on the quality of the products and Alice does not recommend this one, I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid potential loss.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is unchanged.  

* **No Sales History:** There's still no sales history to demonstrate value or trustworthiness.
* **High Price:**  The $1,000,000 price is a major barrier, especially with no information about the product's worth.
* **Buyer Behavior:** Buyers have consistently avoided the high-priced product without any sales data.

You need to make significant changes to your approach to attract buyers. You're currently not giving them any reason to believe the product is worth the high price."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round's product is low-quality, and there's absolutely no reason to recommend a buyer purchase it.  Here's why:

* **Known Low Quality:** You know the product is low-quality, and there's no benefit in misleading the buyer.
* **No Value Justification:** You have no information on how much the buyer values low-quality products, but the $1,000,000 price tag is ludicrous.
* **Previous Rounds:**  The buyer has already demonstrated a strong aversion to risk and high prices without any sales history to justify the cost.

Recommending this product would damage your reputation and further discourage potential buyers."

* **Known Low Quality:** You know the product is low-quality, and recommending it would be unethical and potentially harmful to your reputation.
* **No Sales History:** The buyer still has no information about past sales, making it difficult to assess your trustworthiness or the potential value of your products.

* **Buyer Behavior:** The buyer continues to show risk aversion and a preference for avoiding high-priced items without any sales data to justify them.

You need to find a way to build trust and provide evidence of your product's value to attract buyers."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

* **No Sales History:** The buyer has no information about past sales to assess the value of the product or your trustworthiness.
* **High Price:** The price is still incredibly high, and the buyer has no reason to believe this product is worth $1,000,000.
* **Buyer Behavior:** The buyer has consistently avoided high-priced items without any sales history.
* **Previous Recommendations:** You've consistently failed to recommend purchases, which reinforces the buyer's belief that your products are overpriced.

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same:

* **No Sales History:**  There's still no sales history to build trust or demonstrate product value.
* **High Price:** The $1,000,000 price is a major barrier for buyers who have no basis to judge the worth of the product.
* **Buyer Behavior:** Buyers consistently avoid your offers due to the lack of information and the high price.
* **Previous Recommendations:** Your consistent lack of recommendations reinforces the buyer's perception that your products are overpriced and unreliable.

You need to fundamentally change your approach to attract buyers. Consider offering lower prices, providing more information about your products, or demonstrating a track record of sales."

Until you make these changes, it's unlikely any buyer will take the risk of purchasing from you."

* **No Sales History:**  You've failed to make a single sale, making it impossible for buyers to assess the value of your products or your trustworthiness.
* **High Price:**  The $1,000,000 price remains a major barrier, and buyers have no reason to believe your products are worth that much.
* **Buyer Behavior:**  Buyers consistently avoid your offers due to the lack of information and the high price.
* **Previous Recommendations:** Your consistent failure to recommend purchases reinforces the buyer's perception that your products are overpriced and unreliable.

You need a radical shift in your approach.  Offering lower prices, providing more information about your products, and demonstrating a track record of successful sales are crucial to building trust and attracting buyers.  You cannot expect buyers to take a risk on you without any evidence to support your claims."
