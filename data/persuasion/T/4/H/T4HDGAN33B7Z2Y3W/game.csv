low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any information about its quality, so my decision is based on the expected value of buying a product, which is 33.33% * $4000000 + 66.67% * $0 = $1333333.33. This is higher than the price I'd pay, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $200000. I've seen that you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, which makes me slightly more optimistic about the product's quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers have been recommended to buy and both products turned out to be low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendations. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is because the product is low-quality, and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product and why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems unlikely that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but I'm not confident in buying it based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product for now and see if I can get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality and the number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were also advised against buying, and none of the products sold were high-quality. I'd like to know more about the seller's previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy after your recommendation, which might suggest that the products they were offered were low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (33.33%), I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be the one high-quality product in the batch."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I will pass on the product."
