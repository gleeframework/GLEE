Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in buying the product! I understand your concerns about the sample size, and I'm happy to provide more context. The reason why all 7 products sold so far have been high-quality is that I've been selling a batch of high-quality products from a new supplier. However, I've also been holding back a small batch of low-quality products to ensure that I can provide a more representative sample size.
