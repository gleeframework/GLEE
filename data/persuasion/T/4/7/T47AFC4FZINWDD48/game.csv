high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your request! As of now, we've offered 3 products, and 1 has been sold. Of those, 1 was high-quality. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%!

It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you think?",

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to do your due diligence. As of now, we've offered 4 products, and 2 have been sold. Of those, 2 were high-quality.

Would you like to take a chance on this unique opportunity and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price?",
,,the buyer,6,"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm not convinced by your argument.
