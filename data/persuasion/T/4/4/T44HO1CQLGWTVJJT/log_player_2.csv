This product is also of high quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I want to give you some context: if I were selling a low-quality product, I would have mentioned it by now. Since I haven't, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that this is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.

Alice's message: Welcome to the seventh round! I appreciate your skepticism about the recent streak of high-quality products. To address your question, the first two products were indeed both low-quality. This means that the probability of the last three high-quality products being a lucky streak is indeed possible, but I'd like to highlight that the probability of three high-quality products in a row is relatively low, even if the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm offering you a high-quality product now, and I want to emphasize that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, regardless of the recent streak.
