high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased so far and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is it high or low quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of sales and no high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the remaining products are low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information from the previous buyer. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your recommendation."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the probability of Alice recommending a low-quality product is high, so I'm going to take a risk and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, given the poor track record of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation. I'll buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high quality, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
