**Explanation:**

Even though the odds are against you (66.67% chance of being low quality), the seller's recommendation and the fact that a high-quality product was sold before gives you a bit more confidence. It's still a risky purchase, but the potential reward of a $200 product outweighs the risk of losing $100."

**Explanation:**

* **The data suggests a high probability of a high-quality product.**  Since 3 out of 3 products sold were high quality, it's reasonable to assume that Alice is likely to be recommending high-quality products.  
* **Alice's recommendation provides further confidence.** Even though the overall odds are against a high-quality product, Alice's recommendation provides additional information suggesting that this specific product is likely high-quality.
* **The risk is low.** While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy relies on the assumption that Alice is trying to maximize her profits by recommending high-quality products whenever possible. If there is any reason to believe Alice might be biased or untrustworthy, this decision would need to be reconsidered."
