,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me another product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, and considering the low probability of high-quality products being sold, I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%.

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). This suggests that the current product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, and Alice does not recommend it, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
