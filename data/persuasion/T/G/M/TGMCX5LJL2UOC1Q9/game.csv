,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in our products. As you know, our products have a 50% chance of being high-quality. Since our previous buyer just purchased a product, I can share with you that 1 out of 1 product has been sold so far, and 1 out of 1 of those was high-quality. This gives you a good idea of our product's quality ratio. Considering this information, I'm offering you this product for $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to own a high-quality product?",
