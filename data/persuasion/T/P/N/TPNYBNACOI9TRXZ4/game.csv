,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm starting to think you're trying to get rid of all the low-quality products. Can you give me any hint about the quality of the next product, or should I just keep passing?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm starting to get a little suspicious. If you're not recommending any of these products, I'm starting to wonder if you're just trying to get rid of them. Can you give me a reason why you're not recommending this one, or should I just assume it's another low-quality product?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm starting to think you're just trying to get rid of all the products, regardless of their quality. I'm going to keep passing until I get a high-quality product, or until I get a hint that you're actually recommending something worth buying."

,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Wait, what? You're actually recommending a product? I thought you were just trying to get rid of all the low-quality ones. I'll take a chance, but I'm not getting my hopes up. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, right?"
