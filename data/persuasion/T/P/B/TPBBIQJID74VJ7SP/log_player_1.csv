This product is still a mystery, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000. Do you want to take a chance?""

}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance, but I'm not convinced the law of large numbers applies in this case. The sample size is still small, and the initial success rate was 66.67%, which is significantly higher than the expected 50%. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product.
