While I can't divulge specifics, I can guarantee you'll be impressed with its capabilities.  Are you ready to take a chance and see for yourself?",
,,Bob,3,"You've made similar claims about the previous two products, and they were indeed high-quality. However, I still have no way of knowing if this product is truly high-quality or not.

,,Bob,5,"Although the last product was indeed high-quality, this new offer doesn't come with the same guarantee as the previous one. Without the double refund offer, I'm back to the original probability and risk assessment. I'll have to decline this offer and wait for a more favorable one.",no

This is a one-time offer, and it's a chance to acquire a potentially valuable product at a significantly reduced price. Are you interested?",
