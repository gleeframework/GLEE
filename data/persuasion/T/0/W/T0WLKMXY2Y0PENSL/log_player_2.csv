"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, which brings the price down to $900000. However, if you don't buy it now, the price will go back up to $1000000, and I'll offer you another product in the next round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your caution, Bob. Let me propose a different approach. Since you're willing to wait, I'll offer you a 'lottery ticket' for this high-quality product.

However, if you buy the lottery ticket and the next product is also high-quality, you'll get to buy the current high-quality product for $950000, just like in the previous offer.

I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $980000, which is a $15000 premium over the original price of $965000 (the price difference between the original $1000000 and the $975000 you paid).
