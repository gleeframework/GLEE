As the seller, you know this product is high-quality.  Since the buyer is aware that 80% of your products are high-quality, there's a strong chance they'll perceive this product as valuable. Even if they don't know its exact worth, the high probability of it being high-quality makes it a good risk.  You should recommend the buyer to buy the product."

It's better to hold back and see how the buyer reacts to your silence."

*  It's best to continue withholding your recommendation.  The buyer is likely to be cautious and may require more convincing before they consider a purchase."

They've seen two low-quality products in a row and are increasingly suspicious. Recommending this product will likely lead to another negative outcome.  It's best to continue holding back and see how the buyer reacts to your silence.

* **Credibility:**  You've been silent for three rounds, which likely built some trust and made the buyer more receptive to your recommendation.
