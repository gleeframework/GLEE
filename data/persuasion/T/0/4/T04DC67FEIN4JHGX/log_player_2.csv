Alice's message: Welcome to our store! As you may know, our products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Since you're considering buying from us, I'd like to share that we've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and make this product yours for $10000? Keep in mind that you'll find out the quality of the product after the purchase, but I'm confident that this one has a good chance of being high-quality as well.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product! As of now, we've had 2 buyers and sold 2 products. Out of those, 1 product was high-quality.
