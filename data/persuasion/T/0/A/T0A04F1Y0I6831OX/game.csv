,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have rejected low-quality products, which would make me think the current product has a higher chance of being high-quality.
