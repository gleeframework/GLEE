,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the low quality of the previous products sold."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which means the sample size is too small to draw a reliable conclusion. I'd like to take the chance."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been 6 previous buyers, none of whom purchased a high-quality product.

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she doesn't know how much each product is worth to the buyer, and I'm trying to break the pattern. If you recommend it, I'll take it as a sign that it's high quality."
