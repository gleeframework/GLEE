Alice's message: I can tell you that the two buyers who purchased the high-quality products were very happy with their purchases. As for the one who bought the low-quality product, I'm not sure what they thought of it, but I'm sure they're enjoying it... in their own way. As for the third buyer, I'm not sure what happened to them, but I'm sure they're doing well. Anyway, this product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.
