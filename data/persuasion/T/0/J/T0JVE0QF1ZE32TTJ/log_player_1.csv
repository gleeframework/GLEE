"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
 
 You should recommend the buyer to buy the product. 
 
 Here's why: 
 
  * **High Probability:**  The product is high-quality, and the buyer knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality. 
  * **No Information Disadvantage:** The buyer doesn't have any information about the specific product's quality, so they are essentially making the decision based on the overall probabilities. 
  * **Potential Profit:** While the buyer doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential for a good deal exists. Even if the buyer values a high-quality product slightly below $1,000,000, the 80% probability makes it a worthwhile gamble. 
 
  However, it's important to note that:
  * **Risk is Present:**  There's still a 20% chance the product is low-quality, and the buyer would lose a significant amount of money. 
 
 This first round sets the stage for the rest of the game. As more rounds occur and the buyer sees your selling record, their decision-making will become more complex."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior information. I'm essentially making an uninformed decision based on your recommendation. I'll proceed with caution and hope for the best.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

You should still recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **No New Information:** The buyer's cautious approach and purchase in the previous round doesn't change the fundamental situation. You still have a high-quality product, and the buyer still has no specific information about its quality.
* **Similar Probabilities:** The buyer is now aware of your selling record: you've sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. This reinforces the 80% probability of high-quality products, making it even more attractive for the buyer.

The buyer's caution is a good sign, but it doesn't change the fact that the potential reward of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk, especially with the current high probability."
"The buyer's message: I would like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product first, and also I'd like to see more data on the previous sales record, such as the proportion of high-quality products sold, before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

You should still recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **No Change in Circumstances:** The previous buyer's demand for information doesn't change the fact that you have a high-quality product, and the buyer has no specific information about it. 
* **Potential for Growth:**  While the buyer wants more data, you can use this to your advantage.  The buyer's desire for more information suggests they are interested and might be willing to purchase later, especially if you can provide them with the data they want.

You should recommend the product, as you are in a favorable position to sell. You have a high-quality product, and the buyer seems interested. This is an opportunity to build trust and potentially make a sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should **not** recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Low-quality product:** This round's product is low-quality. You know this, but the buyer does not.
* **Buyer's request:** The buyer explicitly requested information about the proportion of high-quality products sold.  They are demonstrating that they are price-sensitive and want to make informed decisions.
* **Risk of Deception:**  Recommending a low-quality product would risk losing the buyer's trust.  This could lead to a negative reputation in future rounds.

You are in a difficult position. It's tempting to try and sell the low-quality product, but this is not the best long-term strategy. You'll need to find a way to navigate this request for data without jeopardizing your reputation."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far. I'll take the product and see if I get a high-quality one.
The buyer bought the product!

* **Buyer's risk tolerance:** The buyer has already purchased a product, demonstrating a willingness to take risks. They are likely aware of the probability of getting a high-quality product but are willing to gamble.
* **Building trust:**  You can use this opportunity to build trust with the buyer.  Recommending a high-quality product after the previous low-quality one will show that you are not trying to deceive them. 

While the buyer has shown a willingness to take risks, it's important to be transparent about your sales record if the buyer asks for more data. You can use this opportunity to build a stronger relationship with the buyer and increase the likelihood of future sales."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many buyers have been presented with low-quality products so far?

* **Risk of losing trust:** Recommending a low-quality product after this request would likely damage your credibility with the buyer. They might see you as trying to deceive them.

This is a critical point. You need to find a way to address the buyer's request for statistics without revealing that you have a low-quality product this round. This could involve being honest about the data, finding a way to deflect the question, or offering a different incentive to convince the buyer to purchase."
