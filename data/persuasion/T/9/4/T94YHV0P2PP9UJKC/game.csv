low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information to go on yet, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm not sure if the previous buyers were informed or if they were just following your advice."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you recommended it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given the seller's recommendation to not buy, I will also pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 3 buyers and 3 products sold, and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is low. Can you tell me the probability?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?"

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and the products they purchased?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to do so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality. The probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a high price."

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and I think the odds are still in my favor."

,,Alice,20,no,
