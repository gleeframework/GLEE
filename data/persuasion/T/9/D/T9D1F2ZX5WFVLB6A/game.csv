,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the probability is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm starting to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought, and I'm willing to take a chance to get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the probability of it being high-quality increases."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, please."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3 purchases, and you recommended me to buy the product, it suggests that the product I'm being offered might be of low quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me how many potential buyers have been offered the product so far, and how many products have been sold in total?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/3, which is very low. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still high. I'd like to wait for more information or for Alice to reveal the quality of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm curious about the likelihood of the product being high quality."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
