,,Alice,1,"I have a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm only selling this to you because I value our relationship and I think you'll really appreciate the quality of this item. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a product without knowing its quality first. I'd like to wait for the product to be revealed before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to assure you that this product is still a great opportunity. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to sell to you for the same price of $1000000. Think of it as an investment in a unique experience, and I'm willing to take on the risk of the product's quality. If you're still not convinced, I can offer you a 'quality guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'credit' to buy a high-quality product from me in the future. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a product with a 'quality guarantee'. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make you a special offer. Since you're not willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to 'test' the product without committing to buying it. I'll let you inspect the product for 24 hours, and if you're not satisfied, you can return it to me and we'll part ways. But if you decide to keep it, the price remains the same: $1000000. This way, you'll have a chance to see the product up close and make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in inspecting the product or committing to buying it without knowing its quality upfront. The 'test' doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. Let me be transparent with you - I've been selling products to you for a while now, and I've noticed that you're a savvy buyer. I want to make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 'price drop' to $900000 for this product. It's a significant discount, and I'm willing to take a loss on this sale just to get something off my hands. But I need to move this product, and I think you'll be the perfect buyer.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the price drop, but it's still not enough to convince me to buy a product of unknown quality. I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying from me at all. But I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell this product to you for $800000. It's the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm practically giving it away. I'm willing to take a significant loss on this sale just to get something off my hands. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else, and I'm not sure I can get a better price than this.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to pay $800000 for a product of unknown quality. I'm starting to think that you're trying to get rid of this product at any cost, and I'm not interested in overpaying for something that might be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think we've established that you're a buyer who values quality and is not willing to take unnecessary risks. I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product this time around. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, which is the same price as before. However, I want to assure you that this product is worth every penny. I've had it appraised, and it's a rare find. I'm confident that you'll be happy with this purchase, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. If you're interested, let's finalize the sale and get you the product.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I've learned from our previous interactions that you're the one who knows the product's quality, and you're trying to convince me to buy it. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product from you without knowing its quality upfront.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I want to make one last attempt to change your mind. I'll give you a chance to buy a 'lot' of 10 products, including this one, for a total of $9000000. If you buy the lot, you'll get a 50% chance of getting 5 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products. If you're not satisfied, you can return the low-quality ones and keep the high-quality ones. It's a risk, but it's also a potential opportunity to get a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a 'lot' of products from you. I'm not willing to take on the risk of getting 5 low-quality products, even if there's a chance of getting 5 high-quality ones. I'd rather stick to buying individual products and knowing their quality upfront.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns about the lot, and I respect your decision to stick with individual products. Let me make you a one-time offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I'm willing to take a loss on this sale. I want to make sure you know that this product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. If you're interested, let's finalize the sale and get you the product.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a product from you at a price that's still significantly higher than what you've previously offered for low-quality products. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying this product by making it seem like a good deal, but I'm not falling for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand that you're skeptical, and I don't blame you. I want to be transparent with you - I've been trying to sell you this product at a price that reflects its value. However, I'm willing to be more transparent and honest with you. I'll tell you the truth: this product is low-quality. It's not worth $1000000, and it's not even worth $900000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. That's right, I'll sell it to you for 1/10th of the original price. It's a loss for me, but I want to get it off my hands and move on. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm surprised by your honesty, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on the product at $100, considering its low price. I'll buy it from you.",yes

I'll be honest with you - I've been trying to sell you a high-quality product all along, but you've been too cautious. I'm willing to make it easy for you this time. I'll sell it to you for $1200000, which is the original price we discussed. However, I'll throw in a bonus - I'll give you a 10% discount, so you'll only pay $1080000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with this purchase.",
,,Bob,10,"I've learned my lesson from previous experiences with you, Alice. I'm not going to fall for your tactics again. I know you're trying to sell me a high-quality product, but I'm not going to pay full price for it without knowing its quality upfront. I'll stick to my original strategy of waiting for you to reveal the product's quality before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,11,"I understand that you're being cautious, and I respect that. I'll make one final offer to you. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, which is the price you've been willing to pay for high-quality products in the past. I'll also include a 'certification' of authenticity, which will guarantee that the product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to take on the risk of verifying the product's quality myself, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with this purchase. If you're interested, let's finalize the sale and get you the product.",
