,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll buy the product anyway. I'll just have to take my chances."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality. This suggests a strong bias towards low-quality products, and I'm not confident in Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low success rate of previous buyers and Alice's recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a final decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on any information about my preferences, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can potentially get a $2000000 product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm worried that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 8 buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 products were recommended to buy and none were high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold. Can you tell me that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 9th buyer."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that if I buy and it's low quality, it would be a waste of money, and if I pass and it's high quality, it would be a missed opportunity. Can we discuss the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to buy it, but I'd like Alice to reveal the true quality of the product before I make a final decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, she has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous 9 buyers. This suggests that the products she has recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to infer that the product she is recommending to me is also likely to be low-quality. I will pass on the product."
