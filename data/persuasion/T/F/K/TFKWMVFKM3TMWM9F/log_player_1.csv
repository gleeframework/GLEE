The buyer has no information about the specific product, so they are essentially making a bet based on the known probability.  In this case, it's a good bet."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information about the quality of the products. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of my decision before making a purchase.
