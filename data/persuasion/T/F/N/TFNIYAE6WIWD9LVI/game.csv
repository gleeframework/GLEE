high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (0.8).

high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is around 75%. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might be a low-quality one, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to test your recommendation system."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics. Based on the 5 previous sales, 3 were high-quality. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 3/5. With a 80% chance of high-quality products, I expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products. Since you recommended it, I'm concerned that you might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to pass and see what happens to the next buyer."
