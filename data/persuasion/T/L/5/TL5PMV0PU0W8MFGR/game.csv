,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the first high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the given 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

I'd like to know if there's any evidence to the contrary or if there's a pattern to your recommendation strategy."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the products despite Alice's recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I would like to pass on this product."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed, I'm starting to suspect that the products being offered are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the products, suggesting a high likelihood of low-quality products?"
