low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I've seen your recommendation, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know what the proportion of high-quality products sold is so far. Is it 0%?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product ended up buying it, and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products and none have been high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the products are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products turned out to be low quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a more neutral recommendation before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and break the streak of 0 high-quality products sold."
