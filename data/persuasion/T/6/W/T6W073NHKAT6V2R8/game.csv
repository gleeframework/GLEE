high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that 1 out of 1 product was not high-quality, so the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. I will wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it, and I think the probability of it being high quality is still quite high."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy, and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 80%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood that the current product is also low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm concerned that the recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if all products sold so far are low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm suspicious that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me suggests that it might be a low-quality product. Additionally, the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts so far suggests that the products Alice has been selling are likely to be low-quality."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80% as expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, and she may be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product.
