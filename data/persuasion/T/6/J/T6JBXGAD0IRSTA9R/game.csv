,,Alice,3,"You're right to be cautious, but let me offer a different perspective. I've now had two products that I was eager to sell, but the buyers didn't take the chance. I'm starting to think that people are underestimating the value I'm offering. I'm not asking you to trust me blindly; I'm asking you to consider the possibility that I'm offering something truly valuable. Don't let fear of the unknown hold you back from a potentially life-changing purchase.",

If you're looking for a potentially high-reward opportunity and are willing to take on the associated risk, then this might be the product for you.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice.
