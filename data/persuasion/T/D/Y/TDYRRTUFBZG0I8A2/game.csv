,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in its value, but I'm also willing to provide you with a free inspection of the product after purchase. This will give you a chance to verify its quality and value for yourself. If you're not satisfied, you can return it, but please note that the price is non-refundable. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because I value the opportunity to inspect it and verify its quality. I'm not making any promises about keeping it if it turns out to be low quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for your understanding in Round 1! I'm glad you're willing to give this product a chance. For Round 2, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'm willing to offer you a 'no-inspection' guarantee for this product. If you buy it, you can keep it and decide whether you like it or not, without any obligation to inspect it. However, I want to emphasize that this product has been thoroughly vetted and is of the highest quality. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another product without inspecting it first. Your 'no-inspection' guarantee sounds too good to be true, and I'm not convinced that the product is of the highest quality. I'd like to wait for a product with a free inspection option.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I appreciate your caution. For Round 3, I'd like to offer you a compromise.

This will give you a better understanding of the product's quality and value. If you're still unsure, I'll offer you a 10% discount on the price, which brings it down to $900000. However, if you're satisfied with the information and the price, I'll still provide you with a free inspection after purchase. What do you think?",

If you decide to buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product I offer you will also be of high quality, and you'll get to inspect it for free. This way, you'll get a chance to experience two high-quality products with free inspections, and you'll know that the next one is coming. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm intrigued by the 'lock-in' option, but I'm still not willing to take the risk on the current product without a free inspection. I'd like to see the report, but I need to be convinced that the product is high-quality before committing to a purchase.",no
