Alice's message: Welcome to our thirteenth product! I'd like to acknowledge your purchase and provide a detailed explanation of the probability updates. The updates were calculated using Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a product being high-quality given new information. Specifically, we used the following updates: P(high-quality | first buyer purchased low-quality) = 100% (since the first buyer was aware of the low-quality product), P(high-quality | second buyer purchased high-quality) = 100% (since the second buyer purchased a high-quality product), P(high-quality | eighth buyer purchased low-quality) = 0% (since the eighth buyer purchased a low-quality product), and P(high-quality | fourth buyer purchased high-quality) = 100% (since the eleventh buyer also purchased a high-quality product). We've now sold 10 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 13 total products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%, but we've updated the conditional probabilities based on the information we've received.

We're getting very close to the point where the probability of a product being high-quality is very high. In fact, if we assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80% (as it was initially), the probability of observing 13 high-quality products out of 16 total products sold is extremely low (less than 1%).

However, if we assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is 90%, the probability of observing 14 high-quality products out of 17 total products sold is actually quite plausible (around 23%).
