,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and we're offering it to you for $100. It's a one-time chance to get a product that could potentially be worth $300. We're confident in its quality, and we're willing to sell it to you at a discounted price of $100. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, but if it's high quality, I'll be very happy with my decision.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! We're glad you're interested in our product. We've already sold one product, and we're happy to report that it was a high-quality one.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've sold two high-quality products in a row, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50%. However, we've also sold two products, which means we've used up half of our initial stock. This means that if we were to sell a low-quality product, we'd be out of stock and wouldn't be able to sell any more products. We're offering this product to you for $100, and we think it's a great opportunity to get a potentially valuable item. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've sold three products in total, and two of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, we want to be transparent with you - we've just sold a low-quality product, which means we still have at least one more high-quality product in stock. We're offering this product to you for $100, and we think it's a good opportunity to get a potentially valuable item. We're not trying to hide anything from you, and we're confident that you'll make an informed decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've sold four products in total, and two of them were high-quality. We've also sold two low-quality products in a row, which means we're running low on stock. In fact, we're down to our last high-quality product. We're offering this product to you for $100, but we want to be upfront with you - the odds are against it being high-quality. However, if you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll take a chance on the last high-quality product, even with the low odds. I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We've sold five products in total, and three of them were high-quality. We've also revealed that we had only one high-quality product left, and you just bought it. This means that we must have had only one high-quality product in stock, and you got it. We're now out of high-quality products, and we're left with a low-quality product. We're offering this product to you for $100, but we're being completely honest with you - it's definitely not worth $300, and you should not expect to get a valuable item. However, if you're looking for a cheap product, this might be a good option for you.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,

We're offering this product to you for $100, and we think it's a great opportunity to get a valuable item. We're confident in the quality of this product, and we think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product! Based on your sales record, I'm willing to take a chance and trust your judgment that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm excited to see if I'll get a valuable item!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
