"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm only selling this one product to you at this price, so you have to decide now.

The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've sold you a high-quality product for $100, and I'm glad you're happy with it. This next product is also high-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value is $300. I'm only selling this one product at this price, so it's a one-time offer. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a higher price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to buy another high-quality product at the same price. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I'll give you a little more information. Since you passed on the previous high-quality product, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this one and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a $50 discount on the next high-quality product you buy from me. This way, you'll get a high-quality product for $50, which is an even better deal than before. So, what do you say?

Round 4
Alice's message: Great decision! You've got a second high-quality product, and you're one step closer to getting the $50 discount on the next one. Here's the deal: I'll give you the $50 discount upfront, so you can buy this high-quality product for $50. That's an unbeatable price, considering its value is $300. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to buy another high-quality product at this point.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about having two high-quality products. However, I'll give you a new offer. Since you've already passed on two high-quality products, I'll give you a'swap' option. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll let you swap it with any low-quality product you might get in the next round. This way, you can get a low-quality product and avoid having two high-quality ones. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That sounds like a good deal. I'll buy the product and take the swap option. I'll be able to swap it for a low-quality product if I get one next round.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: Great decision! You've got the swap option, and you're one step away from getting a low-quality product. However, I'll give you an even better deal. Since you've already bought two high-quality products and taken the swap option, I'll give you a 'lock-in' option. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll lock in the swap option for the next three rounds. This way, you can get a low-quality product in the next three rounds, and you'll be able to swap any of them. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the lock-in option. I'll buy the product and get the swap option locked in for the next three rounds.

If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a $200 refund on any high-quality product you return to me within the next three rounds. This way, you can get rid of one of the high-quality products and get a refund. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I want to buy another high-quality product at this point. I've already got three of them, and I'm not sure if I can use them all. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""}"
