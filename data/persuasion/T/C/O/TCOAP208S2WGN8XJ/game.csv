low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and she hasn't recommended any high-quality products so far, which might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still quite low. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the statistics. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
