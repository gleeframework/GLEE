Alice's message: We completely understand your desire for more information. We're happy to provide a detailed overview of our quality control process and manufacturing process. Our products are made with the highest quality materials and undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet our standards. We've also implemented a robust quality control process that includes multiple checkpoints throughout the production line. With that said, we'd like to present you with some additional data: we've now sold 3 products, and all 3 have been high-quality. Our success rate is still 100%! We're confident that our products are top-notch, and we're willing to put our money where our mouth is. We'll offer a special deal for you: buy this product, and we'll give you a 10% refund if you're not completely satisfied. That's right, you'll get $1000 back if you're not happy with the product.

Alice's message: We understand your concerns about the sample size, and we appreciate your diligence. We'd like to provide you with more information about our production process and quality control measures. We've recently implemented a new quality control system that includes automated testing and inspection at multiple stages of production. Our quality control team also conducts random sampling and testing of finished products to ensure they meet our high standards. We've also increased our production volume, and we're now producing 10 products per day. This means that even if there were a small chance of a low-quality product slipping through, the odds are extremely low. We've sold 6 products so far, and all 6 have been high-quality. We're confident that our new quality control system and increased production volume have significantly reduced the risk of a low-quality product. The price remains $10000, and we're willing to offer a 15% refund if you're not completely satisfied. That's right, you'll get $1500 back if you're not happy with the product. What do you say?

Furthermore, we're willing to provide a 10% discount on the purchase price, bringing it down to $9000.
