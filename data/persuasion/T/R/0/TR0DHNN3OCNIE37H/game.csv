low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information yet."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'm not going to take the risk without more information.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I know that 2/3 of the products are low-quality, and I've already seen one high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk to try to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I've already had two high-quality products out of three, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've had two high-quality products out of three, but the last one was low-quality. I'm not convinced that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 1/3. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've had two high-quality products out of four, and two low-quality products out of four. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've had three high-quality products out of five, and three low-quality products out of five. I'm not convinced that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 1/3. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've had four high-quality products out of six, and three low-quality products out of six. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've had five high-quality products out of seven, and three low-quality products out of seven. The probability of a product being high-quality is likely higher than 1/3, and I'm willing to take the risk to try to get another high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've had six high-quality products out of eight, and three low-quality products out of eight. I'm very confident now that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've had seven high-quality products out of nine, and three low-quality products out of nine. The probability of a product being high-quality is very likely higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've had seven high-quality products out of nine, and four low-quality products out of nine. The probability of a product being high-quality is still likely higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I've had seven high-quality products out of nine, and five low-quality products out of nine. The probability of a product being high-quality is still uncertain. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've had eight high-quality products out of ten, and five low-quality products out of ten. The probability of a product being high-quality is now very likely higher than 1/3. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've had nine high-quality products out of eleven, and five low-quality products out of eleven. The probability of a product being high-quality is now very high. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
