,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the quality before making a decision. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which is less than 50%. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see if you can provide more information about the previous sales. I'm curious to know the exact proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I think the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to consider the fact that I'm the 4th buyer and that she has recommended the product to me. I'm not convinced by her recommendation."
