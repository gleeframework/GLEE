"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it, but only if you can convince me that you value it at least $110. If you don't meet this condition, the price remains at $100.

I'll give you a chance to prove you're willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product.
