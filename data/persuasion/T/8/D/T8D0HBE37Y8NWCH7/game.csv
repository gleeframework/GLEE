,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased the product, and it was low quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and don't want to take the risk."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I don't have any information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation is not based on any knowledge of my valuation."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality. This makes me suspect that the previous products were all low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm not sure if that's due to the product's quality or the buyers' valuations. I'd like to take on the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
