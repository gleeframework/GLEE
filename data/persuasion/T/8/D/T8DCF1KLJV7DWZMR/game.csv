,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record. Based on 3 purchases and 0 high-quality products sold, I'd like to calculate the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
