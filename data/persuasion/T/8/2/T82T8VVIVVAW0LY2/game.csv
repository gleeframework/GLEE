,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're excited, Bob! However, I've got to be honest with you - this next product is not what I'd call a 'deal'. It's a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to get rid of it. I'm not even going to try to spin it as a good deal. I'll let it go for $0, but that's it.
