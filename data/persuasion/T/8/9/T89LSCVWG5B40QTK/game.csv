,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or your intuition?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially given that 5 previous buyers have also purchased and none of them got a high-quality product.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. However, the lack of sales after Alice's recommendation also raises a red flag. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
