,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that Alice is recommending it, which might mean it's low quality"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products and 2 out of 2 previous products were high quality?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/2 = 100%, which seems suspiciously high. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the high-quality products are already being picked by the first two buyers, so the remaining products are likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know why you recommended it, considering the statistics. If the previous 2 buyers purchased the products, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than 50%. I'd like to know if you have any information that suggests this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the first two buyers also bought the products and we only have a small sample size of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the previous 2 products, so I'd rather wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. I'm concerned that the next product might also be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the previous sales record, 2 out of 2 products were high-quality. I'm concerned that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 50%. However, since I'm the third buyer, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being low-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is available."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
