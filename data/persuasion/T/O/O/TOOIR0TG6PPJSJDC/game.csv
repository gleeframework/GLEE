,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and we're not sure if you'll like it. We've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. You know that 80% of our products are high-quality. If you're interested, we can make a deal for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,1,"Since 80% of the products are high-quality and I have no other information to go on, I'll take the chance and buy this product. The expected value of buying is $1000000 * 0.8 = $800000, which is less than the value of a high-quality product ($1250000), but still a good deal considering the probability.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 total product. Since the first product was low-quality, you know that this one is high-quality.

We think this is a great deal for you!",
,,the buyer,2,"According to the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which contradicts your claim that 1 high-quality product has been sold. Given this discrepancy and the fact that the first product was low-quality, I don't have enough confidence in the quality of the current product to justify the purchase.",no

,,Alice,3,"We've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 2 total products. We know that 1 out of the 2 sold products is high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. We're not perfect, but we're willing to take the risk with you. We're selling this one for $1000000. You know that 80% of our products are high-quality, so we think this is a good chance for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 4 total products. Our success rate is now 75%. We're on a hot streak!

Since our success rate is now higher than the probability of a high-quality product, we think this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.
