low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hey Bob, remember that full refund guarantee I offered you last round?  Well, it still stands! This product is just as good as the last one, but you can always get your money back if you're not happy. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I took a chance on your refund guarantee last time, but the product turned out to be low-quality. Given that you knew it was low-quality and still offered the guarantee, I'm not convinced you'll be honest about this product's quality either. I'll pass.",no
