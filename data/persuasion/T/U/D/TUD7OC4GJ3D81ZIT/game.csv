,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see some data before making a decision.

,,Alice,3,yes,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take that into account when making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers chose to buy the product recommended by you, which suggests that the products you recommended were likely low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that none of the previous products were high quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can learn from the data and potentially influence Alice's future recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyers were unlucky and the product is more likely to be high quality than the statistics suggest."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. This suggests to me that the product may be low-quality, and I'm hoping to get it at the discounted price of $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that since you've recommended buying to 9 out of the previous 9 buyers, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and would like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics. With 11 buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products is still 33.33%. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy it."
