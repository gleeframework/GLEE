I'm not going to sugarcoat it - my sales record is skewed, and I'm due for a low-quality product. I'm offering this one for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product. You know the odds, and I'm not hiding anything from you. What do you think?",

But, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a slight discount to $90, and I'll throw in a guarantee that I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you decide to buy it. What do you say?",

The one that wasn't was a low-quality product, which I was transparent about in Round 4. I've been upfront about my sales record and the odds, and I'm proud to say that I've maintained a high success rate. This one is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. You're getting a great deal on a $300 product. What do you think?",
