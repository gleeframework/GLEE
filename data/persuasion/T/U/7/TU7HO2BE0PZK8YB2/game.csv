,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, considering the 80% chance of it being high quality and the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers bought the recommended products."
