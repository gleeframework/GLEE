,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'd like to take a chance on the product being high-quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and none of the previous buyers have bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on the product."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, but the probability of it being low-quality is higher than 50% because we've seen a pattern of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
