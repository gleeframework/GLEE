high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products. Therefore, I'm taking a cautious approach and choosing not to buy this product."
