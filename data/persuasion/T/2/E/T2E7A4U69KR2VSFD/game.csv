high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, based on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not confident in the product's quality.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,"I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80%, and I have no reason to believe that this product is any different. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is just a matter of chance, and I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"I understand that the previous buyers were hesitant due to the lack of high-quality products sold so far. However, I assure you that each product is independent, and the probability of this product being high-quality remains 80%. In fact, the law of large numbers suggests that as we progress, the actual ratio of high-quality products sold will converge to the true probability of 80%. I'm confident that this product is a good opportunity for you."
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to see more data before making a decision.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. So far, 6 products have been offered, and none of them have been purchased or confirmed to be high-quality by the buyers, although I have assured that some of them were indeed high-quality. However, I assure you that this product is also high-quality, and the probability of it being so is still 80%. I believe it's a good opportunity, and I'm willing to let the product speak for itself. If you buy it and find it to be high-quality, it will be a great deal for you, and it will also help establish my credibility as a seller."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I want to disclose some information to you. In the first round, the product was indeed low-quality, but since then, all the products I've offered, including this one, have been high-quality. Although none of them have been purchased, I assure you that this product meets the high-quality standards. I believe it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you won't be disappointed."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and only one buyer has purchased a product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product has a higher probability of being high-quality.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I want to be transparent and provide you with more context. Since the first round, I've had 7 high-quality products in a row, but unfortunately, none of them have been purchased. The only product that was purchased was indeed low-quality, but that was just a matter of chance. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and the probability of it being so is still 80%. I believe it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you won't be disappointed. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I'd like to provide you with the statistics you're looking for. Out of the 9 previous products, only 1 was purchased, and it was indeed low-quality. However, I've had 8 high-quality products, including this one, that were not purchased. I understand that the lack of high-quality products sold might be concerning, but I assure you that each product is independent, and the probability of this product being high-quality remains 80%. I believe it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you won't be disappointed."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation, it seems unlikely this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next one will be of higher quality.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I'd like to address the previous buyer's concern. The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality is indeed a coincidence, but it doesn't change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality, which remains 80%. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I want to provide some context. Out of the 13 previous products, 2 were purchased, and unfortunately, both were low-quality. However, I've had many high-quality products, including this one, that were not purchased. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and the probability of it being so is still 80%. I believe it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you won't be disappointed. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think it's likely to be low-quality given the previous sales record.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I understand that the previous sales record might be concerning, but I assure you that each product is independent, and the probability of this product being high-quality remains 80%. In fact, I've had many high-quality products that were not purchased, and I believe this one is a great opportunity. I'm willing to provide a detailed breakdown of the previous products if you'd like, to help you make a more informed decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, considering the previous sales record.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I'd like to clarify that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you is still 80%, as each product is independent. However, I understand that the previous sales record might be concerning. To provide more transparency, out of the 15 previous products, 2 were purchased, and both were low-quality. Meanwhile, I've had 13 high-quality products that were not purchased, including this one. I believe this product is a great opportunity, and I'm confident that you won't be disappointed."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products, I suspect that the products Alice has left are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,
,,the buyer,18,yes,I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see its quality for myself.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. The previous two buyers purchased low-quality products, but that doesn't change the fact that this product is high-quality. I assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. I believe it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which would indicate that the next product is likely to be high-quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 0% success rate so far. Can you tell me more about the previous products and their quality?,
