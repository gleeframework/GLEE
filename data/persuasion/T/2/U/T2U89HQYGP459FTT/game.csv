,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' - if you purchase this product and it doesn't meet your expectations, I'll personally work with you to resolve any issues and ensure you're completely satisfied. Additionally, I'm willing to offer a special 'limited-time' discount of 1% off the original price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate the 'guarantee' and the 'discount', but it's just a low-quality product. I'm not going to fall for your sales tactics. I'll pass on this one.",no

What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I think you're trying to make up for the fact that the product is low-quality by offering me a bunch of extras. But the fact remains, I just lost $1000000 on a product that's worth $0 to me. I'm not falling for it again. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Bob,6,"Alice, you're really testing my patience now. A money-back guarantee is just a fancy way of saying 'you'll take it back if it's low-quality', which we all know is 50% likely. And what's this 'bonus' you're talking about? Sounds like just another way to try to sell me something I don't need. I'm not buying it.",no
