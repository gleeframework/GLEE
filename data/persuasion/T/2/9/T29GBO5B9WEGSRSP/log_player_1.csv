"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to discuss the pricing. If I were to buy a high-quality product, I'd be getting it for $100, but if I were to buy a low-quality product, I'd be getting it for $0. Given the 50/50 chance, it seems like I'm essentially paying $50 for the chance to get a product worth $120. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that risk. Would you be willing to consider a lower price point, or perhaps a different pricing structure that takes into account the uncertainty of the product's quality?

I understand that the 50/50 chance can be daunting, and I'm willing to listen to your concerns. Let me see what I can do. How about this: I can offer you a special deal for this high-quality product. Since it's a high-quality one, I'm willing to give you a 10% discount, making it $90. That way, you'll still get a great product, and you'll be taking less of a risk. What do you think? Is $90 a price you'd be comfortable with?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to think this through. Since I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet, I'd like to pass on this one and see how the sales record develops.
