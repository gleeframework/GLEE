Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. To be transparent, my manufacturing process involves a rigorous quality control check before shipping. However, I don't have any information about the specific product in front of you. What I can tell you is that I've sold 4 out of 5 products so far, all of which were high-quality. This is a strong indication that the product in front of you is also high-quality.
