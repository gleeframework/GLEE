,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since I have no information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm trying to collect more data for my decision-making process, not because I trust your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is suspicious. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's a 1 in 4 chance, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $100. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, and I'd like to take the risk of buying it myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, it seems like the products that were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you to buy the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. If I buy the product, I'll be left with a loss of $100. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not in my favor, and I'm trying to exploit the information that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0/7. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that will be discarded, and I'll get a better chance to buy a high-quality product in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than what the previous buyers' data suggests. Given the data, it seems like the previous 9 buyers were not very good at evaluating the quality of the products, so I'm taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision on my own. Can you tell me how many products have been sold so far, and what the proportion of high-quality products sold is?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it's likely to be low quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your reasoning behind the recommendation?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate of previous buyers and your recommendation not to buy. I'll take the product and see what I get."
