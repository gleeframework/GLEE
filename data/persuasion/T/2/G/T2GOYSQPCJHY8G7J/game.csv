,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on us in Round 1! As you've now experienced the value of a high-quality product, I want to assure you that our products are carefully curated and thoroughly inspected. This next product is a rare gem, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. However, I understand that trust must be earned, and I'm willing to offer a more transparent pricing structure. I'll sell it to you for $1100000, a 8.3% discount from its true value. I'm doing this to demonstrate my commitment to our business relationship and to show that we're not just about making a sale, but about building a long-term partnership.",

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. I respect your decision to prioritize our mutual interests. As you know, the previous product was a high-quality one, and I'm glad you got to experience its value firsthand. This next product, however, is a different story. I want to be upfront with you - this one is not as valuable as the previous one. In fact, it's worth significantly less to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, a price that reflects its true worth. I'm not trying to deceive you or take advantage of our previous experience. I'm offering you a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. However, if you're still unsure, I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with the product's value. What do you say?",

However, I also want to acknowledge that you may be hesitant to take on another high-value product after the previous low-quality one. To alleviate your concerns, I'm willing to offer a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $200000 on top of the purchase price. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund. This way, you have nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain. What do you say?",
