high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product already, and I have 19 more to go. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I should have sold at least 16 high-quality products by now. Since I've only sold 1, it's likely that the remaining products are mostly low-quality. I'm offering this one for $10000. If you're willing to take the risk, it might be a great deal. What do you think?",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, but I still have 16 high-quality products remaining.
