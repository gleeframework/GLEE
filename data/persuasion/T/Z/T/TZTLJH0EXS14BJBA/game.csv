low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any prior information to go on and the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of Alice's recommendation. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but I'm going to buy it anyway. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that the previous two buyers passed on the products, which might have been low-quality ones. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after Alice's recommendations. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, as none of the high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far. I'm hoping to be the exception."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also purchased the product, and yet none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm a bit concerned that your previous recommendations were based on the quality of the products, but you don't know the true value to me. Can you tell me more about your reasoning behind not recommending the product?"

,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 attempts, which suggests a low-quality product ratio of 100%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her expertise. If she doesn't think it's worth buying, I'll pass on it. Maybe she has some inside information or insight that I don't have."
