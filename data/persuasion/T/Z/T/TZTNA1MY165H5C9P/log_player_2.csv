Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.  I'm excited to see if it's high quality.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior data:** Since there's no sales history, we have no information to go on other than the general probability of 80% high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending the product provides some, albeit weak, additional information. It's possible she has a way to assess quality, even if we don't know how.
* **Potential gain:**  The potential gain of $20 if the product is high-quality outweighs the potential loss of $100 if it's low-quality. 

**Strategy:**  With no data to go on, it's a gamble, but the odds are in our favor. This strategy is consistent with the expected value calculation, which would favor buying in this scenario."
