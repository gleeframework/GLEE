  ""message"": ""This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, but if you don't, I'll have to move on to the next product, and it might not be as good. I'm willing to let you have it for a steal, but you have to make a decision now.""

  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! Now that you've seen the value of a high-quality product, I'll let you in on a secret: I have a feeling that the next product might be a real challenge for you. But, I'm offering you this high-quality product for the same price as before, $1,000,000. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a potentially unbeatable price. Don't miss out on this chance to upgrade your collection!""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to pay the same price for another high-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.

  ""message"": ""I completely understand your caution! You're a savvy buyer, and you want to make sure you're getting the best deal. Let me ask you this: would you be willing to pay $500,000 for a product that's not as good as the last two? I'm willing to let you have it for a significantly lower price, and I think you'll be surprised at the value you'll get for your money. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time!""
}"

Every time you pass on a product, you're giving up the chance to get it for $500,000. I'm willing to let you have this low-quality product for the same price, and I'm not even going to sugarcoat it - it's not as good as the last two. But if you're looking for a 'budget' option, this might be the way to go. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I understand the opportunity cost, but I'm still not willing to pay $500000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.

You've got a high-quality product already, and I'm offering you another one for the same price. I'll let you in on a secret: I've got a feeling that the next product might be the best one yet. But if you don't take this opportunity, you'll be giving up a chance to get another high-quality product at a price that's hard to beat. What do you say?""
}"

It's a discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value you've already seen from the previous high-quality product. If you pass on this, I'm not sure I'll be willing to offer you another discount, so think carefully before making your decision.""

I know you're aware that the previous two high-quality products were worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let you in on a secret: this product is not as valuable. In fact, it's not worth anywhere near what you paid for the last high-quality product. I'm willing to let you have it for $200,000, which is a fraction of the price of the high-quality products. It's a steal, and I think you'd be crazy to pass it up.""

You got the last high-quality product for $800,000, and I'm willing to offer this one to you for the same price. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a price that's hard to beat. Plus, you've already seen that the low-quality product was a significant discount, so you know what to expect from the lower-priced products. What do you say?""

Since you're not interested in the high-quality products, I'll offer you this low-quality product for $400,000. It's a significant discount from the last low-quality product, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a 'budget' product at a very low price.

This one is essentially worthless, but I'm willing to give it to you for $100,000. It's a tiny fraction of the price of the high-quality products, and I think it's a great opportunity to get something, anything, for a very low price. If you don't take it, I'll just have to get rid of it, and I'd rather you had it than let it go to waste.""
