,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,no,"Since Alice does not recommend the product and there's no previous sales record to rely on, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. Given that the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide additional insight into the product's quality, the expected value of buying the product is $600000 (50% of $1200000), which is less than the asking price of $1000000. Therefore, it's not a good investment to buy the product at this point."
