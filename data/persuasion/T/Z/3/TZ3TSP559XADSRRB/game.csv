,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality? Or is it just a general recommendation?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer also passed, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I don't have any information about the previous buyer's product quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I know Alice's recommendation is based on limited data and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your recommendation is based on the fact that you don't know the true quality of the product, and you're trying to keep me from buying it. I'm going to take the risk and buy it, just to see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can save $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely to be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a change in Alice's strategy before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather data to make an informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, which suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. If I buy, I'll be buying a product that's likely to be low-quality as well, which wouldn't be a good deal for me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if I buy and it's low quality, I'll lose $1000000, and if I pass and it's high quality, it will be discarded. However, based on the current statistics, it seems like there's a higher chance that the product is low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the probability of it being high quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the product, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
