low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality, but I still want to give it a chance to be the first high-quality product sold."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice is recommending it to me might be a sign that it's low quality, given that none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I've noticed that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm only interested in a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous purchases, and considering the 33.33% chance of a product being high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
