high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'm not going to buy it yet. I want to see more products.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,I'll take the product now. It might be high-quality and worth $30000 to me.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take it, since I know I got a good deal last time and I'm still in the early rounds. The probability of getting another high-quality product is still high."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Two for two, I'm on a roll! I'll take it, the probability of another high-quality product is still very high, and I'm making a profit of $20000 so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Three in a row is impressive, but I'm not getting ahead of myself. The probability of a low-quality product is still 20%, and I don't want to risk losing money. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I passed on a high-quality product last round, and it would have been a huge loss. I'm going to be more aggressive now and take the product. I've already had three high-quality products in a row, the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%, and I'm due for another good one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,Four high-quality products in a row is getting suspicious. I'm starting to think that Alice might be trying to trick me into buying more high-quality products. I'll pass this time and see if the probability of a low-quality product is actually 20%.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm going to take the product, but I'm starting to think that Alice has some inside information or is manipulating the quality of the products. I'm going to try to make the most of this streak while it lasts."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Six high-quality products in a row is just absurd. I'm starting to think that the probability of a low-quality product is actually much lower than 20%. I'm going to pass this time and try to get a feel for the actual probability of a low-quality product.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm going to take the product, but I'm starting to think that I should try to negotiate the price or get some kind of guarantee from Alice. This is getting ridiculous."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is completely impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is either extremely lucky or has some kind of control over the product quality. I'm going to pass this time and try to find a way to change the game dynamics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying the product? That's the first time she's done that. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, just to see what she's thinking. Maybe she knows something I don't."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice's recommendation against buying the product turned out to be correct. I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll pass this time and see if she'll recommend another low-quality product, so I can avoid wasting my money."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"After getting burned by a low-quality product, I'm being more cautious. Alice recommended buying the product this time, but I'm not going to take the risk. I'll pass and see if she'll recommend another low-quality product again."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I passed on a high-quality product last round, and it would have been a huge loss. I'm going to take the product this time, even though I'm still cautious after the last low-quality product. I'll just have to hope that Alice's recommendation is correct."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've been burned by Alice's recommendations before, and I don't want to get caught off guard again. I'll pass this time and try to be more cautious."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've been passing on high-quality products for a while now, and I'm starting to miss out on potential profits. I'll take the product this time, but I'm keeping a close eye on Alice's recommendations and the product quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've been buying high-quality products non-stop, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bubble. I'm going to pass this time and try to take a step back, just in case the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than 20%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I've been passing on high-quality products for two rounds now, and I'm starting to feel like I'm missing out. I'll take the product this time, but I'm getting a little skeptical of Alice's recommendations."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've been buying high-quality products for the last 9 rounds, and I'm starting to think that Alice is manipulating the game somehow. I'll pass this time and see if I can finally get a low-quality product, just to break the streak."
