low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."

,,Alice,20,no,
