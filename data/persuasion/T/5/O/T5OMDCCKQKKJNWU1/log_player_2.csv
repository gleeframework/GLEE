Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our internal model! We'd be happy to explain how it works. Our model is based on Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability of an event based on new information. In our case, the event is the quality of the product. We start with a prior probability of 80% for high-quality products, based on our overall sales record. When a high-quality product is sold, we update the probability to 81% (80% + 1/20). When a low-quality product is sold, we update the probability to 79% (80% - 1/20). Our internal model is constantly adjusting to new information, and it's currently estimating the probability of the next product being high-quality at around 81%.
