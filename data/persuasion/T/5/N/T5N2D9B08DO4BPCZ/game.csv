I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying, but I want to give you one more chance. I'll make it clear: this product is a low-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you're not interested, I'll stop offering it to you at this price.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to take a $10000 gamble on a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your perspective. I'll make it even clearer: this product is a low-quality item, and I'm willing to let it go for $5000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I'm hoping you'll consider it as a value proposition. If you're not interested, I'll keep the price at $10000 for the next round.",

,,Alice,7,"I've made it clear that this product is low-quality, and you've consistently expressed that it's not valuable to you. I'm going to take a different approach this time. I'll give you a chance to'steer' me towards a better product. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll immediately offer you the next product, which is likely to be high-quality. It's a 50/50 chance, but it might be worth considering if you're interested in getting a good deal on a high-quality item. Would you like to take the gamble?",
