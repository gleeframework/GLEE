high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products, but the last one was low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still high, but not as high as it was before. I want to be transparent with you: I've had a streak of high-quality products, and now a low-quality one. I'm not sure if this is a fluke or a return to the original probability of 50%.
