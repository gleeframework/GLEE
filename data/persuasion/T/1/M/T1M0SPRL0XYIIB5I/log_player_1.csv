Given the law of large numbers, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that my high-quality rate is still 80%. I'm willing to make a bold claim: if I sell one more high-quality product, I'll have sold 9 out of 10, which would be a strong indication that my high-quality rate is at least 90% or higher. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm taking a risk by making this claim. Would you like to take the chance and buy it?""}"

In fact, I'd say it's safe to assume that my high-quality rate is now above 90%. I'm offering you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not making any further claims about my high-quality rate. The data speaks for itself.
