Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more information about our selection process. While we strive to make the selection truly random, there is a small chance that certain factors might influence the outcome. For example, if a buyer has previously purchased a low-quality product, we might be more likely to offer them a high-quality product to make up for it. However, this is not a guarantee, and the selection is still largely based on chance. With that said, I want to be upfront with you that this round's product is actually a low-quality one. I know that's not what you were hoping for, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a product at a discounted price, and I think it's worth considering.
