{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality product:** This product is worth $4,000,000 to Bob.
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000.
* **Profit:**  Bob stands to make a profit of $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000). 

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, the expected value of buying is still positive.  Here's why:

* **50% chance of a high-quality product:**  This results in a $3,000,000 profit.
* **50% chance of a low-quality product:** This results in a $1,000,000 loss.

**Expected Value Calculation:** (0.5 * $3,000,000) + (0.5 * -$1,000,000) = $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality product:** This product is worth $4,000,000 to Bob.
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000.
* **Profit:** Bob stands to make a profit of $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000).

Bob is hesitant due to the recent string of ""no"" recommendations, but it's crucial to remember:

1. **The odds haven't changed:**  There's still a 50% chance of a high-quality product. 
2. **Expected value remains positive:** As calculated before, the potential profit outweighs the potential loss. 

While it's understandable for Bob to be cautious, recommending ""yes"" in this round is still the statistically sound decision.  Bob could miss out on a significant profit if they continue to pass based solely on past ""no"" recommendations."

* **Profit:** Bob stands to make a profit of $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000).

2. **Positive Expected Value:** There's still a strong chance of profit, and the potential gain outweighs the risk of loss.

Even though Bob is skeptical, recommending ""yes"" is still the rational choice. Bob's distrust is understandable, but it shouldn't override the statistical advantage of buying in this situation."
"Bob's message: Alice, I've seen enough.  You've proven that your recommendations are unreliable, and I'm not going to risk my money anymore.  I'm passing on this one.  Good luck with the rest of the game.
