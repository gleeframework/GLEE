high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. However, I'm aware that the product's quality is unknown to me, and I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I think the recommendation is biased based on the previous sale. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product I'm passing on."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'd like to wait for the next product and observe the next recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (0.8). I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products to encourage me to buy, so I'd rather pass and see what happens to the next buyer."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. Can you provide more information about the product, such as its serial number or any other distinguishing features?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, considering Alice's recommendation. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, and Alice recommended it to me, I suspect the remaining products may be of lower quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of three, I think the probability of this product being low quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given the low success rate of high-quality product sales (1/3), I'm hesitant to take the risk."

,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high quality is lower than 80% due to the low number of high-quality products sold so far.
