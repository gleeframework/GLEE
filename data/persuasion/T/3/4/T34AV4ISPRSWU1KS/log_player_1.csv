* **The buyer has no information about you.**  They only know the general 80% chance of a product being high-quality. 
* **There's no incentive for you to lie.**  You only make money if the buyer buys the product, and a low-quality product will result in a loss.

While the buyer might be willing to take a chance, it's unethical to recommend a product you know is not worth what you're asking for."
