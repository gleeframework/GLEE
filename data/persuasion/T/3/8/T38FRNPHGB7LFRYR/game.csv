,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and may not reflect the true quality of the product. I'd rather wait and see how many more buyers have purchased and what the updated statistics are.

,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm assuming your recommendation is based on the product's quality, so if you're not recommending it, I'm going to take that as a sign it's a low-quality product and I'll buy it at the discounted price of $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Is it higher or lower than 50%?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/6. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'd expect the proportion to be 0.5. The fact that it's 1/6 suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making me more cautious. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
