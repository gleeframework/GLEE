**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to work with. We only know one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This is not enough data to reliably assess the likelihood of this product being high quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend products, regardless of quality, because she earns money from each sale. This makes her recommendation somewhat suspect.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the chance of getting a low-quality product is higher, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) is significant. It's worth the risk in this case."
