**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice is recommending you buy the product.
* **The statistics:**  5 out of 6 products sold were high-quality, which is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. This suggests that Alice is able to identify high-quality products with a greater accuracy than random chance.
* **The Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $400 to you, and even if it's low-quality, the $100 price is negligible compared to the potential gain.
* **The Risk:** While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the high success rate of previous sales makes it worth the risk. 

Therefore, it's a good decision to purchase the product."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 6 out of 7 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation got a high-quality product (85.7%). 
* **Value Proposition:** Even if the product is low quality, it costs only $100 and has a potential value of $400 if it's high quality. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  The risk of losing $100 is outweighed by the potential gain of $300.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information provided. In reality, there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product even with a good recommendation."
