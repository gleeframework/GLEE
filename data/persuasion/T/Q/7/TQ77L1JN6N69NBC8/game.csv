low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer, as there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, and she's trying to maximize her profit. I'm essentially betting that the product is low-quality, and if it is, she wouldn't have recommended it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a pattern or strategy behind your recommendations?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not convincing, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher chance of the product being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one has to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, I'm inclined to think it's likely low-quality. Given the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but I'll err on the side of caution and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. If you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it for now."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers have all passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know if the 4 previous buyers were offered high-quality products or not."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
