,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to think for a moment. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. Given that 6 out of 8 products sold were high-quality, it seems that the actual quality of the products is higher than the expected 80%.
