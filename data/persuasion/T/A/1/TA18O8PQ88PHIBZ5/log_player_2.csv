Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous buyer. Let me assure you that I'm not trying to hide anything. However, I'd like to point out that you now have the benefit of knowing that my previous offer was for a low-quality product. That information might be useful in making a decision about this new product. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information to gauge the reliability of your recommendations. Given that the product's quality is still a 50-50 chance and the price is $1,000,000, the risk is too high for me to take. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious. I'd like to offer you some context: I've now had two consecutive low-quality products, and I've sold zero products so far. This might suggest that I'm not doing a great job of selecting high-quality products. However, I'd like to point out that the law of averages suggests that I'm due for a high-quality product. And, as it happens, this product is indeed high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance on it?
