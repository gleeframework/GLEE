high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on your past experience with other buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that the previous buyer was recommended to buy it and it turned out to be low quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not expecting much from it."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I don't think I should buy this product based on your previous recommendations.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers purchased and no high-quality products were sold, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,16,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This makes me more cautious and I'd like to wait for a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is very low. I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous 4 buyers were not recommended to buy, and none of them bought the product.
