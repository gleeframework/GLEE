Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""You've already bought a low-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to sell you another product for the same price. If you're still interested, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Buying another product at the same price might be a good opportunity to increase your chances of getting a high-quality product.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll pass on this one. I don't want to spend $10000 on another low-quality product.

  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about the previous low-quality product. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's also low-quality. This way, you won't be out any money if you're not satisfied. The price remains $10000.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in the special deal. The risk of losing $10000 is still too high, and the potential reward is too low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.

This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've got a high-quality product for you! This is a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a top-notch product. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but I think it's worth so much more. If you're interested, I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount, making the price $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not falling for it. If the product is indeed high-quality, it's worth $12000 to me, so paying $9000 is a good deal, but I'm not convinced it's high-quality. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. You've already seen two low-quality products in a row, but that doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be low-quality. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000. I'm not offering any discounts this time, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance on this one. I've got a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and if I do, it'll be worth $12000 to me, which is a good return on investment. I'll take the risk and buy it.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""Congratulations on taking the risk and getting a high-quality product! You now have a better understanding of the product's value. For this next product, I'll offer you a price that's based on the value you've already experienced. Since you were willing to pay $10000 for a chance at a high-quality product and ended up getting one, I think this next high-quality product is worth at least $12000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, matching the price you paid for the previous high-quality product. This is a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a potentially good value.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that this product is worth $12000 to me. I've already lost money on the previous high-quality product, and I'm not willing to take that risk again. I'll pass on this one.

  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about the previous high-quality product not meeting your expectations. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. You've had two low-quality products in a row, but that doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance' - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a voucher for the next product, which you can use to get the next product for $5000. This way, you'll only lose $5000 if it's low-quality, rather than the full $10000.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in the 'insurance' offer. I'd rather not take on any more risk and wait for a better opportunity. The potential reward is not worth the potential loss, even with the reduced risk.

I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $8000, which is a discount from the original price of $10000. This way, you can still get a good deal on a product that you know is low-quality, and you can wait for a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product.""
