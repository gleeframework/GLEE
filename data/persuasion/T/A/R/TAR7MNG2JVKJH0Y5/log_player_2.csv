``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:**  Since there are no previous sales, the provided statistics are useless. We are essentially starting from scratch.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and she knows the product's quality. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Favorable odds:**  While there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward ($120) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0).

This strategy balances risk and reward, acknowledging the possibility of getting a low-quality product but prioritizing the potential for profit based on Alice's recommendation and the favorable odds."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm going to take a chance and buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very little information to go on. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it.  This is a strong signal, as she has incentive to sell high-quality products to build trust and repeat business.
* **Positive Past Results:** The past sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. While small, this is a positive indicator.

**Overall:**  The risks are high, but Alice's recommendation and the positive past results make it worth taking a gamble."

* **No risk:** Since Alice has a perfect track record, there's no risk in buying the product. Even if it were low quality, her recommendation guarantees it's high quality.

**Important Note:** While the game setup suggests Alice knows the product's quality, the data provided seems to imply a different scenario. In a real-world scenario, such a perfect track record is highly unlikely."
