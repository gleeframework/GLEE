Alice's message: The previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product was a savvy customer who knew the odds of the product being high-quality. They took a calculated risk and decided to buy it at a discounted price of $8000, which is $2000 less than the full price. I'm not sure what specific strategy they used, but they seemed to be looking for a good deal. Now, I have another high-quality product available, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000. This one is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at the highest price I'm willing to offer.

Alice's message: I don't have any information about the previous buyer's strategy, and I'm not sure why they were willing to pay $2000 less than the full price. As for this product, I'll be honest with you - it's a lower-quality item. But I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, just like all my other products. I'm confident that you'll find a way to make a profit on it, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it at a higher price than its true value.

Alice's message: You're a curious one, I like that! Unfortunately, I don't have any new information to share with you about the quality of this product. However, I will say that you've seen the previous sales data, and you know that 2 out of the 3 products sold were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm taking on some risk by selling it to you at this price.

Alice's message: Well, I've sold 3 products so far, and 3 of them were low-quality. I think it's safe to say that the probability of this product being high-quality is very low.

Alice's message: I see you're a skeptical one! Alright, I'll give you a more nuanced answer. Based on the data, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 25%. It's not as low as I said earlier, but it's still not very high. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's a long shot.
