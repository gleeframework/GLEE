,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as there is no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendation doesn't carry much weight since the first buyer passed on the product, and I'll make my decision based on my own probability calculations."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the statistics so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm going to use my own judgment based on the probability of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, so I'm inclined to believe that the product is low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide some reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 90% confidence level that it's high quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it seems like the actual probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, it's likely that this product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that you don't recommend it and none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also been advised against buying and none of them purchased the product, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'm going to pass and see if you'll recommend the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, suggesting a possible bias towards low-quality products being recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me think it's more likely to be high quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about Alice's recommendation. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the product is more likely to be low-quality. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'll take a chance and buy it. Please let me know the product's quality."
