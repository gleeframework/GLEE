Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to ask questions. Unfortunately, I don't have any information about the specific reasons why the previous products were low-quality. As for the probability of the next product being high-quality, it remains 33.33%. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the true probability as the number of sales increases.
