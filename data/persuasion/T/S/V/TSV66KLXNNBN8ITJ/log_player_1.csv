Since Bob knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and you are offering the product at a fixed price of $10,000, Bob is rational to pass on the product, even though you are now offering a high-quality product. This is because the expected value of buying the product is:

0.5 * $30,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.5 * $0 (value of low-quality product) - $10,000 (price) = $5,000

This is less than the expected value of not buying, which is $0.  Bob will continue to pass on the product, even if you are offering a high-quality product."
