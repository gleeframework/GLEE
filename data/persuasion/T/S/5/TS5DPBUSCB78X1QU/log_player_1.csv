This way, you'll have nothing to lose and everything to gain. What do you say?""}"

You can think of it as an experiment or a learning experience. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this product?""}"

Are you willing to take a chance on this product?""}"
"Bob's message: I know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, but I also know that I've already had two chances to get a high-quality product and missed them both. I'm not going to take a chance on a third product without seeing its quality first.

You can think of it as a fun surprise or a little treat. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this product?""}"
