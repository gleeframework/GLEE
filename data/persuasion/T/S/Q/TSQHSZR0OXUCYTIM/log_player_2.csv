"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. It's a high-quality product, but I'm not sure if it's worth that much to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for a lower price if you're not interested. Please let me know if you'd like to buy it at this price.

Since you were willing to pay $1000000 for the first product without knowing its quality, I'm willing to offer you the next product at the same price of $1000000. However, I want to give you a bit more information to help you make a decision. If you're not interested, I'll be happy to provide more details.

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to highlight that the product I have this time is not high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's significantly lower than the high-quality products. Please let me know if you're interested in taking a chance on this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
