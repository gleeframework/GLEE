**Explanation:**

* **High Sale Rate:** The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality suggests a very high chance of the current product also being high quality. This is much higher than the overall 80% chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the case for buying. Even if the overall statistics were less favorable, Alice's recommendation would carry significant weight.

**Therefore, it's a good strategic decision to buy the product.**"
