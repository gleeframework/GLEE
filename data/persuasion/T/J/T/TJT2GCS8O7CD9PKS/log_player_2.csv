Alice's message: I've sold a total of 7 products, with 6 of them being high-quality and 1 of them being low-quality. Given the updated statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a product being high-quality.

We've seen 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which is a significant deviation from the expected 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability of a product being high-quality to approximately 0.92.
