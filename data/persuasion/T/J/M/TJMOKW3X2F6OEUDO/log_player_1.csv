"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As an AI, I am programmed to be helpful and provide the best possible advice. In this scenario, the product is high-quality, and the buyer is unaware of its quality.  Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, the buyer has no downside to purchasing the product if they believe it might be high-quality.  The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. Given the potential gain of a high-quality product, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to purchase it."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! Since there's no previous sales data, I'll trust your judgment and take a chance on the product. 
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality.  While the buyer doesn't know this, they now have access to some sales data: one sale, and one high-quality product sold.  Since the buyer doesn't know the value of a high-quality product to them, there's no guarantee they'd be happy with it, and they definitely wouldn't be happy with a low-quality product. Recommending a purchase in this scenario is risky and could damage your reputation. It's better to not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the low probability of the product being high quality and your recommendation against it, I will pass on this purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has even more information about your sales history: two sales, one high-quality and one low-quality.  This means your sales record is 50% high-quality, which is below the overall known probability of 80%. The buyer will likely be hesitant to purchase, especially since they don't know the value of a high-quality product.  Recommending a purchase of a potentially low-quality product at this point is unwise and could further damage your reputation. It's best to not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since you don't recommend the product, and the available data suggests a 100% chance of the previous product being high quality, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.

However, the buyer doesn't know the quality of the current product.  Recommending the purchase presents a chance for the buyer to get a high-quality product, which they might be willing to gamble on, especially since they now know there's a chance of getting a high-quality product. The buyer has no prior information on your trustworthiness.  Since the buyer has no way of knowing the quality of this specific product, recommending a purchase is still the best strategy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice!  Given the positive track record so far, I'm confident enough to buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
