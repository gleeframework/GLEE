,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'm making this decision based on the fact that there's no prior data to inform my decision, and I'm taking a chance."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that the first buyer also bought the product and it turned out to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer has passed on a product, I'm going to assume that the previous buyer's decision was influenced by the product being low-quality. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's previous recommendations have been so bad. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product despite the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far. I'm hoping to be the one to finally get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more information before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, and none of them purchased the product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high-quality seems low given the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the sales record so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have there been, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to me. I'll pass on this one."
