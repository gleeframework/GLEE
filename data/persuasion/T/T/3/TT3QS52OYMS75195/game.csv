high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on considering our product! As you may know, our products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Given the rarity of high-quality products, we're willing to offer this one to you for $10000. We're confident that you'll be impressed with its quality, and we're willing to take the risk of offering it to you at this price. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I believe the potential reward outweighs the risk. I'm not basing my decision on any information about the product's quality, but rather on the expected value of buying a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our store! We're glad to see another potential buyer. Since our previous buyer's decision was based on the expected value of buying a high-quality product, we'd like to share some information to help you make an informed decision. After selling 1 product so far, we've had a 1 in 3 chance of selling a high-quality product. Given this data, we think it's reasonable to assume that our next product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality as well. With that in mind, would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $10000, or would you like to wait and see what the next product is like?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm not making my decision based on the expected value of buying a high-quality product, but rather on the probability of the product being high-quality. I'm aware that the probability remains 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk.",yes

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our store! We're glad to see another potential buyer. After selling 2 products so far, we've had a 2 in 3 chance of selling a high-quality product.

,,Alice,4,"Thank you for considering our product! As you requested, our current statistics show that we've sold 2 out of 2 high-quality products so far, which is a 100% success rate. We're thrilled to say that our current product is also high-quality! We're confident that you'll be impressed with its quality, and we're willing to offer it to you for $10000. We believe that this product is a great value regardless of its quality because it's a rare and unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price. Will you take the chance and buy this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics. The sample size is too small, and I'm concerned that the 100% success rate might be a coincidence. I'd like to know more about the overall distribution of high-quality products in your inventory before making a decision.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,

While the sample size is still relatively small, we believe that this data provides a more representative picture of our product quality.

We're willing to take the risk of offering it to you at this price. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,9,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the 50% success rate is enough to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a fixed price of $10000. I'd like to see more data or a lower price before making a decision.,no
