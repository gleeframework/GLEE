high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a high-quality product from me, and if you do, it's worth $4000000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a 25% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, and you won't get another chance to buy at this price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product! I'm willing to take the risk for a 25% discount.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've heard that my previous product was worth a 25% discount, right? That means it was worth $1500000 to the previous buyer. I've sold one high-quality product out of three, so the chances are that the next product will be high-quality too. I'm offering you this product for $1000000, and I'm confident you'll get a great deal if you take it. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm not entirely convinced by your confidence in the product's quality. I'd like to negotiate the price a bit lower, considering the 25% discount the previous buyer got. Can we meet in the middle at $800000?",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a savvy negotiator! I like that. I can offer you a deal that's even better than meeting in the middle. Since the previous buyer got a 25% discount, and you're willing to take a risk, I'll offer you a 30% discount on the high-quality product. That's a price of $2800000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll be getting an amazing deal if you take it. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the offer! I think it's a great deal and I'm willing to take the risk.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on getting a great deal in the last round! You're now aware that I've sold two high-quality products out of four. The probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40% (2/5). However, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 35% discount, which brings the price down to $2600000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll be making a smart investment if you take it. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,I'm not convinced by your offer. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a cautious one, and that's good! Since you passed on the last offer, you've given me a chance to think about how to make the next offer even more appealing. I'll be honest with you - the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40%, but I'm willing to offer you a guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. That way, you'll only pay $1000000 if it's high-quality, and get your money back if it's not. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the offer, but I'd like to clarify the guarantee. Is it a full refund, or is there a small administrative fee involved?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"No administrative fee, I promise. You'll get a full refund of $1000000 if the product is low-quality. I want to make this offer as transparent and risk-free as possible. Considering the previous buyer just took advantage of the guarantee, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40% as well. I'll keep the same offer: buy this product for $1000000, and get a full refund if it's low-quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a thrill-seeker, aren't you? Well, I've got some bad news for you - this product is low-quality, and you won't be getting a refund. But don't worry, I'll make it up to you. Since you're the 6th buyer in a row who didn't get a high-quality product, I'll offer you a special deal. I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. That means you'll get the next product for $500000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll be getting an amazing deal if you take it. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your offer, but I'd rather pass on this low-quality product. I'm looking forward to the next product and the 50% discount you're offering. I'll take my chances and wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a patient one, waiting for the next product with the 50% discount. I respect that. However, I want to make it clear that the 50% discount is not a guarantee, and you'll still be taking a risk on the next product's quality. That being said, I'll give you a hint: the 50% discount is still on the table, but I'll make it even more appealing. If you buy the next product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next one, in addition to the 50% discount. That's a total of 70% off the next product's price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make sure I understand the offer correctly. If I buy the current product and it's low-quality, I'll get a 20% discount on the next one, making it 70% off the next product's price. Is that correct? And what's the current price of the product?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You got it right! If you buy the current product and it's low-quality, you'll get a 20% discount on the next one, making it 70% off the next product's price. And to answer your question, the current product is still $1000000. I'll give you a heads up that I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 8, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 38.46% (5/13). But don't worry about that right now, let's focus on the next offer. You can buy this product for $1000000, and if you do, the next product will be 70% off its price, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,I'll take the current product! I'm willing to take the risk for the potential 70% discount on the next product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're taking a calculated risk, and I respect that. Since you're the 7th buyer in a row who didn't get a high-quality product, I'll make you a deal. I'll give you a 60% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. That means you'll get the next product for $400000. I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 9, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 35.71% (5/14). But let's be honest, the real question is: are you willing to take a chance on a product that might be worth $4000000, or are you going to play it safe with the 60% discount? What do you say?",
,,the buyer,10,I'll take the 60% discount and hope for the best. I'm willing to take a chance on the product being high-quality and worth $4000000.,yes

But don't worry, you're not out of luck yet. Since you took the 60% discount, I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. That means you'll get the next product for $280000. I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 10, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 33.33% (5/15). But here's the thing: I've been selling products for a while now, and I think I've got a good sense of what you're looking for. I'm willing to give you a special offer: if you buy the next product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the product after you've seen its quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm not interested in the current low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product and consider the special offer you're providing. Thank you for the discount on the next product, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to negotiate the price if the next product is low-quality.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're a data-driven buyer, and I respect that. Since you've purchased the high-quality product, I'll give you a rundown of the sales record. Out of 13 products sold, 6 have been high-quality. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 46.15% (6/13). However, I want to make it clear that this product is low-quality. But don't worry, the 30% discount I offered to the previous buyer is still on the table.

I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 15, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40% (6/15). But I want to make it clear that I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' deal. If you buy the next product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.

But here's the thing: I'm running low on high-quality products, and I'm getting anxious to sell the last few. I'll make you a deal: if you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 5% bonus on top of the original price. That means you'll get a high-quality product for $3200000, instead of the usual $3000000. What do you say?",
