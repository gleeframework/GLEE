,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, but I've got a feeling that this one is different. I've sold a total of 3 products, and I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than you might think.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products, and 3 of them have been high-quality. However, I've just had a low-quality product in a row, which might indicate that my previous track record was just a fluke. I want to be transparent with you - my track record is now 37.5% high-quality products, which is actually lower than the initial probability. I'm not going to make any bold claims this time. I'll just say that I'm selling this product for $10000, and you can decide if you want to take the risk.",
