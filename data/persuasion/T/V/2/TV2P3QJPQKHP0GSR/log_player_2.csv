**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We have very little information about the product's quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which is valuable even if her expertise is limited.  
* **Potential Upside:**  A high-quality product is worth a significant amount, even with the risk of it being low quality. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Since the product is discarded if not bought, there's no risk of losing money from buying a low-quality product in the future. 

**This approach balances the risk of buying a low-quality product with the potential reward of buying a high-quality one.**"
