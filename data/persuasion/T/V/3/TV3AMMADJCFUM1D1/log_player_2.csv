Given the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and is priced at $100, which is below the value of a high-quality product ($120) but above the value of a low-quality product ($0), the expected value of buying the product is $60 (0.5 * $120 + 0.5 * $0). Since this is less than the price of $100, it's not a good bet.""}"
