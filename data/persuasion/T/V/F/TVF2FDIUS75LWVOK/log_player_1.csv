"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the expected value of buying is:

* 0.5 * $300 (value of high-quality product) + 0.5 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $150

This is greater than the price of $100, so it's a good deal for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! Since this is the first product and there's no information about previous sales, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is high-quality.** This is the key information.
* **The buyer has no information about previous sales.** This means they still only know the general probability of 50% for a high-quality product.
* **The expected value calculation remains the same as before:** 0.5 * $300 + 0.5 * $0 = $150, which is still greater than the price.

Therefore, recommending the buyer to buy is the best strategy."

The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is low-quality.** This is the key information.
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and that you have sold two high-quality products in a row.**  
* **The expected value of buying is now:** 0.5 * $300 + 0.5 * $0 = $150.  
* **However, the buyer is likely to be suspicious.** You've sold two high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely given the 50% probability. This could make the buyer believe there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product this time. 

Therefore, recommending the buyer to buy is risky. It's best to **not recommend the purchase** to avoid a negative outcome."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Given your recommendation and the fact that the sales history shows only high-quality products being sold, I'm hesitant to buy. I'll pass on this one.

* **The expected value calculation is still favorable:** 0.5 * $300 + 0.5 * $0 = $150, which is more than the $100 price.

While the buyer might be hesitant due to the previous round's low-quality product, the fact that this round's product is high-quality makes it a good deal for them.  Recommending the purchase is the best strategy to maximize our chances of selling."
