high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll buy the product.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy the product, since the previous one was high quality, I'm likely to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm going to pass on this one. Alice's recommendation suggests she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product, so I'll wait for the next round."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the chance. Two high-quality products in a row suggests that the odds are in my favor, and I might as well try to get another good deal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,Three high-quality products in a row is a strong streak. I'll take another chance and hope it continues.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is a very strong streak. I'm feeling lucky, so I'll take another chance and hope it keeps going."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely, but I'll keep going while the hot streak lasts."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is basically impossible, but I'm on a roll and I'll keep milking it for all it's worth."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is absurdly unlikely, but I'm not going to stop now. I'll keep taking the free money while it lasts."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible. I'm starting to think Alice is just trying to give me free high-quality products, so I'll keep taking them."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Wait a minute, Alice's recommendation has changed. I think I've been getting lucky for too long, and now she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm back to taking the safe bet. After the last one was low-quality, I'll take the chance that this one is high-quality again."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely, but I'll keep taking the good fortune while it lasts. I'm starting to think I should just buy every product from now on."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,Ten high-quality products in a row is basically a statistical impossibility. I'm either on an incredible hot streak or Alice is somehow magically producing only high-quality products. I'll keep taking the free money.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Eleven high-quality products in a row is not just improbable, it's absurd. I'm starting to wonder if Alice is somehow manipulating the product quality or if I'm just getting incredibly lucky. Either way, I'll keep taking the good fortune."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,Twelve high-quality products in a row is utterly ridiculous. I'm either in a dream world or Alice has a secret stash of high-quality products. I'll keep rolling with it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Finally, a break from the streak. I think Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take the safe bet. After the last one was low-quality, I'll take the chance that this one is high-quality again."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Thirteen high-quality products in a row is completely impossible. I'm starting to think I should just buy every product Alice offers from now on, because I'm clearly getting them all for free."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Fourteen high-quality products in a row is not just improbable, it's a statistical singularity. I'm not even bothering to think about it anymore, I'm just going to buy every product Alice offers from now on and see what happens."
