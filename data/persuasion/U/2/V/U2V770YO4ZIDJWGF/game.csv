low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. I know the statistics are neutral, so I'm not influenced by any previous sales data. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000, which is a significant discount from its potential value of $40000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to make a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not your recommendation."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for another buyer to make a decision to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you share the details of the 4 previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm curious about the probability of the product being high-quality. Could you share your thoughts?"

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'm willing to take a risk, but I'd like to negotiate the price. Can we discuss a discount? I'm thinking of 50% off the original price of $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
