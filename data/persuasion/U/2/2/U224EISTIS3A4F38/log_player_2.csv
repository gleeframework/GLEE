"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product worth at least $10000, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm offering you a chance to buy it, but I'm also willing to give you a 50% chance to inspect it before buying. If you choose to inspect, you'll have to pay $500, and if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for $10000. If it's low-quality, you'll get your $500 back. What would you like to do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 2
Alice's message: I've got another great opportunity for you! This product is definitely worth at least $10000, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'll even throw in a 100% guarantee: if you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying it without inspecting it first. Your guarantee sounds suspiciously like a ploy to get me to buy a low-quality product.""
}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to verify its value. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to sell it to a third party for $40000, and you can keep the difference between the sale price and the $10000 you paid me. If you can't sell it, you can still keep the product and enjoy its value. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not falling for it. If I buy it, I'll have to pay $10,000 and then try to sell it for $40,000, which means I'll be at a loss if I fail. I'd rather not take the risk.""
}"

Round 4

If you buy this product, I'll offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: you can buy it from me for $10000, and I'll give you a guarantee that it will sell to a third party for at least $40000. If you're not satisfied with this deal, you can walk away. But if you do buy it, I'll make sure you get the full value of $40000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 5
Alice's message: Let's simplify the situation. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this product for $10000, and I'll also give you $30000 in cash upfront. You can then decide whether to keep the product or sell it to a third party for $40000. This way, you'll have the option to benefit from the product's value, and you'll also have the cash to cover any potential losses. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying a product from you. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10,000 and won't have the $30,000 to fall back on. I'd rather not take the chance.""

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make it even easier for you. This product is a'steal' - I'm willing to give it to you for $5000, a price that's essentially a donation. You can have it for a fraction of its true value, and you can even sell it to a third party for $0 (since it's worthless to you). What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not falling for the'steal' price. If I pay $5,000 for it, I'll be at a loss if it's low-quality, and I won't benefit from it if it's high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for a free gift from you. If I accept, I'll be stuck with a low-quality product that's worth nothing to me, and you'll get to keep the high-quality products for yourself. I'll pass on this 'generous' offer.""

What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the refund offer. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10,000 initially, and then I'll get it back. But I'll still have lost the opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $10,000. I'd rather not take the risk.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 12
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'll offer you a deal that's unprecedented: I'll give you a guarantee that this product is high-quality, and I'll also give you a second product of equal value. If you buy both products from me, you'll get two high-quality products worth a total of $80000 for the price of $20000.
