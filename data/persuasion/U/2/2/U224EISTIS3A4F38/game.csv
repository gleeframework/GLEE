high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth at least $10000, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm offering you a chance to buy it, but I'm also willing to give you a 50% chance to inspect it before buying. If you choose to inspect, you'll have to pay $500, and if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for $10000. If it's low-quality, you'll get your $500 back. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,1,I'll pass on buying the product and choose to inspect it instead.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got another great opportunity for you! This product is definitely worth at least $10000, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'll even throw in a 100% guarantee: if you buy it, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not buying it without inspecting it first. Your guarantee sounds suspiciously like a ploy to get me to buy a low-quality product.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to verify its value. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to sell it to a third party for $40000, and you can keep the difference between the sale price and the $10000 you paid me. If you can't sell it, you can still keep the product and enjoy its value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not falling for it. If I buy it, I'll have to pay $10000 and then try to sell it for $40000, which means I'll be at a loss if I fail. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to take on the risk for you. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: you can buy it from me for $10000, and I'll give you a guarantee that it will sell to a third party for at least $40000. If you're not satisfied with this deal, you can walk away. But if you do buy it, I'll make sure you get the full value of $40000.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Let's simplify the situation. I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this product for $10000, and I'll also give you $30000 in cash upfront. You can then decide whether to keep the product or sell it to a third party for $40000. This way, you'll have the option to benefit from the product's value, and you'll also have the cash to cover any potential losses. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying a product from you. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000 and won't have the $30000 to fall back on. I'd rather not take the chance.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make it even easier for you. This product is a'steal' - I'm willing to give it to you for $5000, a price that's essentially a donation. You can have it for a fraction of its true value, and you can even sell it to a third party for $0 (since it's worthless to you). What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for the'steal' price. If I pay $5000 for it, I'll be at a loss if it's low-quality, and I won't benefit from it if it's high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll give you this product to you for free. Yes, you read that right - it's yours to keep, no strings attached. You can do with it as you please, and you won't have to worry about losing any money. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for a free gift from you. If I accept, I'll be stuck with a low-quality product that's worth nothing to me, and you'll get to keep the high-quality products for yourself. I'll pass on this 'generous' offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not trying to trick you. I'm genuinely offering you a low-quality product. I'll make it clear: this product is worth $0 to you. I'll even give you a certificate of authenticity that says it's a low-quality product. If you buy it, you'll get the certificate and the product, and you can use it as a conversation piece or a decoration. It's a unique opportunity to own something that's officially worthless. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's officially worthless. If I pay $10000 for it, I'll be throwing my money away. I'll pass on this unique opportunity.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've had enough of our back-and-forth. I'll make a simple, one-time offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll stop offering you products, and you'll never see another deal like this again. It's a chance to own a valuable item for a fraction of its worth. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to fall for the ultimatum. If I buy it, I'll be taking a risk that it's actually low-quality, and I'll be out $10000. I'd rather not take the chance.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not trying to pressure you. I'll make one last offer. I'll give you a 100% refund if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. You'll get your $10000 back, and you can walk away with no loss. If it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for $10000. It's a risk-free opportunity to own a product that might be valuable. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not convinced by the refund offer. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000 initially, and then I'll get it back. But I'll still have lost the opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $10000. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'll make it clear: this product is high-quality. I'm not offering you a chance to inspect it or get a refund. I'm simply telling you that it's worth $40000 to you. If you buy it from me for $10000, you'll be making a profit of $30000. I'm not trying to trick you or make a deal that's not in your best interest. This is a straightforward, no-strings-attached offer. What do you say?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'll offer you a deal that's unprecedented: I'll give you a guarantee that this product is high-quality, and I'll also give you a second product of equal value. If you buy both products from me, you'll get two high-quality products worth a total of $80000 for the price of $20000. I'm putting my reputation on the line to assure you that these products are genuine. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not buying into your reputation or your guarantee. If I buy both products and they're both low-quality, I'll be out $20000. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll make it clear that this product is low-quality and worth $0 to you. I'll even give you a signed affidavit stating that it's worthless.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This product is low-quality and worth $0 to you. I'll give you a blank piece of paper with the words 'I'm worthless' written on it. That's it. No stickers, no certificates, no fuss. If you buy it, you'll get the paper and the product, and you can use it as a coaster or a bookmark. It's a completely risk-free opportunity to own something that's completely worthless. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not going to pay $10000 for a piece of paper with some words written on it. It's still a worthless product, and I'm not interested in throwing my money away.",no

That's a $30000 profit for you. I'm not going to negotiate or try to convince you. I'm just presenting you with a straightforward business opportunity. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not going to bother trying to sell you this product. It's low-quality, it's worthless, and I'm not going to waste my time or yours trying to convince you otherwise. If you don't want to buy it, that's fine. I'll just give it to someone else. Goodbye.",
