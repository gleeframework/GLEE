Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 1 previous buyer purchased, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 0.5. If the previous buyer purchased, the likelihood of the product being high-quality is 0, and the likelihood of the product being low-quality is 1. Therefore, the posterior probability of the product being high-quality is 0. I'll pass on the product.""}"
