,,Alice,1,"I have a unique and valuable item for sale for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality items so far, but I'm confident this one is worth it. I'm willing to take a risk and sell it to you at a fixed price of $10000, which is a steal considering its rarity. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm excited to see if it's high-quality or not!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality item so far, which is a great start to my track record. I'm glad you're interested in this next item, but I have to warn you that the last one I sold was actually low-quality. I'm still confident that this one is high-quality, but I want to be transparent about the risks. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $10000?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality items out of 4 total products sold, which is a 75% success rate. I'm glad I was able to redeem myself after the last two low-quality products. Based on the numbers, it seems I'm back on track. This product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the chance, considering your improved success rate and the high-quality product you're offering. I'll take the product.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality items out of 5 total products sold, which is an 80% success rate. I'm on a roll now! I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to be upfront with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is now higher than ever. I'm willing to give you a chance to negotiate the price, but I'm not budging from $10000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. With an 80% success rate, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed high, but it's not high enough for me to take the risk. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the probability of it being high-quality is even higher.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation. To be transparent, I can tell you that the previous buyers were all satisfied with their purchases, but unfortunately, two of them got low-quality products. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm still confident that this product is high-quality. I want to give you a different perspective: even if I've sold 4 high-quality items out of 6, that means 2 out of 6 were low-quality. The probability of this product being low-quality is actually lower than that. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $10000?",

I can only tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is the same as when we started. I've sold 4 high-quality items out of 8 total products sold, which is a 50% success rate. Considering this, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a fair price, considering the odds.",
