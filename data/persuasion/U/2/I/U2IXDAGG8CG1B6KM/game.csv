,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even without your recommendation. I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two attempts, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that she's trying to get rid of."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering your previous recommendations have not been accurate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I know the probabilities. I'll take my chances."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the average. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems unusual that none of the first 4 buyers purchased a high-quality product, which has a 33.33% chance of being sold. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on it. The fact that 5 previous buyers also purchased the product and no high-quality products were sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making the product less valuable to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the previous 6 buyers passed on the product, I'm worried it might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer has better luck."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. Your recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many total products have been sold, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of those?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which show a very low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%, which is not negligible."
