**Reasoning:**

Since there is no historical data to go by, the best strategy is to trust Alice's recommendation. Even though there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $300 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product. This is a gamble, but it's the only way to get information about the product quality and potentially earn a profit."
