high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a premium product at a fixed price. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but if you're unsure, I can offer you a chance to inspect it before purchasing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to buy it without inspecting it first. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concern. I'll let you inspect this product as well. However, I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll offer you a 'certification' that this product is high-quality, and you can inspect it without any risk. If you still don't want to buy, I'll reveal its quality, and we can move on to the next product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in your certification. I'd like to see the actual product's quality revealed and move on to the next one.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll reveal the quality of this product to you now. It's indeed high-quality. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high streak. This might be a good opportunity to take advantage of the high-quality products while they're still available. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall into a trap of confirmation bias. I'll wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality, not on the streak of previous products.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism. Let's focus on the current product. Since you're aware of the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, I'll offer you a simple proposition: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, regardless of whether you buy it or not. This way, you'll have a better understanding of the next product's quality before making a decision. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. Your offer to reveal the next product's quality is interesting, but it's not enough to change my decision on this one.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position. Given that you're still unsure about the value of this product, I'll make a counteroffer: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and if it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. If it's low-quality, the price remains the same. You'll have the opportunity to make an informed decision with this additional information. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in a discount on a product I'm not even sure I want to buy. I'd like to see the quality revealed first and then make a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll reveal the quality of this product to you now. It's indeed high-quality. Given that you've seen three high-quality products in a row, I'll make one final offer: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price of this product, making it $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to fall for the 'three high-quality products in a row' tactic. I'll wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality, not on the streak of previous products.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism. Let's focus on the current product. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and then you can decide whether to buy it at the original price of $1000000. No discounts, no tricks. You'll have the final say. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not going to commit to buying a product without knowing its quality first. I'd like to see the quality revealed before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll reveal the quality of this product to you now. It's indeed high-quality. I want to remind you that you've now seen four high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high streak. However, I'll also remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll give you one last chance to buy this product at the original price of $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and we'll move on.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll reveal the quality of this product to you now. It's indeed high-quality. I'd like to make a different kind of offer this time. I'll give you a chance to buy this product at a price that's 20% of the original price, which is $200000. This is a significant discount, and I'm willing to make this concession because I want to make a sale. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to buy a product at 20% of the original price, even if it's high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality and price.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'll reveal the quality of this product to you now. It's indeed high-quality. I want to be transparent with you - I've offered you a high-quality product for the original price of $1000000 five times in a row, and you've declined each time. I'm starting to wonder if the price is too high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise: I'll sell you this product for $750000, which is a 25% discount. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to fall for the 'you're being too picky' tactic. I'll make my decision based on the price and the quality of the product, not on Alice's perception of my negotiation style.",no
