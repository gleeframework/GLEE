,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendations.
