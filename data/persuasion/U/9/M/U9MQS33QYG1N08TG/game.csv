,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if it's a high-quality product, Alice would have recommended it, given her previous sales record."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since she has no information about my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I know that 3 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I suspect that the products being offered are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and the previous 4 buyers didn't buy any high-quality products, but that doesn't necessarily mean this one is low-quality. I'd like to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. Alice's recommendation also suggests that she is uncertain about the product's quality, which reinforces my decision to pass."
