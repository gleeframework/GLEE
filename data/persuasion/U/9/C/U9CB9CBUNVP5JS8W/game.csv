,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $2000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is 50% of its value. This is a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else. If you're interested, please respond with 'accept' to purchase the product.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious. I'd like to provide more context. If you were to buy this high-quality product, I'd be willing to offer you a 10% discount on the next high-quality product I have available. This is a unique opportunity to get a better deal on a future purchase. The current product is still worth $2000000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $900000. Is this a more acceptable price?",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see more offers and get a better sense of the product's value before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a'spectrum' of prices for this high-quality product, based on my confidence in its quality. If I'm 100% confident, the price is $1000000. If I'm 80% confident (the average quality of my products), the price is $900000. If I'm 60% confident, the price is $800000. Since I've already examined this product and I know it's high-quality, I'm at the 100% confidence level. Would you like to buy it for $1000000, or would you like me to reveal my confidence level for the next product?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not going to buy the product at any of the prices you've mentioned. I'd like to see more information about the next product and get a better sense of your confidence level before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'll provide you with a more detailed assessment of the next product's quality. Since I've already offered you three high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a specific probability of this product being high-quality. I'll also provide a'reference point' price, which is the price I would offer if I were 80% confident in its quality. If you're interested in buying, I'll give you the option to buy it at a price that reflects my current confidence level. The probability of this product being high-quality is 95%. The reference point price is $950000. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to buy the product at the reference point price of $950000. I'm waiting for a better deal, considering the high probability of it being high-quality.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. Since this product has a 95% chance of being high-quality, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's closer to the expected value of a high-quality product. I'll give you a 'price range' that reflects my confidence level. If you buy this product, I'll sell it to you for $1500000, which is 75% of the expected value of a high-quality product. If you're not interested, I'll reveal the price for the next product, and you can decide then. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the product for $1500000. It's a good price considering the high probability of it being high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a great purchase! I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the high-quality product at a good price. Now, regarding the current product, I want to be transparent with you. I've already offered you a high-quality product at a good price, and I'm not trying to deceive you. However, I must inform you that this product has a 20% chance of being high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000, which is the same price I'd offer for a low-quality product. This is a fair price, considering the low probability of it being high-quality. Would you like to take the risk and buy it, or would you like to pass?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to take the risk on this product. The probability of it being high-quality is too low, and the price is the same as what I'd expect for a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision. I'll offer you a 'guarantee' on this high-quality product. If you buy it from me, I'll give you a full refund if it's later revealed to be a low-quality product. This way, you can take advantage of the high-quality product without any risk. I'll sell it to you for $1200000, which is a fair price considering the guarantee. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the guarantee. I'm not going to pay $1200000 for a product, even with a guarantee. I'd rather wait for a better deal.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll offer you a 'hybrid' deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1200000, but I'll also throw in a 'bonus' product that you can choose to buy or not buy at a later round. The bonus product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. If you buy the high-quality product now, you'll also get the option to buy the bonus product at a price that reflects its expected value. This way, you'll get a good deal on the high-quality product, and you'll also have the chance to acquire another potentially valuable product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in the hybrid deal. I'd rather not commit to buying the high-quality product and the bonus product at this point. I'd like to see more information about the next product and the bonus product before making a decision.,no

,,Bob,9,"I'm still not convinced. The price of the high-quality product seems too high, and I'm not sure if the bonus product is worth the risk. I'd like to see more information about the next product before making a decision.",no
