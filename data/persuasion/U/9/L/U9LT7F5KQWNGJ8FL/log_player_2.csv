I made a mistake in my inventory, and I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's essentially the same product you already bought from me last time. What do you think?

I've had great feedback from other customers, and I think you'll love it.

Keep in mind that it's a one-time deal, and I won't be offering any refunds or exchanges. What do you say?

I've already had to offer it to other customers and they've turned it down. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not worth much to me, and it's not worth much to you either.

It's taking up space and not doing anyone any good. I'll just go ahead and dispose of it myself.
