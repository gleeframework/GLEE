,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers' experiences and whether you have any insight into the current product's quality?

,,Alice,12,no,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you have not recommended me to buy the product, and the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on the product. The lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality, making it a poor investment for me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/6, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. Can you provide the probability of the product being high quality?"

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice.
