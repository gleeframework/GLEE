"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you have a high-quality product this round. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and there is no information to suggest otherwise, it is in your best interest to recommend the buyer purchase the product. There is a high chance the buyer will value the high-quality product at more than $10,000, making it a profitable sale for you."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take the risk and purchase the product hoping for the best.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though we don't know the buyer's valuation of a high-quality product, the information we have suggests a high chance of a successful sale. 

* **Previous Round:**  A high-quality product was sold in the previous round. This adds to the buyer's perception that you are a reliable seller of high-quality items. 
* **Probability:** The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This, combined with the positive outcome of the previous round, further increases the likelihood of a positive decision for this round. 

Therefore, recommending the purchase is still the best strategy, given the lack of information to the contrary."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your past performance, I am willing to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues.  You have now successfully sold two high-quality products. This further strengthens the buyer's perception of you as a seller of high-quality items.  There is no reason to believe this round would be any different.  It's in your best interest to recommend the purchase, given the available information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your feedback, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a low-quality product to sell. It's risky to recommend the purchase as the buyer has no reason to believe it's anything other than the usual 80% chance of being high-quality. You haven't built up enough trust to justify selling a low-quality item at this price. 

The buyer's previous purchases were likely influenced by the overall 80% chance, not specifically by your performance. Selling a low-quality product now could damage your reputation and lead to fewer buyers in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics provided, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you failed to sell the low-quality product in the previous round, it's important to remember that the buyer doesn't know the specific quality of each product. They only know the overall 80% chance of a high-quality product.  You've now established a track record of selling high-quality products. It's likely that the buyer will be more inclined to purchase this round,  knowing that the previous round's product was an outlier.  Recommending the purchase keeps the momentum of your successful sales going."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your positive feedback, I am willing to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've successfully sold 4 out of 5 products, but selling a low-quality product now would be a gamble. The buyer is likely to trust your track record, but it's still risky to sell a low-quality product for $10,000. There's a high chance the buyer won't appreciate it, and you could damage your reputation.  It's better to wait for a high-quality product to maintain your positive track record and build further trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```
