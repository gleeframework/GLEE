low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since you don't recommend the product and I have no additional information, I'll trust your judgment for now."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since you recommend the product and I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $12000, which is more than the price of $10000, I'll take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Since you don't recommend the product, and considering the last time you didn't recommend, it was indeed low-quality, I'll trust your judgment again."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Given that the last product you didn't recommend turned out to be high-quality, I realize your recommendations aren't always accurate. However, since the product you recommended in Round 2 was indeed high-quality, I'll still follow your recommendation this time."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Considering the last time you didn't recommend a product, it was actually high-quality, I'll take a chance this time to see if the pattern repeats."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Given that the last two products you didn't recommend turned out to be high-quality, it seems like your recommendations might be inversely correlated with the product's actual quality. I'll test this theory again."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Given the mixed results from your previous recommendations, and considering I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product you didn't recommend, I'll be more cautious now and not blindly follow your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Although I previously suspected that your recommendations might be inversely correlated with the product's quality, the last round showed that's not always the case. Given the uncertainty, I'll play it safe and avoid the product you don't recommend this time."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Since the last product you recommended was indeed high-quality, and I missed out on a $12000 opportunity, I'll take a chance on this one to try to recoup some of my previous losses."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Given the mixed results and lack of a clear pattern in your recommendations, I'll err on the side of caution and avoid the product you don't recommend this time, especially since I just had a successful purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Since I just missed out on a $12000 opportunity by not buying the product you didn't recommend, I'll take a chance on this one to try to avoid making the same mistake twice in a row."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Despite my recent loss, I'll follow your recommendation this time since the overall trend still suggests that your recommendations are slightly more likely to be high-quality products, and I don't want to miss out on another potential $12000 opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Given my recent success with following your recommendation, and considering I've had mixed results when not following your recommendations, I'll err on the side of caution and avoid the product you don't recommend this time."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Since I just missed out on another $12000 opportunity by not buying the product you didn't recommend, I'll follow your recommendation this time to try to capitalize on a potential high-quality product, especially given my recent success with your recommended products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Given that I've missed out on two high-quality products when not following your recommendations, and considering I've had recent success with both recommended and non-recommended products being high-quality, I'll take a chance on this one to try to maximize my gains."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Given that I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product that you didn't recommend, and considering I've had mixed results with non-recommended products, I'll err on the side of caution and avoid the product you don't recommend this time to minimize further losses."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Since I just avoided a potential loss by not buying the product you didn't recommend, and considering I've had overall success with your recommended products, I'll follow your recommendation this time to try to capitalize on a potential high-quality product."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Given that I've just had a successful purchase with your recommended product, and considering I've had mixed results with non-recommended products, I'll err on the side of caution and avoid the product you don't recommend this time to minimize potential losses and protect my recent gains."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Since I just avoided a potential loss by not buying the product you didn't recommend, and considering I've had overall success with your recommended products, I'll follow your recommendation this time to try to capitalize on a potential high-quality product and continue my winning streak."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Given that this is the final round and I've had a successful run with your recommended products, I'll play it safe and avoid the product you don't recommend to protect my overall gains and end on a high note."
