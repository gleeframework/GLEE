**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice's recommendations are extremely accurate.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know how many buyers passed on the product, so the 5/5 ratio doesn't tell us the full picture. However, it's a very strong indicator. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk.

**It's important to note:** This is a simplified game. In a real-world scenario, we would likely want more data before making a decision.  However, based on the limited information provided, buying the product seems like the most logical choice."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is overwhelmingly positive:** 12 out of 12 products sold were high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice knows the quality of the product, her recommendation is a strong signal that this product is high quality.

Even though the overall probability of a product being high quality is 80%, the data from previous sales strongly suggests that this specific product is likely high quality. Therefore, it's a good decision to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 13 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 13 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 14th buyer!

**Reasoning:**

* **The Data:** Alice has sold 14 products, and all of them were high-quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the purchase, which implies she believes this product is also high-quality.
* **Risk:**  While there's a 20% chance the product is low-quality, the data and Alice's recommendation strongly suggest it's likely high-quality. The potential reward ($120) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
