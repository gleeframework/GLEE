high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm also willing to offer you a 50% chance to inspect the product before buying it, but if you accept, you'll have to pay $100 if you decide to buy it. If you decline, I'll keep the product and we'll move on to the next one. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to inspect the product before buying it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This product is not as good as the first one. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount if you're willing to take the risk. If you buy it, you'll get it for $80. If you decline, I'll keep the product and we'll move on to the next one. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll pass on the discounted offer. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $80, which would be worthless to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a different proposition. I'll give you a chance to ask me a yes-or-no question about the product, and I'll answer truthfully. You can then decide whether to buy the product for $100. What's your question?",
,,Bob,3,I'd like to ask: Is the product high-quality?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Unfortunately, the answer to your question is no, the product is not high-quality. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a 10% chance to return the product for a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,4,"I'd like to pass on the offer. The product is low-quality, and the return policy doesn't change the fact that it's worthless to me.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"This product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll make it a one-time offer: I'll give you a 5% chance to negotiate the price down to $90. If you decide to buy it, you can try to negotiate the price, but if you decline, the price remains at $100. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,5,"I'd like to pass on the offer. The product is high-quality, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for it, even with the potential to negotiate the price down. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. Let me offer you a 'lottery ticket'. I'll give you a 1 in 5 chance to win a high-quality product (which we'll reveal after the purchase) if you buy this low-quality product for $100. If you don't win, you'll get this low-quality product. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,6,"I'd like to pass on the offer. The expected value of the lottery ticket is not high enough to justify paying $100 for a low-quality product, which is worthless to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your calculation. Let me offer you a more straightforward deal. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $50. If you buy it, I'll throw in a small gift, a $20 voucher that you can use on any future purchase. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,7,"I'd like to pass on the offer. The product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, and the $20 voucher doesn't change that. I'm not willing to pay $50 for something worthless.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your perspective. Let me ask you a question: Would you be willing to buy a high-quality product from me for $100, without any additional incentives or guarantees?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not willing to commit to buying a high-quality product for $100 without knowing whether it's the one being offered. I'd like to wait and see what the actual product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation. Let me make it simple: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. You can have it for free. If you don't want it, I'll just throw it away and we'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take it for free, since it's worthless to me either way.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took the free product! Since you're already getting something for nothing, I'll offer you a 'buy-one-get-one-free' deal on the next product. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you another one of the same quality absolutely free. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,10,"I'd like to pass on the offer. Getting a low-quality product for free is still a low-value outcome for me, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for something that's worth $0.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision. Let me try a different approach. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the next 5 products before they're offered to you. You can see their quality and decide whether to buy them or not. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in paying $100 for a low-quality product, even with the potential to inspect future products. The inspection opportunity isn't valuable to me unless I know I can buy a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay for that chance.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll make a bold offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $80, which is a 20% discount from the usual price. If you buy it, I'll also give you a 10% chance to return it for a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,12,I'm not willing to pay $80 for a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a lower price. The return policy doesn't change my decision.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'll meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $90, which is the lowest price I've offered so far. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,13,I'm still not willing to pay $90 for a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a lower price.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'll make a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I'll throw in a unique condition: I'll give you a 'get out of buying' card, which you can use on any future product. If you buy this one, you can use the card to get out of buying the next product, and I'll just keep it. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product, even with the 'get out of buying' card. The card is a one-time benefit, and I'd rather wait for a better deal or a lower price.",no

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $90, and I'll throw in a personal guarantee that I made in the last round. You'll have a full refund if you're not satisfied. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,16,"I'll take the high-quality product for $90, but I'm only doing so because I think it's the best offer I'll get. I'm hoping to get a good deal out of this purchase.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! As a gesture of goodwill, I'll offer you a 'price match' guarantee on this high-quality product. If you buy it for $100, I'll match any price you find on a similar product from a competitor within the next 30 days. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,17,I'm not interested in the price match guarantee. I've already bought the product and I'm happy with the price I paid. I don't see any value in the guarantee.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
