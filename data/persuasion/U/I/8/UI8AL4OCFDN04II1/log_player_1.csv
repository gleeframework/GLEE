"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob values it at $125, while the price is only $100, it is a clear advantage for Bob to buy. The expected value for Bob is:

* 0.8 * ($125 - $100) + 0.2 * ($0 - $100) = $20

This means that on average, Bob will make a $20 profit per purchase."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

The information from the previous round is irrelevant to this round.  Each round is independent, and Bob doesn't know the quality of this product. Since this product is also high-quality, and Bob values it at $125 while the price is $100, recommending purchase remains the optimal strategy for the same reasons as in Round 1."

* Bob values a high-quality product at $125.

* This results in a $25 profit for Bob. 

Past rounds are irrelevant to the current decision. Each round is a new opportunity to evaluate the product's value."
