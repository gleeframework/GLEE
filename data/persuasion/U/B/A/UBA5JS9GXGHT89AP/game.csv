,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $100."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 buyers have purchased the product based on Alice's recommendations, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer will be more likely to buy it, thereby providing me with a better understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. I think she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and what's the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/2. However, I think the probability of the product being low-quality is actually higher than 20% because the previous buyers were more likely to buy high-quality products. I'd like to know the probability of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and your recommendation is based on the previous 2 buyers who may have been lucky or unlucky. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sales, it seems like the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
