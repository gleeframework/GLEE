high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to pass on this product as well. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products offered so far might be low quality."
