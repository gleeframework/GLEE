high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see some data before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it blindly without any information. I'll take the risk and hope it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, especially since I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. However, I know that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one, hoping to get a better idea of the true proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the small sample size and the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation of the product.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to know the previous buyer's decision and the quality of the product before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the recommendation for the next buyer, so I can get a better idea of the proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you recommended it. If I had to decide based solely on the statistics, I'd probably pass because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 1/2, which is lower than the expected 4/5. However, your recommendation carries some weight, so I'll take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the exact number of products sold so far, and how many potential buyers have been presented with a product?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the overall 80% chance. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk based on the 80% chance of high quality and the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, indicating a decent proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she has an incentive to recommend the product to me. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to know what led you to recommend it to me. Is it based on the previous sales record or just a random guess?"

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the previous 5 products before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 4 high-quality products so far, but I'm not sure if this product is one of them. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product. I'd like to see the recommendation for the next product, which might be influenced by a more balanced pool of previous purchases."
