low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I've seen that you've recommended against it, which might indicate it's low quality, but it could also mean you're trying to manipulate the statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the low-quality products are more likely to be sold given the current statistics, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to reassess the situation and potentially wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product.
