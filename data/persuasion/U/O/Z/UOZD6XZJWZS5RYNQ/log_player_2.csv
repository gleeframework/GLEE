Alice's message: I've sold 0 out of 4 products so far, and I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. I want to share some information with you: I've had a chance to observe the market, and I've noticed that buyers are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products. I'm confident that if this product were high-quality, you would be willing to pay at least $1200000 for it. Considering the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a fair price considering the potential upside.

Alice's message: I've sold 1 out of 6 products so far, and I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. I'm glad to report that my first sale was a success, and I'm confident that this product is also of high quality. I've sold 1 out of 6 products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is now 16.67%. However, I believe that this product is worth much more than the asking price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll offer you a 20% discount on the next product I sell. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since the product only has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality initially and you've only sold 1 out of 6 products so far, I don't think the probability of this product being high-quality is now 16.67% as you've claimed. With the information given, the probability of this product being high-quality remains 33.33% for me. The guarantee you're offering for the next product doesn't change the fact that this product's expected value is $1,333,333 (33.33% of $4,000,000), which is higher than the asking price, but still a risk. I'll pass on this product.""}"

Additionally, if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll offer you a 25% discount on the next product I sell.
