high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, which might indicate that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but I'm also not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to avoid selling a low-quality product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products might have been low-quality. I'll pass on this product as well to see if Alice will reveal its quality."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous two buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, which makes me suspect that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of the high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I would like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation for your recommendation. I've noticed that you haven't sold any high-quality products so far, and I'm wondering if there's a reason for this. Is it possible that the products you've been offering are all low-quality?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I think it's likely that the next product will also be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product and that Alice does not recommend it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the true quality of the product and is trying to sell it to me. Given the statistics, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be of high quality, as there's a 33.33% chance of it being so. If I don't buy it, it will be discarded, and I might be missing out on a valuable opportunity. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."
