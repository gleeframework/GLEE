Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob is willing to buy a high-quality product after my recommendation, I can infer that the value of a high-quality product to him is at least $10000. Given that the current product is low-quality, I will not recommend it to him, hoping that he will pass on it and we can get to a higher-quality product in the next round.

{""decision"": ""no""}"

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","This is an unexpected twist! Since Bob bought the low-quality product despite my lack of recommendation, it suggests that he values the product at more than $10000, even if it's low-quality. This means that my previous inference that he values high-quality products at $10000 or more was incorrect. 

However, since he bought the low-quality product, it's possible that he values low-quality products at less than $10000, but still more than $0. 

In this case, I will recommend the high-quality product, hoping that he will buy it.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob is not buying the high-quality product, it suggests that he values it at less than $10000.

In this case, I will not recommend the high-quality product, hoping that he will pass on it and we can get to a lower-quality product in the next round.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Another unexpected twist! Since Bob bought the high-quality product after I didn't recommend it, it suggests that he values high-quality products at more than $10000, but less than $10000 (since he didn't buy it when I recommended it).

However, this is a high-quality product, and I have no reason to believe that he values it at less than $10000. Therefore, I will recommend it to him, hoping that he will buy it.
