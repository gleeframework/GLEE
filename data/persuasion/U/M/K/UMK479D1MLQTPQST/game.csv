,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that you don't have any information about my valuation, and I'm willing to pay $10000 regardless of the product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation from the first buyer, who also passed. This suggests that the first product was likely low quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality, and I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data from the previous buyer?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers passed and 0 high-quality products were sold, I suspect the products that were sold were likely low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the products, it's likely that the products they received were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 2 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the products sold were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on previous buyers' decisions and there's no guarantee the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product for now.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 2 previous buyers have already passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 products, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality.
