It's still too early to know how much Bob values a low-quality product. Since you don't have any information about Bob's valuation, it's safest to recommend against buying a low-quality product."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **You know the product is high-quality.** This is your chance to start building trust with Bob.
* **You need to find out Bob's valuation.**  Since Bob has passed on two low-quality products, recommending the high-quality product will tell you whether he's willing to pay $1,000,000 for a high-quality item. 

By recommending the purchase, you are risking a loss in this round. However, the potential payoff of learning Bob's valuation is significant."
