high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $40000 at a significant discount. I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $10000 when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product at a price that's still a significant discount from its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when another high-quality product will become available.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product for $12000 when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make you a special offer. I'll give you a 10% discount on the high-quality product, bringing the price down to $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another high-quality product available. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring you.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product for $11000 when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not going to give up on this opportunity. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell you the high-quality product for $10000, which is the original price I mentioned in the first round. This is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to let it go at this price. If you don't take it, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your persistence, but I've already turned down the same offer twice, and I'm not going to change my mind. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does. I'm not going to overpay for a high-quality product just to avoid the possibility of a low-quality one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to point out that waiting for a low-quality product is not a guarantee. In fact, the probability of getting a low-quality product is 20%. Meanwhile, I'm offering you a high-quality product that's worth $40000 to you at a price of $10000. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you, and I think it's a fair deal. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to the next buyer.",
,,Bob,5,"I understand your point, but I'm not going to change my strategy. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me, even if it's a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along and pay $0 for it, which is a 20% chance. I'm sticking to my plan.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand that you're sticking to your plan, but I'd like to point out that your current strategy is essentially a gamble. You're giving up a 80% chance of getting a product worth $40000 for a 20% chance of getting a product worth $0. I'm offering you a guaranteed high-quality product worth $40000 at a price of $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product (this one and the next one) for $20000. If you buy this one, I'll give you the next one for $20000 as well. This way, you'll be getting two high-quality products for the price of one.",
,,Bob,6,"I understand your point, but I'm not interested in buying two high-quality products for $20000 when I know I can get one for $10000. I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product worth $40000 to me. I'd rather stick to my original strategy and wait for a low-quality product to come along.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're still committed to your strategy. I'd like to make you an offer that's a bit different. I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, just like before, but this time, if you buy this one, I'll give you the next one for free. Yes, you read that right - free. If you don't buy this one, I'll just keep it and sell it to someone else. But if you do buy it, you'll get this one for $10000 and the next one for free. It's a risk-free opportunity to get two high-quality products.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product for $10000. Even with the promise of the next one being free, I'm not willing to pay that price for a product worth $40000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along and pay $0 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to point out that you've just missed out on a potential opportunity to get two high-quality products for a very low price. Now, I'm offering you a low-quality product, which is worth $0 to you. I know you're not interested in paying $10000 for a high-quality product, but I'm not going to give it away. This low-quality product is essentially free, and it's a chance for you to get something, even if it's not what you were hoping for.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the low-quality product. I know it's worth $0 to me, but it's better than nothing, and it's a chance to break the streak of missing out on high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took the low-quality product and broke the streak. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, which is worth $40000 to you. Considering you just got a low-quality product for free, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $15000. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring you, and it's a chance to get a high-quality product at a price that's closer to its true value.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $15000 for a high-quality product when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'm not going to pay a premium just because I got a low-quality product earlier.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to point out that you've now had two chances to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you've passed on both of them. Meanwhile, I'm offering you another low-quality product, which is worth $0 to you. At this point, it's essentially free. I'm not going to give you a good deal on a high-quality product, but I'm willing to give you this one for the sake of completing the transaction.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the low-quality product. I'm not interested in paying for it, but I'll take it to complete the transaction and see what happens next.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we could complete the transaction. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, which is worth $40000 to you. Considering you've already had two chances to get a high-quality product and passed on them, and you've now taken two low-quality products, I'm willing to meet you at the original price of $10000. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring you, and it's a chance to get a high-quality product at a price that's a significant discount from its true value.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $10000. I've already passed on it twice, and I'm not going to change my strategy now. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand you're sticking to your strategy, but I'd like to point out that you've now taken two low-quality products and passed on two high-quality products. You've essentially broken even, and now you're missing out on a third high-quality product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to get a high-quality product at the original price of $10000. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing. This is your last opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the warning, but I'm not going to change my strategy now. I've passed on high-quality products twice, and I'm not going to start paying full price for one now. I'll stick to my plan and wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand you're sticking to your strategy, but I'd like to point out that you've now taken three low-quality products, which means you've essentially spent $0 on a total of three products. Considering you've had multiple chances to get high-quality products and passed on them, I'm not going to offer you a deal on this low-quality product. It's simply $0, and you can have it for free. It's a chance to break the cycle and start fresh.",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the low-quality product. I've already spent $20000 on two low-quality products, so it's not like I'm losing anything by taking this one. I'll just take it and see what happens next.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you took the low-quality product. Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product, which is worth $40000 to you. Considering you've taken three low-quality products and spent a total of $20000 on them, I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000. It's a significant discount, and it's a chance for you to get a high-quality product at a price that's a fraction of its true value.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not going to fall for this offer. I've been burned by high-quality products before, and I'm not going to pay $8000 for one now. I'd rather stick to my strategy and wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no

You've essentially broken even, and now you're missing out on a fourth high-quality product. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $5000. It's a last-chance offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another high-quality product available. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not going to pay $5000 for a high-quality product. I've been burned too many times before, and I'm not going to start paying full price for one now. I'll stick to my strategy and wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.",no

I'm not going to offer you a deal on this low-quality product. It's simply $0, and you can have it for free. I'm done trying to convince you to take a high-quality product.

You've essentially broken even, and now you're missing out on a sixth high-quality product. I'm not going to make another offer or try to convince you to take this high-quality product. I'm just going to state the facts: this is a high-quality product worth $40000, and it's being offered to you for $10000. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing.",
