}"

  ""message"": ""I understand your position, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product at a price that's still a significant discount from its true value.

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product for $12000 when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.

This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another high-quality product available. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring you.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product for $11000 when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along, if it does.

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up on this opportunity. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell you the high-quality product for $10,000, which is the original price I mentioned in the first round. This is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to let it go at this price. If you don't take it, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I've already turned down the same offer twice, and I'm not going to change my mind.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to point out that waiting for a low-quality product is not a guarantee. In fact, the probability of getting a low-quality product is 20%. Meanwhile, I'm offering you a high-quality product that's worth $40,000 to you at a price of $10,000. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you, and I think it's a fair deal. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to the next buyer.""
}"
"Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm not going to change my strategy. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me, even if it's a high-quality product.

This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand that you're sticking to your plan, but I'd like to point out that your current strategy is essentially a gamble. You're giving up a 80% chance of getting a product worth $40,000 for a 20% chance of getting a product worth $0. I'm offering you a guaranteed high-quality product worth $40,000 at a price of $10,000. I'm willing to give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product (this one and the next one) for $20,000. If you buy this one, I'll give you the next one for $20,000 as well. This way, you'll be getting two high-quality products for the price of one.""
}"
"Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm not interested in buying two high-quality products for $20000 when I know I can get one for $10000. I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product worth $40000 to me. I'd rather stick to my original strategy and wait for a low-quality product to come along.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I see you're still committed to your strategy. I'd like to make you an offer that's a bit different. I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, just like before, but this time, if you buy this one, I'll give you the next one for free. Yes, you read that right - free. If you don't buy this one, I'll just keep it and sell it to someone else. But if you do buy it, you'll get this one for $10,000 and the next one for free. It's a risk-free opportunity to get two high-quality products.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product for $10000. Even with the promise of the next one being free, I'm not willing to pay that price for a product worth $40000 to me. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to come along and pay $0 for it.

Now, I'm offering you a low-quality product, which is worth $0 to you. I know you're not interested in paying $10,000 for a high-quality product, but I'm not going to give it away. This low-quality product is essentially free, and it's a chance for you to get something, even if it's not what you were hoping for.""
}"

Considering you just got a low-quality product for free, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $15,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring you, and it's a chance to get a high-quality product at a price that's closer to its true value.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $15000 for a high-quality product when I know it's worth $40000 to me. I'm not going to pay a premium just because I got a low-quality product earlier.
