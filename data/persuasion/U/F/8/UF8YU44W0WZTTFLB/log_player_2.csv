Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a breakdown of my sales record so far: 2 products sold, 1 high-quality product, and 2 low-quality products. I'd like to propose a 50/50 split on the price, so instead of $10000, I'll sell it to you for $7500. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'll still make a profit.
