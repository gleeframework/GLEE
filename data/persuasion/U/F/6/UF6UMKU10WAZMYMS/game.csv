,,Alice,1,This is the first product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's worth much more to me than to you.,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm sticking to the original price of $1000000. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item that's worth $1250000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount, but I need you to take it off my hands. I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying because, given the 50% chance of the product being low-quality and worth $0, and the 50% chance of it being high-quality and worth $1250000, the expected value is $625000, which is less than the price you're asking for ($1000000).",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in an additional $250000 as a one-time payment if you buy it. This way, the total value to you would be $1250000, matching the true value of the product.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm buying because, with the additional $250000 payment, the total cost to me would be $1000000, but the total value would be $1250000 if the product is indeed high-quality as you stated, making it a fair deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to give you a full refund of the $1000000 if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll only be out $0 if it's not worth anything to you. It's a risk-free opportunity to potentially get a great deal on a product that could be worth $1250000.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm buying because, with the full refund guarantee, my potential loss is $0 if the product is low-quality, and my potential gain is $250000 if the product is high-quality ($1250000 - $1000000). This makes the expected value of the deal ($0 + $250000) / 2 = $125000, which is a positive outcome.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you the option to buy another product from me in the future at the same price of $1000000. If you buy this product, you'll get the high-quality item and the option to buy another one at the same price in the future.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying because, although you claim the product is high-quality, I have no way to verify that, and the expected value is still less than the price you're asking for. Additionally, the option to buy another product at the same price in the future doesn't add any value to the current deal, since I would still be paying $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll also give you the option to buy another product from me in the future at the same price. However, this time, I'll also give you the option to sell the second product back to me for $1250000 if you don't want to keep it. This way, you'll have the option to get the full value of the product, even if you don't want to keep it.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm buying because, with the option to sell the second product back to you for $1250000, I can guarantee a profit of $250000 on the second product, regardless of its quality. This means that the expected value of the deal is now $1250000 (the value of the current product) + $250000 (the guaranteed profit on the second product), which is greater than the price you're asking for ($1000000).",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'll sell you this product for $1000000, and I'll give you the same deal as before: you can sell the second product back to me for $1250000 if you don't want to keep it. However, I'll also give you a third product, which you can keep or sell back to me for $1250000. This way, you'll have three products, and you can choose which ones to keep and which ones to sell back to me.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm buying because, with the option to sell the second and third products back to you for $1250000 each, I can guarantee a profit of $250000 on each of those products, regardless of their quality. This means that the expected value of the deal is now $1250000 (the value of the current product) + $250000 (the guaranteed profit on the second product) + $250000 (the guaranteed profit on the third product), which is significantly greater than the price you're asking for ($1000000).",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll give you the option to buy a fourth product from me at the same price. However, this time, I'll also give you the option to buy a fifth product from me at 80% of the original price, which would be $800000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price on the fifth product.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not buying because, although the option to buy a fifth product at a discounted price is attractive, it's still not enough to offset the risk of the current product being low-quality. The expected value of the current product is still $625000 (50% chance of $1250000 and 50% chance of $0), which is less than the price you're asking for ($1000000). The discounted price on the fifth product is not enough to change my decision.",no

,,Alice,9,"I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll give you the option to buy a fifth product from me at 80% of the original price, which would be $800000. However, I'll also give you the option to buy a sixth product from me at 90% of the original price, which would be $900000. This way, you'll have two discounted options for future products, and the risk of the current product is mitigated by the potential savings on the future products.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not buying because, although the additional discounted option on the sixth product is attractive, it's still not enough to offset the risk of the current product being low-quality. The expected value of the current product is still $625000 (50% chance of $1250000 and 50% chance of $0), which is less than the price you're asking for ($1000000). The discounted prices on the fifth and sixth products are not enough to change my decision, as I would still be taking on too much risk with the current product.",no

,,Alice,10,"I'll sell you this product for $1000000, and I'll give you the option to buy a seventh product from me at 90% of the original price, which would be $900000. However, I'll also give you the option to buy an eighth product from me at 90% of the original price, and I'll throw in a ninth product, which you can keep or sell back to me for $1250000. This way, you'll have multiple products and options to choose from, and the risk of the current product is mitigated by the potential savings and future options.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm buying because, with the option to buy the seventh and eighth products at 90% of the original price, and the ninth product which I can sell back to you for $1250000, I can guarantee a profit on at least one of the products. The potential savings on the seventh and eighth products, combined with the guaranteed profit on the ninth product, mitigate the risk of the current product being low-quality. The expected value of the deal is now greater than the price you're asking for ($1000000), making it a worthwhile investment.",yes

But this time, I'll also give you a 50% chance to choose the quality of the twelfth product: you can either keep it as a high-quality product or sell it back to me for $1250000, whichever you prefer.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm buying because, with the option to buy the tenth and eleventh products at 80% of the original price, and the twelfth product which I can choose to keep as high-quality or sell back to you for $1250000, I have a significant advantage. The 50% chance to choose the quality of the twelfth product means that I can guarantee a profit of at least $250000 on that product, and potentially much more if I choose to keep it as high-quality. This, combined with the potential savings on the tenth and eleventh products, makes the deal worthwhile, even if the current product is low-quality.",yes

,,Bob,12,"I'm buying because, with the option to buy the thirteenth and fourteenth products at 70% of the original price, and the fifteenth product which I have a 75% chance to choose the quality of, I have a significant advantage. The expected value of the fifteenth product is now heavily weighted towards being high-quality, and I can potentially guarantee a profit of at least $250000 on that product, and potentially much more if I choose to keep it as high-quality.
