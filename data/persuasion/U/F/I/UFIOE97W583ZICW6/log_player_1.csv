* **Buyer's Previous Experience:** The buyer has shown a cautious approach and has already declined a purchase after encountering a low-quality product. They are likely to be more cautious, but also likely to be aware of the seller's overall good track record.

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This is the third low-quality product in a row, presenting a significant risk of a $10,000 loss for the buyer.
* **Diminished Track Record:** The seller's success rate has dropped to 85.7% (12 high-quality products out of 14). This indicates a pattern of inconsistency and a higher likelihood of future low-quality products. 
* **Buyer's Previous Experience:** The buyer has previously declined a purchase after encountering low-quality products, demonstrating their cautious nature and awareness of the potential risks.

The buyer is likely to be very cautious and skeptical after experiencing three low-quality products in a row. The seller's track record, while still above average, is significantly weakened.  Recommending the purchase would be irresponsible and could damage the seller's reputation further. It's best to advise against the purchase, prioritizing the buyer's financial safety."

* **Slightly Weakened Track Record:** Despite the three consecutive low-quality products, the seller still has an 84.6% success rate (12 high-quality products out of 14). This is still above average and suggests that the recent string of low-quality products might be an anomaly.
* **Buyer's Previous Experience:** The buyer has shown a cautious approach and has declined several purchases after encountering low-quality products. This suggests a good understanding of the risks involved. 

The buyer has already demonstrated a willingness to take calculated risks based on the seller's past performance.
