``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no data on previous sales yet, the recommendation is the only information available. While the product has a higher chance of being low quality, it's still worth taking the risk since a high-quality product is worth significantly more than the price."

**Explanation:**

* **High Purchase Rate:** Two out of two buyers purchased the product, suggesting a high probability of it being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is incentivized to recommend high-quality products to increase sales and maintain a good reputation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $2,500 (the difference between the price and the value of a high-quality product) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

Therefore, buying the product seems like the best decision based on the available information."
