If you don't take advantage of this offer, I'll have to move on to the next potential buyer. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a complimentary service worth $10000. That brings the total value to $1010000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,2,The complimentary service doesn't change the fact that the product is worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for something I don't value.,no

I'll give you a chance to buy the product at a price that's closer to its true value. I'll meet you halfway and sell it to you for $2000000.

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a rough week, and I'm not as confident in the quality of this product as I was in the previous one. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly lower than usual, at $500000. I know it's still a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth considering, especially given the potential upside if it turns out to be a high-quality product.",

This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I think it's a deal you won't want to pass up.",
