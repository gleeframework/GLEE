Please consider this a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that I'm sure you'll find useful.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product at $1,000,000 when I only value it at $0 or $4,000,000. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product.""}"

If you don't take advantage of this offer, I'll have to move on to the next potential buyer. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a complimentary service worth $10000. That brings the total value to $1010000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The complimentary service doesn't change the fact that the product is worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for something I don't value.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement on the previous product, Bob. Now, I'd like to present you with another opportunity. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a rough week, and I'm not as confident in the quality of this product as I was in the previous one. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly lower than usual, at $500000. I know it's still a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth considering, especially given the potential upside if it turns out to be a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in taking a risk on a product that you're not confident in. I'd like to wait for a product that you're more confident in.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure why you're offering a discount on a high-quality product, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,800,000 for something that's worth $4,000,000 to me.
