,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is actually high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product without knowing its true quality. I'd like to pass on this offer and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, but I assure you that I'm offering you a high-quality product. I'd like to sweeten the deal by offering a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000. Additionally, I'll provide you with a detailed report on the product's specifications and features, so you can verify its quality for yourself. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount and the detailed report, but I'm still not convinced that the product is actually high-quality. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more assurance. I'm offering you a 'Quality Verification' certificate from a third-party organization, which guarantees that this product meets the highest industry standards. This certificate is usually only provided for high-quality products, and it's a significant added value. I'll send you a copy of the certificate, and I'm confident that it will alleviate any doubts you may have. The price remains at $9000, and I'm willing to throw in a 1-year warranty on top of the standard 1-year warranty, making it a 2-year warranty in total. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the added assurance, but I'm still not convinced that the product is actually high-quality. The certificate could be fake, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a discounted price. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to take on more risk to alleviate them. I'm offering you a 'Buy-It-Now' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's later found to be low-quality, I'll not only replace it with a new high-quality product, but I'll also give you a full refund for the original purchase price of $10000. This means you'll get a full refund, and you'll still get to keep the product. I'm essentially taking on the risk of selling a low-quality product, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality. The price remains at $9000, and I'm willing to provide you with a personalized demo of the product's features, so you can see it in action before making a decision.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a product without knowing its true quality. The guarantee is a good gesture, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't know if the product is high-quality or not. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to take it to the next level. I'm offering you a chance to inspect the product in person, at my location, before making a decision.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to take a different approach. Instead of trying to convince you that the product is high-quality, I'll make a prediction about the next product. I'll tell you that the next product will be low-quality. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you a special 'Early Bird' discount, bringing the price down to $8500. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also get to see the next product, which I predict will be low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure what to make of your prediction about the next product. If you're trying to manipulate me into buying this product, it's not working. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is, and make my decision based on its quality, not on your prediction.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

I'm offering it to you at the full price of $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to return it and get a full refund, no questions asked, after 30 days. This way, you can try out the product and see if it meets your needs, and if not, you can return it and get your money back. What do you say?",

I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being transparent about the product's quality. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let it go at a low price because I want to clear out inventory and make room for new products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. It's not worth anything to me, and I'd rather not waste my money on something that's not valuable. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
