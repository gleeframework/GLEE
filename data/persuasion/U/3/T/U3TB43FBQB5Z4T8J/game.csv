high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, but no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average, so I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I know it's a 33.33% chance, but the reward is worth it!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers did not find the product valuable enough to buy, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you're recommending it because it's low-quality or because you're trying to manipulate me into not buying it. I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, since the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying, based on your previous sales record, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'll wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I would like to pass on this opportunity and avoid potentially buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with the low recommendation from Alice. I'll buy the product and see if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Alice, I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's possible that you're just trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the probability of the product being high-quality given the statistics so far?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your previous recommendations have been spot on, and I'm curious to see if you're right again. If you're not recommending it, I'll pass."
