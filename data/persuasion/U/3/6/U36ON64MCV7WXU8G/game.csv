However, based on the information provided, there seems to be a discrepancy between your claim of selling four high-quality products and the statistics showing only three high-quality products have been sold. This inconsistency raises concerns about the reliability of the information. Given the 50% chance of the product being high or low quality and the provided statistics not aligning with your statement, I'm inclined to pass on this offer.",no

,,the buyer,12,"Hello Alice, I appreciate the information, but based on the statistics provided, it seems there might be a discrepancy in the information. You mentioned that out of the six products sold, four were of high quality, but the statistics I have indicate that only three high-quality products have been sold. This inconsistency raises some concerns for me. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality and my valuation of a high-quality product at $12000 and a low-quality product at $0, I need more reliable information to make a decision. Therefore, I will pass on this offer.",no

I understand there might have been some confusion about the previous product, but I assure you this is a valuable opportunity.  I'm committed to providing value and I stand by my record.  Would you be interested in learning more?",
,,the buyer,13,"Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but based on the statistics you provided and your sales record, it seems there's a discrepancy in the number of high-quality products sold. You mentioned selling four high-quality products, but the statistics indicate only three have been sold. This inconsistency raises concerns about the reliability of the information. Given the 50% chance of the product being high or low quality and the value of a high-quality product being only $2000 more than the asking price, I'm not convinced this is a risk worth taking at this time.",no

Would you be interested in learning more?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take my chances. The fact that 3 out of 6 products sold were high-quality doesn't provide a significant deviation from the expected 50% chance, considering the small sample size. Your assurance and the fact that this is a new, independent draw don't change the probability, but since the value of a high-quality product exceeds the cost, the expected value is positive, making it a worthwhile risk.",yes
