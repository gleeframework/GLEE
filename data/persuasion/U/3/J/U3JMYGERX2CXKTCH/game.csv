high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested! Unfortunately, I don't have time to go into details about the product's features, but I can tell you that it's a game-changer.

Trust your instincts and take the plunge. This one's a winner!",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to take a closer look at the statistics. With only 2 products sold, the sample size is quite small. I'd like to know more about the probability of a low-quality product being sold before making a decision.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Fair point, I understand your concern! With only 2 products sold, I can see why you'd want to know more about the probability.

That's a pretty strong indication that the next one will be just as good. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is - I'm confident you'll love this product! Why not take advantage of this chance to get a premium product at a great price?",

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've just had a slight setback. The last product I sold was actually low-quality. But don't worry, it's just a minor blip on the radar! The 80% probability still stands, and I'm confident that this next product will be a winner. You're getting a rare chance to get in on the ground floor of a great opportunity. Don't let one small setback scare you off!",

Plus, I've got a great feeling about this one. It's a game-changer. Trust me, you won't regret it. Are you ready to take the plunge?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm a bit skeptical. You've only sold 5 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That's not a very large sample size. I'd like to see more data before I make a decision. Can you provide more information about your sales record?",no
