"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, he should buy it. The expected value of the product is:

(0.3333 * $2,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $666,600

This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000, making it a good deal for Bob."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you know the product is low-quality, Bob does not. He still has the same information he had in round 1: the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  

The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.3333 * $2,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $666,600

This is still higher than the price, but Bob has already shown a reluctance to buy. He might be waiting for a higher probability of a high-quality product, or he might be hesitant due to the risk.  Recommending the purchase in this round would likely result in another rejection."
