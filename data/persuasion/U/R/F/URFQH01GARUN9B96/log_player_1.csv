"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of a high-quality product, it's always beneficial to recommend buying a high-quality product.  You have a 50% chance of the buyer valuing it highly enough to make a purchase, which leads to a profit for you."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and I have no other information to go on.
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

```

This is the first time you have a low-quality product. Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of a low-quality product, it's risky to recommend it.  There's a significant chance the buyer will be dissatisfied and you will lose the sale. It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend this product."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and given that all 4 previous sales were high-quality products, it suggests that Alice's recommendations might be reliable. Without additional information to contradict this pattern, I will follow Alice's recommendation and not buy the product.

Recommending a low-quality product would be a risky move as you are likely to lose the sale.  It's still better to avoid recommending the purchase."

You need to keep making sales to gain trust and potentially influence future buying decisions."
