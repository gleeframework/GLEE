"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to assure you that I have a 33.33% chance of selling you a high-quality product in the future, and I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy it at the same price. If you're not interested in buying this low-quality product, I'll keep it and you can try your luck in the next round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 2
Alice's message: You're right to wait for a high-quality product. I'll give you a slight nudge: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you an exclusive deal - I'll offer you a second product at the same price of $10000 in the next round, with the same 33.33% chance of being high-quality. This way, you'll have a guaranteed second chance to buy a high-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll sweeten the deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round, instead of the usual 33.33%. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available if you buy this low-quality product now. Think about it carefully, as this is a unique opportunity to increase your chances of getting a high-quality product sooner.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your strategy, and I respect it. However, I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll offer you a 'buy now, pay later' option. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 3-round 'high-quality guarantee'. If any of the next three products are high-quality, you can return this low-quality product and get a full refund. If none of the next three products are high-quality, you'll have to keep this product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're prioritizing minimizing risk. I'll make a bold statement: I'll give you a 1-in-4 chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round, if you buy this low-quality product now. If you don't buy, the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next round remains at 33.33%. This is a significant increase in the odds, and I'm willing to take on the risk to sweeten the deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the increased odds, but I'm still not willing to buy a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and avoid the risk of buying something worth $0 to me.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 7

Round 8
Alice's message: Congratulations, you've finally got a chance to buy a high-quality product! I'll remind you that this product is worth $10000, and you can't get a better deal than this. I'll also mention that you've already seen two low-quality products in a row, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is lower than the usual 33.33%. If you buy this high-quality product now, you'll be getting a great deal, and you can walk away with a valuable product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""Wait, I think there's been a mistake! You said I'd get to see the quality of the next product before buying it, not this one. I'm not buying this product, I want to wait for the next round to see if it's high-quality.""

Since you've already bought the high-quality product, I'll respect your decision. Now, regarding this low-quality product, I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll give you a 10% discount on the usual price of $10000, making it $9000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a low-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Since you're not interested in buying low-quality products, I'll ask you a question: if you were to get a high-quality product in the next round, would you be willing to pay $12000 for it? If your answer is yes, I'll offer you a deal: you can buy this low-quality product for $8000, and if the next product is high-quality, you can return this one and pay the difference of $2000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
