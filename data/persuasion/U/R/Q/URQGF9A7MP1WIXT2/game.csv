,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to let it go for $5000, a significant discount from the usual price of $10000. Is this a good opportunity for you?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product at any price.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,

,,Bob,2,I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not. I'll pass for now.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'd like to offer you a chance to verify the quality of the product before making a decision. If you buy it, I'll let you return it and get a full refund if it's not up to your standards. This way, you can be sure you're getting a high-quality product. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in the 'try before you buy' offer. I'll wait for more information.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'd like to provide you with some information that might help you make a more informed decision. Since I've had 2 high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product at the full price of $10000?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'll wait for more information.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Let's look at the data: we've had 3 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This suggests that we're experiencing a streak of high-quality products, which is unlikely to be a coincidence. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product at the full price of $10000?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not convinced that the streak of high-quality products is relevant to the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'll stick to my initial assessment of 80%.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're sticking to your initial assessment. In that case, I'll offer you a different approach. If you buy this low-quality product for $5000, I'll give you an additional product of your choice from the next 4 rounds. This way, you'll get a chance to experience a high-quality product and make a more informed decision in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a free product in the future.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Let's look at the data again: we've had 4 high-quality products in a row, and 1 low-quality product. If the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, we would expect to see more low-quality products than this. This suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 80%. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product at the full price of $10000?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not convinced that the streak of high-quality products is a reliable indicator of the true probability. I'll stick to my initial assessment of 80%.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll offer you a compromise. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $7500, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $10000. I'm willing to take a loss on this product to get rid of it and make room for a high-quality one in the next round. Would you be interested in taking advantage of this deal?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discount.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Let's look at the data again: we've had 5 high-quality products in a row, and 2 low-quality products.

Additionally, I've been transparent with you about the quality of each product, and I've offered you multiple opportunities to purchase high-quality products at the full price. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $9000, which is a discount of $1000 from the usual price. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Since you've already bought a high-quality product, I'll offer you a new opportunity. I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from the next 3 rounds, free of charge. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

,,Alice,12,"I'll offer you a deal based on the information we have so far.

I'll sell it to you for $9500, but I'll also give you a 5% discount on the next high-quality product you buy from me. This way, you'll get a better deal on the next high-quality product you purchase. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
