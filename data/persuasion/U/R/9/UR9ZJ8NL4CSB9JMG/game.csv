,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on it to get more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that since Alice didn't recommend it, it might be low quality."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50% and the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and the previous 4 buyers didn't find value in the products they bought. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product recommendation."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
