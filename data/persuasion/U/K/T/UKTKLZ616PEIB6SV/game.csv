,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the next round! I'd like to remind you that the two previous products sold were both high-quality, which might lead you to think that this product is also high-quality.

I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the fact that 4 out of 6 products were high-quality is actually above this expected value. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Would you like to take a closer look and consider the potential risks?",
