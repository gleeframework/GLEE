I want to assure you that they were offered to previous buyers, but unfortunately, those buyers chose not to purchase them. I don't have any hidden inventory or set-aside products.

All 10 products have been high-quality. I'm confident that this product meets the high standards I've established, and I believe the $1000000 price tag is fair for the quality you're getting.""}"
