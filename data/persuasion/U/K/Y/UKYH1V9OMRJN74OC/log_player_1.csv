Here's why:

* **Buyer's Behavior:** The buyer has consistently bought all previous products, demonstrating a willingness to trust the seller's recommendations. They are likely to buy based on the track record of high-quality sales.
* **Hidden Information:** Alice knows the product is low-quality but the buyer doesn't.  Alice has no incentive to be truthful to the buyer.  Alice is incentivized to sell as many products as possible, regardless of quality.

Therefore, Alice should still recommend the product. The buyer's past behavior suggests they will buy regardless of Alice's honesty."
