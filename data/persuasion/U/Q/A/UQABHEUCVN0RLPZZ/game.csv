,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of getting a high-quality product. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you have any information about the quality of the product, but I'll take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the number of total products sold, to help me make a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I need more information about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I'd like to understand your thought process.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision, and I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the low recommendation rate so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 5 buyers purchased the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first 5 buyers didn't know the quality of the product, so she has no information about the actual quality. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what the product's quality is, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics."
