Since you've already experienced a high-quality product, I'll give you a more nuanced description. This product is actually one of the lower-end products I have available, but it still has some redeeming qualities. It's not as good as the product you bought earlier, but it's still a decent option. I'm offering it to you for $100, the standard price. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
