,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm skeptical about buying. I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
