The expected value of this product is still negative for me, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your stance, Bob. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that this low-quality product has a unique historical significance?

It's a chance to own a piece of the past and potentially increase your social standing. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the historical significance, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $600,000 to me.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your stance, Bob. Let me ask you this: are you willing to take a chance on a mystery box?

You won't know which one is which until after you've bought both. I'll sell it to you for $800000. It's a chance to take a calculated risk and potentially get a high-quality product, or at least get two products that might be worth something to you. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're trying to entice me with a mystery box, but I'm not falling for it. Buying two unknown products for $800,000 is still a bad deal for me, and I'm not willing to take on that level of risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the pitch, but I'm not convinced. As it stands, the product is worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $400,000 for the potential of a future technology.
