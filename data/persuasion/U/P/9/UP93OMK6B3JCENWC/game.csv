low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 total products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. You might want to consider the fact that I've sold two products in a row that aren't high-quality, which is a bit unusual given the 50% probability. Maybe I'm just having a bad streak?",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism. I want to be transparent with you - I've been having a tough streak lately, and I'm not sure what's causing it. However, I can tell you that this product is a completely separate unit from the previous ones, and it's been stored in a different location. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping this one will break the streak.",

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are against it being high-quality.",

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not even sure if I have any high-quality products left in stock. It's a long shot, but if you're feeling desperate, I'll sell it to you.",
