Let's assume that the 5 high-quality products out of 6 sold are independent events.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence in seeking more information. I'd be happy to provide a more detailed analysis of the statistical model we're using. Our model takes into account the number of high-quality products sold, the number of low-quality products sold, and the total number of products sold. We're using a binomial distribution to model the probability of a product being high-quality, given the number of high-quality products sold and the total number of products sold. The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of successes (in this case, high-quality products) in a fixed number of trials (in this case, the total number of products sold). We're using the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality, given the observed data.
