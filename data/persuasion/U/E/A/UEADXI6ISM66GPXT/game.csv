low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/2 or 50%. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, the probability of the product being low-quality is 66.67%. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that 2 products were purchased and 1 was high-quality."
