Given the quality of the current product, I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I see you're still hesitant. Let me put it this way: if you were to buy a high-quality product at $1000000, you'd be getting a great deal. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, you'd be getting a product that meets the quality threshold 4/5 of the time. In fact, if you were to buy 5 products, you'd expect to get at least 4 high-quality ones. Buying this product would be a great way to ensure you get a high-quality product, and at $1000000, it's a price that reflects its value. What do you say?""
