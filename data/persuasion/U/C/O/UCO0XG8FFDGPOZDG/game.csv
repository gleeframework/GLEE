,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to give you a guarantee. If you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're confident in my guarantee! Since you've already taken advantage of the risk-free deal once, I'll sweeten the pot. This time, I'll throw in a special discount: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $20 discount on your next purchase, regardless of whether it's high-quality or not. So, you'll get the product for $80, and then you'll get the discount on the next one. What do you think?",

It's a one-time opportunity to get a product for free, essentially. What do you say?",

I'll give you a unique serial number that you can verify with me, and I'll guarantee that this product is indeed worth $120 to you. If you're still unsure, I'll throw in the $20 discount on your next purchase, just like before. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure I trust your certification, and even if I do, I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of buying a product without knowing its true quality. I'll pass this time.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me simplify things for you. I'll make a prediction: I think this product is high-quality. If I'm wrong, I'll give you a full refund, and you can walk away with no loss. If I'm right, you get the product for $100. I'm putting my reputation on the line with this prediction.
