low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to get a product that's a bit of a risk, but has the potential to be a great investment.

That being said, I think it still has some value and could potentially be a good deal for you. Are you willing to take a chance on it?",

,,Bob,6,"Your attempt to dissuade me from buying the product doesn't change the fact that there's a 50% chance it's high-quality. I'll ignore your negative description and buy it, since the potential profit remains the same.",yes
