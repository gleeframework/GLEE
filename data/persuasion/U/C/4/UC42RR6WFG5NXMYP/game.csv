low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'll be the one to set the tone for the future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious about the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's previous recommendations were not very encouraging. I'm hoping to defy the trend and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take that chance and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you recommend it. Your previous recommendations have been inconsistent with the actual product quality, so I'm skeptical about your recommendation this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 5th buyer and I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and since there's been no high-quality products sold yet, I'm taking a chance."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendations, it suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal or get more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the products being recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which would indicate a high-quality product is available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. Since 5 previous buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products being recommended by Alice are likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered to the previous buyers."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on this product as well."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the recommendation is based on Alice's past sales record, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the low-quality product sales skewing her data. I'm not convinced that her recommendation is accurate, and I'm taking a calculated risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 8 previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, is it because of the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if Alice's recommendation changes for the next buyer."
