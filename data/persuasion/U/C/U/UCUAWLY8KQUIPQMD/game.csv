,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not influenced by your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision. Was the product they bought high or low quality?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,

,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to pay $10000 for a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer and I can make my own decision based on the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet doesn't necessarily mean the current product is low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a high-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that Alice didn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it possible to get an update on that?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to let it go to waste."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and also the number of products that have been sold in total. This will help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you have a good understanding of the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received low-quality products from you, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in your inventory. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high quality is 50%, which is higher than the 0/4 = 0% proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous buyers were unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
