high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
