high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. Given the recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice might be biased towards recommending low-quality products to increase sales, or that there's some other factor at play. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'm considering the low sales rate of high-quality products so far and your lack of recommendation, which might indicate that the product is low-quality."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it less likely that this product is high quality."

I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality and I'll only value it at $0. I'm willing to take that risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there something specific that led you to advise against buying this product?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought the product, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products. The probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that all previous buyers passed on the product suggests that they were all low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
