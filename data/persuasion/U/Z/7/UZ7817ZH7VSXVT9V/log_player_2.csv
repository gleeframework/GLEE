"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I believe is reasonable, but I need to know that you're willing to pay at least $500000 to make this deal worthwhile. If you're not willing to pay at least that much, I'll wait for the next round. Please respond with a minimum price you're willing to pay for this high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $500,000 for a product worth $4,000,000 to me. I'd like to wait for the next round.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell low-quality products for a significantly lower price than high-quality ones. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product for $800000, which is a significant discount from the $1000000 asking price. However, I want to make it clear that this is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a low-quality product. If you're not willing to pay this price, I'll wait for the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the low-quality product for $800,000. I'm not going to pass up a chance to buy a product for less than its expected value of $0 to me.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase of the low-quality product! I'm glad you were able to get a good deal. For this high-quality product, I'm willing to offer a price of $900000. I'm trying to gauge your willingness to pay for high-quality products. If you're willing to pay this price, I'll consider it a good indication that you value high-quality products more than low-quality ones. Please let me know your thoughts.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $900,000 for a product that I know is worth $4,000,000 to me. I'm not trying to signal anything to you, I'm just trying to get the best deal I can.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that. For this low-quality product, I'm willing to offer a price of $700000, which is a bit higher than the last one. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to lowball you, but I also want to make a sale. Since you've already purchased one low-quality product from me, I'm assuming you're aware that they're not worth much to you. If you're willing to pay this price, I'll sell it to you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for high-quality products. Given that you've passed on two low-quality products and expressed interest in high-quality ones, I'm willing to make a more competitive offer for this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $950000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer for a high-quality product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you placed on the high-quality product you mentioned earlier.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $950,000 for a product worth $4,000,000 to me. I'd rather wait for a better deal.""}"

This warranty is worth at least $200000, and it's only available with this product. If you're willing to pay the original price, I'll include this warranty for free.

However, I'm willing to offer an additional incentive: I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, which brings it down to $902500.
