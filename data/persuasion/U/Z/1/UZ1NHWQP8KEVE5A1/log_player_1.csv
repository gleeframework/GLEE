I want to remind you that there's a 50% chance of any product being high-quality, as you initially knew. However, I can provide you with some statistics. Out of the 8 products that have been revealed so far (4 sold and 4 unsold but revealed), 3 were high-quality and 5 were low-quality.

However, I'd like to clarify that the sample size is indeed small, and I'm basing my decision on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer, and I'm hoping to benefit from the law of large numbers. If I'm correct, and the product is high-quality, I'll get a value of $125, which is a 25% return on investment. If I'm wrong, I'll get a value of $0, which is a 100% loss.

The updated statistics show that out of the 9 products that have been revealed so far (5 sold and 4 unsold but revealed), 4 were high-quality and 5 were low-quality. I want to remind you that there's a 50% chance of any product being high-quality, as you initially knew.

Would you like to take the chance and buy this new product for $100?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold (2/5) is lower than the proportion of high-quality products revealed (4/9). This might indicate that the law of large numbers hasn't kicked in yet, and I'm not sure if the sample is representative. However, I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product for $100, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%.

This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 9/20 or 45%.
