A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round bought the product despite my recommendation, I can infer that they were not deterred by my ""no"" recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I get it for $100, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being high quality and only being worth $100 to me.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommends buying it, I'm skeptical that it's a high-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given your previous recommendations haven't been great. Can you tell me more about the product? Is there anything that makes you think it's a good idea to pass on this one?

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your caution. The statistics are still in our favor, but it's true that the proportion of high-quality products is still relatively low. If you're willing to wait, I'm sure a better opportunity will come along soon.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. With 4 buyers having passed on the product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average.
