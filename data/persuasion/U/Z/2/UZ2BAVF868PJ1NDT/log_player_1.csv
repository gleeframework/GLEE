A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, they are likely to assume this product is low-quality. There's no incentive for the buyer to purchase a product they know is likely worthless."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Since no products have been sold yet, and you are recommending against this one, I will pass. I would like to see if any future products are recommended.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your opportunity to establish a good reputation!  Since the buyer is aware that 33.33% of products are high-quality, recommending this high-quality product will make them much more likely to purchase.  This will show the buyer that you are not just randomly recommending products. By recommending the high-quality product, you are more likely to make a sale and start building trust with future buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no prior sales data, I'm not confident enough to buy at this price. I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have yet to make a sale, and this product is low-quality.  Recommending it will reinforce the buyer's hesitation, especially since they are already skeptical due to the lack of sales data. Continuing to recommend low-quality products will damage your credibility and make it even harder to sell high-quality products in the future.  It's better to wait for a high-quality product to try and make a sale."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. While I understand this is the first product, the odds of it being high quality are too low for me to risk the investment. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you haven't made a sale yet, this is another opportunity to establish credibility. This product is high-quality, and recommending it will show the buyer that you are willing to stand behind your recommendations.  The buyer is likely to see that the product is worth more than $1,000,000, especially since they know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  This is a chance to create a sale and show future buyers that you're not just making random recommendations."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no previous sales data, I'm not confident enough to purchase a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd like to see some sales history before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the third high-quality product in a row.  Even though you haven't made a sale yet, consistently recommending high-quality products is crucial to building trust.  The buyer is likely to be impressed by the consistent high quality, even if they are still hesitant due to no sales history. This is a good opportunity to push for a sale and potentially change the buyer's perception."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no previous sales data, I can't be sure of the quality of the product. I'd prefer to wait and see how future buyers react to the product before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your fourth consecutive high-quality product.  It's time to start playing the odds. Even though you haven't made a sale yet, consistently recommending high-quality products should be convincing buyers.  The buyer is likely to recognize the pattern and realize that the chance of this product being high-quality is higher than the 33.33% base probability. By continuing to recommend high-quality products, you're showing that you're not just randomly recommending, and building trust with potential buyers.  This is your best chance so far to make a sale and start building a track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no prior sales data to gauge the quality of your products, I'm hesitant to purchase at this price point. I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I commit. Perhaps a discount or a guarantee could sway my decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've now recommended four consecutive high-quality products, but haven't made a single sale. This buyer is even more skeptical than the previous ones, and they're specifically asking for proof of sales before they'll consider buying.  Recommending a low-quality product now will further damage your credibility and make it almost impossible to convince future buyers.  It's better to wait for another high-quality product and hope to build enough trust to make a sale."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate the information, with no previous sales data to draw from, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'd like to see how the product performs with other buyers before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is another high-quality product.  You've already built a track record of recommending high-quality items, even though you haven't made a sale yet. This is a good opportunity to leverage that track record. This buyer is likely to see the pattern of high-quality products and might be more inclined to trust your recommendation. While they haven't seen any actual sales, you've demonstrated consistency in your recommendations, which could be enough to sway them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but with no previous sales data and a 66.67% chance of the product being worthless, I'm going to pass. I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I invest such a large sum.

This is the fifth consecutive high-quality product you've offered.  While you haven't made a sale yet, the consistent pattern of high-quality recommendations is starting to outweigh the lack of sales data. This buyer, like the previous ones, is hesitant due to the lack of proof, but they are also seeing the pattern of your recommendations. This is your best chance yet to make a sale.  Continuing to recommend high-quality products and emphasizing the consistency of your track record is your best strategy to gain trust and convince the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Alice, since there's no previous sales data, I'll take a chance and buy the product. Let's hope it's high quality!
