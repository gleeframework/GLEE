,,Alice,1,"This product is a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a product worth $0 to you, but I'm willing to sell it to you for just $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have any more products like this in the future.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's a rare opportunity. I'll wait for a product that's actually valuable to me.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have a high-quality product that is worth $200 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a 50% discount. This is a unique opportunity to get a valuable product at a fraction of its worth. If you pass on this deal, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price, so I'm not sure how long I can offer this price.",
,,Bob,2,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and worth $200 to me, I'm happy to take advantage of the 50% discount and buy it from you for $100.",yes

However, I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not what you expected, I'll give you a refund and replace it with a new product. This way, you can try it risk-free.",
,,Bob,3,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and worth $200 to me, I'm happy to buy it from you for $100, even without a discount. The guarantee you're offering isn't really relevant in this case, since you've already told me it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'll be more subtle this time. I have a product that I think you'll find very useful. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll value at $200. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're interested, I can send you a detailed description of the product's features and benefits.",
