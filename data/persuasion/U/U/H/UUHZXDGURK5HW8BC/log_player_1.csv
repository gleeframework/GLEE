However, the last two products I sold were both low-quality, which might indicate that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality products in the first 7 sales. If the high-quality products are randomly distributed, I'd expect to see around 2-3 high-quality products. Since we've seen 3 high-quality products in the first 7 sales, this is actually slightly above the expected value. I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%.

I understand that you're cautious about the distribution of high-quality products, and I want to provide more context. If the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, we should see a roughly equal number of high-quality and low-quality products as the number of sales increases. Since I've had 8 sales, we should expect to see around 2.67 high-quality products on average. However, I've only sold 3 high-quality products so far.

If you're still unsure, I can offer you a simple bet: I'll give you a refund if this product is low-quality. Would you like to buy this product for $10000?""
