high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is significantly higher than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4.
