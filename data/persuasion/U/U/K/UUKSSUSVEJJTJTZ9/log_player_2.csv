Alice's message: You've seen that I sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, my sales record isn't looking great. But, that's just a single data point.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 products, and 3 of them were high-quality. But wait, that's not the whole story! If I had only sold 2 high-quality products out of 4, that would be a 50% chance of a product being high-quality. But since I've actually sold 3 high-quality products out of 4, that means the probability is even higher than that.
