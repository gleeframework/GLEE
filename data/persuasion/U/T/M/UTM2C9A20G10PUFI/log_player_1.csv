  ""message"": ""I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 17, and I'm happy to explain why I estimated the probability of this product being high-quality at 45%. The decrease in probability is due to the fact that the previous two products were both low-quality, which is a deviation from the expected 50% rate. However, I want to emphasize that this is a single anomaly, and the overall trend of high-quality products still suggests that my products are generally good.
