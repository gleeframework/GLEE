high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low probability of it being high quality and the fact that Alice's previous recommendation was a buy, which may indicate a low-quality product was recommended."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, but since 2 out of 2 previous buyers have purchased the product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards recommending high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
