"The buyer's message: I've decided not to buy the product. Although your sales record appears to be 100% successful, it's based on only one sale, which isn't enough to establish a reliable pattern. Furthermore, the product's quality is not guaranteed, and there's still a 20% chance it could be of low quality, which would be worth $0 to me.

"The buyer's message: Although you mentioned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, I've noticed that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far.

"The buyer's message: Although your sales pitch is convincing, I'd rather rely on the initial probability of the product being high-quality, which is 80%. Since I don't have any additional information about the current product, I will pass on this offer. The discounted price doesn't change my expected value calculation, which remains $960000 (0.8 x $1200000). The offer of $950000 is still below my expected value, so I'll decline.

We believe this is a unique opportunity that you won't want to pass up.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm and the updated track record. However, I must consider the initial probabilities provided, which state that each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality and a 20% chance of being low-quality. Your track record of 3/5 high-quality products, while seemingly impressive, is still a relatively small sample size and does not significantly alter the initial probabilities for me. Furthermore, the discounted price and the 10% guarantee do increase the appeal, but they do not sufficiently mitigate the risk of receiving a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. Given these considerations, I have decided not to purchase the product.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'll pass on this one. Despite the discounted price and the 15% guarantee, I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality.
