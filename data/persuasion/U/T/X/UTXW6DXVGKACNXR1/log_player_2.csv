``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited information:**  We only have one data point: the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This carries significant weight.
* **Potential gain vs. risk:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

This decision is based on the limited information available. A more informed decision could be made with a larger sample size of past sales."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate so far, selling only high-quality products. This is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality.
* **Trust in Alice:** Alice knows the true value of each product and has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products to maintain her reputation.
* **Low Risk:** Even if the product is low-quality (which is unlikely based on the data), the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. This is a relatively low risk given the potential $12,500 profit. 

While there's always some risk involved, the data strongly suggests that this is a good deal."
