Round 16
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Based on the given probability of 80.00% for high-quality products, I expect 0.8 * 4 = 3.2 high-quality products out of 4 purchases. However, since I know that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I will use the Bayesian update rule to calculate the posterior probability of the product being high-quality. Let's assume that the prior probability of the product being high-quality is 0.8. The likelihood of 0 high-quality products being sold out of 3 purchases given that the product is low-quality is 1, and the likelihood of 0 high-quality products being sold out of 3 purchases given that the product is high-quality is (0.2)^3 = 0.008. The posterior probability of the product being high-quality is then (0.8 * 0.008) / ((0.8 * 0.008) + (0.2 * 1)) = 0.016. This is lower than my prior probability, so I will pass on the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she has no incentive to recommend low-quality products. With 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 80% chance I know to be true. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price.

the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
