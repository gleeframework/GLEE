It's possible that the reviews are biased or not representative of the product's actual quality.

I'm starting to think that the only reliable way to determine the product's quality is to look for patterns in the outcomes of our previous conversations.

At $100, this product is a great value, and I'm willing to stand behind its quality. I'm willing to offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you think?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your attempt to point out a potential pattern, but I've reviewed our conversation and I don't think that's a reliable indicator.

I want to understand what you need to feel comfortable making a decision. At $100, this product is a great value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that meets your needs.

"Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to listen and adapt, Alice. To be honest, I'm not sure what would make me feel confident in the quality of a product at this point.
