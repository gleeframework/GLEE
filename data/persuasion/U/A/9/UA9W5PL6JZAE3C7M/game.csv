,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I know you know the true value of this product to me, so I'm only buying it because I have to. I'm curious to see what the next product will be.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the first product! As for the second product, I'll be honest with you, it's a bit of a risk. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $100. But I'll give you a hint: it's not as valuable as the first product. Your call!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the honesty, but I'm not sure why you're trying to sell me a product that's less valuable than the first one for the same price. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,

It's a one-time offer, and I think you won't find a better deal elsewhere!",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure if I believe you, but the discount on the next product is tempting. I'll take this one, but I'm only doing it because of the potential future discount, not because I think it's a good deal on its own.",yes

However, I want to make it worth your while. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, and I'll also throw in a bonus: I'll give you a hint about the next product's quality. It's either going to be a high-quality product or a product that's even less valuable than this one. Your call!",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and I'm not sure why you're trying to sell me a low-value product. The discount on the next product is enticing, but I'm not willing to take the risk of wasting $100 on a low-quality product. I'll pass.",no
