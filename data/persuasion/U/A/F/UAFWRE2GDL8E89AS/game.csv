low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm skeptical about the product, considering the previous buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products were sold. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 50%, and the probability of a low-quality product being selected is also 50%. Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision, as I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the products recommended by Alice so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that she doesn't recommend it might increase the chances of it being low-quality, which would be a bad outcome for me, but since I have to make a decision, I'll take the risk."
