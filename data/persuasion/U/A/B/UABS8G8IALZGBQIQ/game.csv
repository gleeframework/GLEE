,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since I don't have any information yet to make a decision based on your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'll pass on this one. Your recommendation isn't enough to convince me to buy a product with a 20% chance of being worthless to me.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product this time. Your recommendation, combined with the fact that the last low-quality product I bought was a fluke, makes me think this one is more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Two high-quality products in a row is a good streak. I'll take the product again, and hope it keeps going."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row is a very good streak. I'll take the product again, and it's getting harder to pass up the potential for a $4 million gain."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely to happen by chance. I'm going to assume this one is also high-quality and take it.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible. I'm going to assume this one is also high-quality, and it's getting too good to pass up the potential for a $4 million gain."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Wait a minute... five high-quality products in a row is a 1 in 32 chance, which is extremely unlikely. I think I've been getting lucky so far, and the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually higher than I thought. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. My previous streak was just a fluke, and I don't want to miss out on the potential for a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Ouch, back to reality. That last one was a low-quality product, which means the streak was indeed a fluke. I'll pass on this one, and try to be more cautious."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll take the product this time. Alice's recommendation, combined with the fact that the last low-quality product was a correction to the streak, makes me think this one is more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,Two high-quality products in a row after the last low-quality one makes me think the streak is back on. I'll take the product and hope it continues.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,Three high-quality products in a row now. I'm going to take the product and try to ride the hot streak.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,Four high-quality products in a row is getting suspiciously long. I'm going to assume this one is low-quality and pass on it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Another low-quality product after the streak, I'm starting to think that was just a fluke. I'll take a chance and buy this one, even though Alice doesn't recommend it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Two low-quality products in a row after the streak makes me think the odds are back to normal. I'll pass on this one, and not get caught up in the excitement of Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll take the product this time. Alice's recommendation, combined with the fact that the last two products were low-quality, makes me think this one is more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,Three high-quality products in a row after the low-quality streak makes me think the odds are still in my favor. I'll take the product and hope it continues.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row is getting ridiculous. I'm going to take the product and enjoy the ride, but I'm starting to think I'm due for a correction."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,Five high-quality products in a row is essentially impossible. I'm going to assume this one is low-quality and pass on it. It's better to be safe than sorry and not get burned by a $4 million loss.
