high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many total products have been offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This makes it more likely that the current product is low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems unusual that no high-quality products have been sold despite 2 buyers purchasing.
