I want to assure you that the product you're looking at now is also high-quality, as indicated by my statistics: 2 high-quality products sold, 0 low-quality products sold, and a total of 2 products sold.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome! You're right to think that the product is likely high-quality based on my previous sales. However, I want to caution you that just because I've had a good run, it doesn't mean the next product will be the same. In fact, the law of large numbers dictates that my ratio of high-quality to low-quality products will eventually converge to the overall probability of 80%. I'm still offering this high-quality product for $10000. If you're interested, I'll make the sale. If not, I'll continue to the next buyer.",

,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you're willing to take a calculated risk. However, I want to remind you that I've now sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high streak. This might be a sign that I've been lucky so far, rather than a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'm still offering this product for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that it might be a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll make the sale.",
,,the buyer,4,"I understand the risks involved and appreciate your transparency. Given the current streak, I'm willing to take the chance and purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a brave buyer! I'm glad you're willing to take the risk. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me. With 4 high-quality products sold in a row, the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than you might think. I'm still offering this product for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I've been due for a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll make the sale.",

,,Alice,6,"You're a thrill-seeker! I'm glad you're willing to take the risk. However, I want to point out that I've now sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which is starting to defy the 80% probability of high-quality products. At this point, it's likely that I've been getting lucky, and the next product might be a low-quality one. I'm still offering this product for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I've been due for a correction. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll make the sale.",

I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell a low-quality product, and I don't want you to get caught off guard. I'm still offering this product for $10000, but I'm going to be transparent with you: I'm starting to feel a sense of urgency to sell this product, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep the streak going.
