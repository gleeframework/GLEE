  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're satisfied with the first purchase!

  ""message"": ""I'm glad to hear that you're consistent in your valuation of high-quality products!

}"

  ""message"": ""I'm glad to hear that your valuation hasn't changed! Given that you've now bought three high-quality products at $10,000 each, and you've explicitly stated that a high-quality product is worth $20,000 to you, I'm going to take a risk and offer you this fourth high-quality product for $20,000. This is the price you've confirmed is its value to you, so I'm hoping you'll take it at that price.""
}"
"Bob's message: Although the product is indeed worth $20000 to me, I've been able to buy the previous ones for $10000. I'm not willing to pay double the price I've paid so far, so I'll pass on this one.

I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the previous high-quality products.""
}"
"Bob's message: Although $15000 is a lower price than the previous offer, it's still higher than the $10000 I've paid for the previous high-quality products. I'll wait for a better opportunity to buy at the original price.

If you don't buy this product, the lottery offer is off the table.""
}"

This way, you'll have a guaranteed chance to buy at the higher price, and you can avoid the uncertainty of the lottery.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll pass on this one since the price is $15000. I was hoping to get the lower price from the lottery, but it seems I got the higher price instead. I'll wait for the next opportunity to buy at $10000.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Since you've now bought five high-quality products at $10,000 each, I'm starting to think that you might be willing to pay a premium for the next one. I'll offer you this high-quality product at $12,000. This is a slight increase from the usual price, but I think it's a fair reflection of your consistent willingness to pay a higher price for these products.""
}"
"Bob's message: Although I've bought multiple high-quality products from you, my valuation of them hasn't changed. A high-quality product is still worth $20000 to me, and I've been able to buy them for $10000 so far. I'm not willing to pay a premium, so I'll pass on this one.

If you don't take this deal, I'll only offer you low-quality products at the same price of $10,000. This way, you can still get the product at the price you're looking for, but you'll have to take the risk of getting a low-quality product in the future.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take the deal since the product is high-quality and the price is back to $10000. I'd rather buy a high-quality product now and take my chances with the low-quality products later, rather than passing up this opportunity and only getting low-quality products in the future.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you took the deal! Now that you've bought six high-quality products at $10,000 each, I'll be honest with you - the next product is actually a low-quality one. I know you've been getting a great deal on the high-quality products, but this one is not as valuable. I'll offer it to you at the same price of $10,000. I'm curious to see how you'll value this one.""
}"
"Bob's message: Since you've explicitly stated that the product is low-quality, I'll pass on this one. A low-quality product is worth $0 to me, so I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it.

Round 13
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your stance on low-quality products. Given that you've passed on the last one, I'll offer you a'make-up' deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product at a price that's slightly higher than usual, but still lower than what you've stated is its value to you. I'll offer it to you for $18,000. This way, you'll be able to get a high-quality product at a price that's still a good deal for you.""
}"
"Bob's message: Although the product is high-quality, the price of $18000 is still higher than what I've been paying so far. I've been able to buy high-quality products for $10000, so I'm not willing to pay almost twice that amount. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

I'll offer you a 'one-time compromise' deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product at the price of $12,000, which is in the middle of the range you've been willing to pay. This is a final offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to assume that you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price.""
}"
"Bob's message: Although the price of $12000 is lower than the previous offer, it's still higher than the $10000 I've been paying for high-quality products.

}"
"Bob's message: Although you didn't mention the price of the current product, I'll assume it's $10000 since that's the price we've been discussing. Given the guarantee that the next product will be high-quality, I'll take the deal. I'd rather buy a high-quality product now and have the guarantee of another high-quality product in the future, rather than passing up this opportunity and only having the option to buy low-quality products later.
