I want to offer you this next product, but I'll be upfront with you - the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I've had a bit of a streak of low-quality products recently. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent about the risks.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the transparent communication, Alice. Given the statistics and the risk involved, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
