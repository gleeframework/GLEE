,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm going to trust your recommendation this time, Alice. The odds are already against me with a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, and your recommendation suggests you don't think this one is worth it."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and I have no information to suggest otherwise, I'll pass on this one."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I know the odds are against me, but I assure you that I'm only recommending this product because I genuinely believe it's worth it. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,7,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $120 and the price is $100, the expected value of buying the product is 0.3333 * $120 = $40, which is less than the price of $100. Therefore, I choose not to buy."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I know I haven't made any sales yet, but I assure you that I'm only recommending this product because it's genuinely high-quality. I'm hoping to start building a good reputation with this sale."
,,the buyer,10,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the given probabilities. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality and worth $120, the expected value is $40, which is less than the price of $100. It's not a good deal for me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand that the probabilities are against me, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. I'm starting to think that I'll never make a sale if I don't find a buyer who's willing to take a chance on me. I hope you'll be that buyer."
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the low chance of getting a high-quality product and the significant difference in value between a high-quality ($120) and low-quality ($0) product, I'm inclined not to buy."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I know I haven't made any sales yet, but that also means you have the opportunity to be my first customer and start a positive trend. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to make you a satisfied customer."
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I know the odds are against me, but I'm looking for a buyer who's willing to take a chance on me. If you buy this product and it meets your expectations, I hope we can establish a long-term relationship where you'll get access to more high-quality products in the future."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I've had a string of high-quality products recently, but I haven't been able to find a buyer. I'm starting to think that I'll have to re-evaluate my pricing strategy if I don't make a sale soon. If you buy this product, you'll not only get a great deal, but you'll also be helping me stay in business."
,,the buyer,14,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
