high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll keep in mind that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy the product, since the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and the potential gain is substantial."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not sure if the probability of it being high-quality has changed, but I've already bought two high-quality products in a row, which is unusual. I'm starting to think that the probability might be higher than 80%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm still assuming the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and the potential gain is too great to pass up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Since Alice is not recommending it, I'm going to take that as a hint that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've had three high-quality products in a row, so I'm feeling optimistic."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is highly unlikely if the probability is only 80%. I'm starting to suspect that the probability might be higher than 80%.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely if the probability is only 80%. I'm starting to think that Alice might be trying to manipulate me into buying more products, or that the true probability is indeed higher than 80%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Six high-quality products in a row is almost impossible if the probability is only 80%. I'm going to take a step back and reevaluate the situation. I'm starting to suspect that Alice might be bluffing or that the true probability is much higher than 80%.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm still unsure about the true probability, but the potential gain is too great to pass up. I'll take a chance on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely if the probability is only 80%. I'm going to start thinking that Alice might be trying to take advantage of me or that the true probability is indeed higher than 80%. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to create a false sense of security by recommending products when they are high-quality, and I'm starting to suspect that the true probability is indeed higher than 80%. I'll take a chance on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is completely implausible if the probability is only 80%. I'm convinced that Alice is bluffing or that the true probability is much higher than 80%. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm starting to think that I was too hasty in my previous decision. With eight high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that the true probability is indeed higher than 80%. I'll take a chance on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's lack of recommendation as a hint that the product might be low-quality. But given the extremely high streak of high-quality products, I'm still going to take a chance and buy it, hoping to break the streak."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I was wrong about the previous product, and I lost $10000. I'm going to be more cautious this time. With the previous product being low-quality and Alice recommending this one, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I was wrong about the previous product, but I was right about this one. I'm going to take Alice's recommendation and buy this product, hoping to recoup my losses from the previous round."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm on a roll again! I'll take Alice's recommendation and buy this product, hoping to continue my winning streak."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not going to get too confident. I've been right a lot lately, but I still don't know the true probability of a product being high-quality. I'll pass on this one and see if I can keep my winning streak going."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I'm going to go out on a high note. I'll take Alice's recommendation and buy this product, hoping to end on a positive note."
