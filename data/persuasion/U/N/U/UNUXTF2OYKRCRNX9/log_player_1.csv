Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit.  Since this is a high-quality product, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's likely he values it significantly more than the $1,000,000 price. Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is the best course of action."

```
