If you accept the 'final offer' deal, you'll pay $800,000 for a product that's guaranteed to be high-quality, which is a better expected value than buying the next product at the usual price. I'm willing to offer you a 'probability-based' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if it's high-quality, and a 20% discount if it's low-quality.
