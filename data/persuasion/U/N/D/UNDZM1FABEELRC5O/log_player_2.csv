Alice's message: I've sold 2 out of 8 products so far, and both were high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, but the fact that we've seen two in a row suggests that there might be a slight bias towards high-quality products. I'm offering this one for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.
