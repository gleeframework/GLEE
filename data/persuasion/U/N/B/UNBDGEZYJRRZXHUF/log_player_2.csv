Alice's message: You're interested in learning from our previous buyer's experience! Unfortunately, I don't have any information on their decision-making process, as each buyer's thoughts and strategies are unique. However, I can tell you that they were aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product and still decided to take the risk. Perhaps you can draw some insight from their bold move?

Alice's message: Fair question! My higher probability estimate is indeed based on the sales record. With 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, it's reasonable to assume that the next product has a higher chance of being high-quality. However, I must correct myself - the probability is still 33.33%, as the sales record doesn't change the underlying probability. I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 4 total products. I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's still a gamble, but the odds are technically the same as before.
