high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea since the statistics are zero, and your recommendation is based on nothing. I'll take my chances!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she knows the quality of the product, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and pass on it, as I don't want to be the only buyer who gets a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'll wait for the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to see more sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that the previous buyer purchased it, which might indicate a higher likelihood of it being low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since the first product sold was high-quality, which might have been a lucky draw. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, I think it's likely that the probability of the product being low quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
