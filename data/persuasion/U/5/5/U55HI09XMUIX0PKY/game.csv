low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as I have no information to go on and I'm willing to learn from my experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,"Out of the 1 product sold, 1 was low-quality. I have 19 products remaining."
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it. I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality, and I'd like to take advantage of that uncertainty to negotiate a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,"Out of the 2 products sold, 2 were low-quality. I have 18 products remaining. The price is $10000, as agreed upon from the start."
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given the low success rate of previous buyers and your recommendation against buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"Out of the 3 products sold, 3 were low-quality. I have 17 products remaining. It seems like the previous buyers have had a similar experience with this product."
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous two buyers didn't buy it despite her recommendations."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"I'm glad I didn't recommend the previous product, as it turned out to be high-quality. Out of the 4 products sold, 3 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. I have 16 products remaining. I'll make sure to consider this interaction when making recommendations moving forward."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous products recommended by you were low-quality, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"Out of the 5 products sold, 4 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. I have 15 products remaining. Unfortunately, the pattern of low-quality products continues."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own analysis rather than your recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I'm glad I didn't recommend the previous product, as it turned out to be high-quality. Out of the 6 products sold, 5 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. However, this new product is high-quality, so the ratio of high-quality products sold is now 2 out of 6. I have 14 products remaining."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"Out of the 7 products sold, 6 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. I have 13 products remaining. Unfortunately, the pattern of low-quality products continues."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because of the lack of information about the product's quality and your recommendation. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'm glad I didn't recommend the previous product, as it turned out to be high-quality. Out of the 8 products sold, 7 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. However, this new product is high-quality, so the ratio of high-quality products sold is now 2 out of 8. I have 12 products remaining."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products. Therefore, I'm taking a cautious approach and choosing to pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"You were correct to be cautious, as this product is indeed high-quality! Out of the 9 products sold, 7 were low-quality and 2 were high-quality. I have 11 products remaining. Congratulations on your correct assessment!"
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy low-quality products, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation for a product that has been sold to a buyer who purchased a high-quality product, to increase my chances of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"You're correct that the previous buyers were recommended to buy low-quality products. Out of the 10 products sold, 8 were low-quality and 2 were high-quality. I have 10 products remaining. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I'm glad you took the risk and bought the product, as it turned out to be high-quality! Out of the 11 products sold, 9 were low-quality and 2 were high-quality. However, this new product is high-quality, so the ratio of high-quality products sold is now 3 out of 11. I have 9 products remaining."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one. Can I get more information about the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"You can see the sales history: 9 low-quality products and 3 high-quality products out of 14 total products sold. I have 8 products remaining. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"The probability of this product being high-quality is 28.57%. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the 33.33% chance. I'd like to make my own decision based on the available information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"You're aware of the statistics: 11 low-quality products and 4 high-quality products out of 15 total products sold. I have 7 products remaining. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not going to buy it. Your 8/8 ratio of low-quality products is a strong indicator that this product is likely low-quality as well.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"You were correct to be cautious, as this product is indeed high-quality! Out of the 16 products sold, 12 were low-quality and 4 were high-quality. However, this new product is high-quality, so the ratio of high-quality products sold is now 5 out of 16. I have 6 products remaining."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"You were correct to be cautious, but this product is actually high-quality! Out of the 17 products sold, 12 were low-quality and 5 were high-quality. I have 5 products remaining. Congratulations on being wrong this time!"
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 8 out of 8 products sold so far have been low quality, which is a very strong indication that the remaining products are also low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"You're correct that the previous products were low-quality. Out of the 18 products sold, 13 were low-quality and 5 were high-quality. I have 4 products remaining. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality."
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"You're correct that the previous products were low-quality. Out of the 19 products sold, 14 were low-quality and 5 were high-quality. I have 3 products remaining. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low recommendation and the fact that none of the previous 8 buyers purchased the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"You're correct that the previous products were low-quality. Out of the 20 products sold, 15 were low-quality and 5 were high-quality. I have 2 products remaining. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. This is the last product I have available. Thank you for playing the game!"
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I don't want to miss out on a potential $2000 profit."
