**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know one high-quality product has been sold out of an unknown total. This makes it impossible to accurately assess the probability of the current product being high-quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, while not perfect, does add some value. Since she doesn't know the product's quality, her recommendation likely comes from observing some pattern in previous sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant compared to the cost ($10,000).  Even with the high chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential upside outweighs the risk in this case.

**Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product, hoping it's the second high-quality one.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** While the initial odds of getting a high-quality product are 33.33%, the information provided shows that Alice has already sold 2 high-quality products.  This means there's a higher probability that the remaining products are also high-quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending the product suggests she believes it's high-quality. While not a guarantee, this adds further weight to the decision. 
* **Potential Loss:** The worst-case scenario is getting a low-quality product, but this only means losing $10,000, a price you're willing to risk given the positive indicators.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is high-quality, you stand to gain $10,000 (a positive return on investment).

**In summary, the information available makes buying the product the better decision.**"
