,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyers were more likely to buy high-quality products, but I don't want to assume that the next product will be high-quality based on that. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 buyers have bought the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than the expected 80%.
