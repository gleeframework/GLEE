{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. If she doesn't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, so I'm willing to take the risk.

""Out of the first 6 products sold, 2 were high-quality and 4 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 2/6 or approximately 33.33%. However, I think you should consider that the last 2 products sold were low-quality, which might indicate a temporary dip in high-quality sales. I think this product might be a good opportunity to get a good deal on a low-quality product.""

""Out of the first 8 products sold, 4 were high-quality and 4 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 4/8 or 50%!

I think this product is likely to be high-quality, and I'm willing to vouch for it.""

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
