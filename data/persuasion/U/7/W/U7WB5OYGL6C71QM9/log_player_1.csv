A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism. We've had 17 attempts, with 11 high-quality products sold. Given the significant deviation in the proportion of high-quality products, it's likely that the true probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. However, I must be transparent with you - this one is indeed a low-quality product. Considering the odds, it's likely that we have only one high-quality product left. Would you like to take it home for $1,000,000?""

Would you like to take it home for $1,000,000?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take it home for $1000000, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%, not just because of the odds being in my favor. I'm basing my decision on the observed proportion of high-quality products sold (12/18 = 66.67%) which is significantly higher than the expected value of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for a significant upfront cost, but I'm not convinced by your assertion that the true probability is higher than 33.33%. I'm making an educated guess based on the data.

Would you like to take it home for $1,000,000?""
}"
