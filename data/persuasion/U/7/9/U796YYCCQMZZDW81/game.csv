Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality one. It's a great chance to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 2 total products. I'm selling this one for $10000. Considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's actually more likely that this one is low-quality. I'm offering a 'guarantee' that if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll reveal the quality of the previous 2 products. You can use that information to inform your decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 4 products. I'm selling this one for $10000. Given the fact that 3 out of 4 products were low-quality, it's likely that this one is also low-quality. I'm willing to offer a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you another product for free. If it's high-quality, you'll still only pay $10000.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, but given the statistics and the risk involved, I prefer to pass on this product.",no

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 6 products. I'm selling this one for $10000. Given the fact that 4 out of 6 products were high-quality, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you: the previous 4 high-quality products were all sold with the 'buy-it-now' deal, which may have influenced your perception of the product's quality.
