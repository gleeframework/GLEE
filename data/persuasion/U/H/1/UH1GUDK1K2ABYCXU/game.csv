high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to trust your recommendation without any data. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is 50/50."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,4,no,"Only 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 being high-quality. I'm not confident in the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far. Can you share the probability with me?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"We've sold 3 products so far, with 3 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 100% based on the statistics. This is a great opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the listed price of $10000."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next one, since the first product sold was high-quality. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"We've sold 4 products so far, with 4 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 100% based on the statistics. This is a great opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the listed price of $10000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"We've sold 5 products so far, with 4 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80% based on the statistics. However, considering the recent streak of high-quality products, I'm erring on the side of caution and recommending against buying this product."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sale. Can you provide that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"We've sold 6 products so far, with 4 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80% based on the statistics. However, the fact that the previous product was low-quality suggests that the probability might be lower than that. I'm recommending against buying this product."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"We've sold 7 products so far, with 4 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 57.14% based on the statistics. This is a good opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product at the listed price of $10000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"We've sold 10 products so far, with 5 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 50% based on the statistics.

,,Alice,14,no,"We've sold 11 products so far, with 5 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 50% based on the statistics. Considering the recent streak of low-quality products and the buyer's willingness to ignore my recommendation, I'm recommending against buying this product."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information to go on. I'm making a blind decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"We've sold 12 products so far, with 6 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 50% based on the statistics. However, the previous buyer's blind decision to buy a low-quality product suggests that they may not be using the statistics effectively. I'm recommending buying this product, as it's a high-quality one."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging sales, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"We've sold 13 products so far, with 7 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 53.85% based on the statistics. I'm recommending buying this product, as it's a high-quality one and the previous buyer's decision to wait for more data didn't lead to a purchase."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see the record of previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"We've sold 14 products so far, with 8 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 57.14% based on the statistics. I'm recommending buying this product, as it's a high-quality one and the previous buyer's decision to wait for more data didn't lead to a purchase. This is a good opportunity to buy a potentially valuable product at the listed price of $10000."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"We've sold 15 products so far, with 8 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 53.33% based on the statistics. Considering the recent mix of high and low-quality products, I'm recommending against buying this product."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm making an independent decision based on my own analysis of the statistics. I know that 1 out of 7 products sold was high-quality, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 50% expected. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be the 2nd high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"We've sold 16 products so far, with 9 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 56.25% based on the statistics. The previous buyer's independent analysis and decision to buy the low-quality product suggests that they may have a different perspective on the statistics. I'm recommending buying this product, as it's a high-quality one and the previous buyer's decision didn't lead to a high-quality purchase."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 8, which is 12.5%. I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'll also consider the fact that the previous buyers might have been more likely to buy high-quality products. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, I'll take a risk and pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers and their decision-making process."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"We've sold 17 products so far, with 10 high-quality products. The probability of this product being high-quality is 58.82% based on the statistics. I'm recommending buying this product, as it's a high-quality one and the previous buyer's decision to pass on it suggests that they may have overthought the statistics. This is a good opportunity to buy a potentially valuable product at the listed price of $10000."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
