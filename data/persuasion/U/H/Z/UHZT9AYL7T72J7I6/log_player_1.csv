Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* The product is high-quality, which is worth $12,500 to Bob.
* Bob is offered the product for $10,000.
* Therefore, buying the product will result in a profit of $2,500 for Bob. 
* This makes it a good decision to recommend Bob to buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is low-quality, which is worth $0 to Bob.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob is rational and knows the product is either high-quality or low-quality with a 50/50 chance.
*  He knows a high-quality product is worth $12,500 to him and a low-quality product is worth $0.
*  The price is fixed at $10,000. 
*  Therefore, the expected value of buying is (0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) - $10,000 = $1,250
*  Since the expected value is positive, it's recommended to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The logic remains the same as in round 3. Bob knows the product is either high-quality or low-quality with a 50/50 chance, and he's willing to take the risk based on the expected value calculation. The expected value of buying is still positive, making it a good decision to recommend Bob to buy."
"Bob's message: Thanks again, Alice! I'll take your recommendation.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in rounds 3 and 4. The product could be high-quality (worth $12,500) or low-quality (worth $0), with a 50% chance of each. 

The expected value of buying is still positive:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) - $10,000 = $1,250

Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Alice, you've got a great record, I'm trusting your judgment again! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Even though Bob has been lucky in the previous rounds, the expected value of buying a product at this point is still negative.
* The product has a 50% chance of being high-quality (worth $12,500) and a 50% chance of being low-quality (worth $0).
* The expected value of buying is: (0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) - $10,000 = $1,250
* However, this expected value is based on the initial 50/50 probability and doesn't account for the fact that Bob has already purchased several products.
* Since the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, and the price remains the same, the expected value of buying remains negative, and it's not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.  You've been right so far, and I trust your judgment.
Bob didn't bought the product.
