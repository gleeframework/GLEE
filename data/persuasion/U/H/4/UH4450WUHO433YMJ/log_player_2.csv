**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. 
* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point from a previous buyer, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough to draw strong conclusions about the overall quality of products Alice is offering.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  Since we don't have any information suggesting Alice is dishonest or that the product quality is skewed towards low-quality, it's reasonable to take the risk.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If we pass, the product is discarded, and we miss the opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product."
