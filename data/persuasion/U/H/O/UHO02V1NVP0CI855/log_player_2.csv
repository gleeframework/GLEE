Keep in mind that the previous product was not sold, which might indicate that it was low-quality. However, this doesn't necessarily mean anything, as buyers can be cautious or have different preferences. I'll give you a simple statement: 'I'm still optimistic about the quality of my products.'

I'll answer your question from the previous buyer: if I were selling a low-quality product, I would be optimistic about its quality 60% of the time, because I'm a seller trying to make sales. Now, I'd like to offer you a different deal: I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $9000, the same price as the second product. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'm glad you asked about the discount! I offered the discount because I want to balance the risk of selling a low-quality product. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total, I think the probability that this product is high-quality is higher than 80%. However, I don't want to reveal the exact probability, as that might give away too much information. I'll simply say that I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I understand your concerns! Let me provide more context. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, I think it's likely that I've 'found my groove'. I'd like to offer you a 'hot streak' discount: I'll sell this product to you for $9000, the same price as the second and fourth products. Think of it as a 'buy low' opportunity. What do you think?

I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total, which is a 80% success rate, matching the expected probability. However, I'd like to point out that the last 3 products were all high-quality, which is higher than the expected probability.

I've sold 11 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products, which is still within the expected 80/20 ratio. However, the last 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a temporary dip.
