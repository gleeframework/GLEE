,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there something specific that made you think this product is not worth buying? I'd like to make an informed decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the quality of the product, but rather her own strategy."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%, so I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take a chance. I'll buy the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's reasonable to assume that the products that were passed on were low-quality. Therefore, I'm inclined to pass on the product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the current statistics."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the fact that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
