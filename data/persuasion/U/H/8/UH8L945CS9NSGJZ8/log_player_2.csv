**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since the first buyer bought the product and it was high quality, the success rate is 100%. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product provides additional confidence. While her recommendation isn't guaranteed, it's a positive signal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $400 is significant, while the potential loss is only $100. 
* **Limited Data:**  With only one previous sale, the data is still very limited. It's impossible to know if Alice's recommendations are consistently accurate.

**In this case, the potential upside outweighs the risk, making it worthwhile to buy the product.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products so far (2/2). This suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $400 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $100. 

**It's important to note:** This is a calculated risk based on the limited information provided. While the current data points towards a high-quality product, there is still a 50% chance it could be low quality."
