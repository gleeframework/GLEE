,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to get information about the product's quality. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000000, but if I buy and it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the price. I'm essentially using my purchase as a way to get a free sample of the product's quality, even though I know it's not the best strategy in terms of expected value."
