high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, since the probability of it being high quality is 80% and I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'd like to see the quality of the product for myself."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended 2 low-quality products to the previous buyers. I think the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the average, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality, and I'd like to see if I can get a high-quality product for the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on her own information. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00% and I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products, which would suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, so I'll pass on it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your previous recommendations, and I'd like to pass on it. Please consider selling it to the next buyer."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and yet none of the products sold have been high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on your previous sales record, and you've recommended it to me. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
