I'm willing to take the risk and let you decide whether it's worth the investment. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

Since you're the third buyer, I want to give you a little more information. I've sold a total of 2 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's 50% of my sales so far. I'm willing to share this information with you because I believe it's a sign of good things to come. Will you take a chance on this product and join the growing list of satisfied customers?",

In fact, I'm willing to be transparent about my process. I source my products from a variety of suppliers, and I have a team that inspects each product before it's offered to you. Unfortunately, sometimes mistakes can happen, and that's what happened with the previous products. However, I'm confident that this one is different. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to provide you with the same deal as before: if you buy the product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a refund for the difference between the price you paid and the actual value of the product.

I understand that the statistics are against you, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to being transparent about my process. Unfortunately, I can't provide you with more information about the supplier or the inspection process, as that would compromise my relationships with my suppliers.
