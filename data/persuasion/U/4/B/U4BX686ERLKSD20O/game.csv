,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our exclusive offer! As you may know, our products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.

,,Alice,9,"I'm happy to share our sales record with you! As of now, we've had a total of 8 buyers, and 3 of them have purchased high-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your request for more information! As of now, we've had a total of 8 buyers, and 5 of them have purchased low-quality products. That's a 62.5% failure rate.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 37.5% (3/8). However, since we've had a streak of low-quality products, I'd estimate the probability of the current product being high-quality to be slightly lower, around 25-30%. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and the actual quality of the product is still unknown. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?",
