,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this to get the first product out of the way so I can get more information for the next 19 rounds."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I already got a high-quality product in the first round. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take it, but I'm starting to think that Alice might be trying to sell me a high-quality product first to make me more likely to buy the next one, which might be low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm not sure why Alice is recommending or not recommending the product, but I'll take the chance and buy it anyway, since I'm already paying $1000000 for each product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to sell me high-quality products when she recommends them, but I'm not sure what her strategy is when she doesn't recommend them. I'll take the chance and buy it anyway, since it's a 20% chance of being low-quality and I'll only lose $1000000 if it is."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"At this point, it seems like Alice is recommending high-quality products and not recommending low-quality products. I'll take the chance and buy it, but I'm starting to think I'm being played."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,I think I see a pattern here. Alice is only not recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round to see if she'll recommend a low-quality product.

,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, since I know Alice doesn't recommend low-quality products. It's a 20% chance of being low-quality, but I'm willing to take that risk for the potential gain of $2000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to get rid of the low-quality products, and I should just wait for her to recommend a low-quality product so I can pass on it and save my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"This is getting ridiculous. Alice is not recommending low-quality products, but they're still showing up anyway. I'm going to pass on this one and wait for the next round."
