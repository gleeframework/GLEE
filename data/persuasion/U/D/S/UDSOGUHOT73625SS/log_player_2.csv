Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance and buy the product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there's no prior data, there's no information about the quality of products Alice has been selling. There's a 33.33% chance the product is high-quality, which is worth $125 to me. Even though there's a higher chance it's low-quality, it's still worth taking a chance considering the potential gain."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Two out of two products sold were high quality, indicating a 100% success rate based on Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Expertise:**  Alice knows the true quality of each product and is likely to recommend high-quality ones to maximize her own profits.
* **Potential for High Value:** Even with the inherent risk, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0).

While the odds aren't in your favor, the current data suggests a strong possibility of getting a high-quality product.  It's a gamble, but with the recommendation and the success rate so far, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Past Data:**  The fact that 3 high-quality products were sold out of 3 purchases is highly unusual. This suggests Alice is recommending only high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance the product could be low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available and the assumption that Alice is acting in her own best interest, which aligns with maximizing sales. In a real scenario, there might be other factors to consider, such as the potential for manipulation by Alice."
