Alice's message: I'm happy to provide the updated probability! After 9 sales, with 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 6/9. However, since the 3 low-quality products were sold consecutively, we need to consider the conditional probability of a product being high-quality given that the previous product was low-quality. Let's call this conditional probability p. We can calculate p as follows: p = (number of high-quality products after the streak) / (total products after the streak) = 3/6 = 1/2. So, the probability of a product being high-quality given that the previous product was low-quality is 1/2. I'm offering this next product to you for the same price of $100.
