Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the first product was low-quality and the buyer didn't buy it, there's no reason to believe the second product is any better.  Without any positive information about the quality of your products, recommending a purchase would be irresponsible."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no historical data yet, and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now. Let's see how things play out with other buyers.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the current product is high-quality, the buyer has no information to suggest this. The previous two products were low-quality, and the buyer is likely hesitant to take a risk without more evidence. It's better to continue building trust by demonstrating quality through future sales before recommending this product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no data on previous sales, and your recommendation is to pass, I will not buy the product. I would like to see more information about the product before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is showing a pattern of being cautious and needing evidence before purchasing.  We've had three rounds with no sales, and two of those were low-quality products. Recommending this product, especially since it's also low-quality, would only further reinforce the buyer's perception of low quality and likely lead to another refusal."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one. Since there's no track record yet, I'd prefer to wait and see how things play out with other buyers.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the current product being high-quality, the buyer is showing a strong pattern of skepticism. They need concrete evidence of consistent quality before risking a purchase.  Recommending this product, even if it's good, would likely be met with another refusal and further damage the buyer's trust in you."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass for now, as there's no data yet on the product quality. I'll wait and see how others fare before deciding.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has consistently demonstrated a need for evidence of product quality. They haven't bought any of the products yet, and even though this one is high-quality, recommending it would likely lead to another refusal.  Continuing to refuse and potentially showcasing a few more high-quality products in a row will build trust and make the buyer more likely to purchase in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet on the quality of products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see how the quality of the products sold to other buyers turns out before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is extremely cautious and needs a lot of proof before considering a purchase. We've had six rounds with no sales, despite offering a few high-quality products.  Recommending this product, even though it's high-quality, will likely lead to another refusal. We need to build more trust by consistently offering high-quality products and hopefully, showing the buyer that others are purchasing them before we can expect them to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since this is the first product and there's no information on previous sales, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to see how the product quality pans out for others before making a decision.

We have now gone through eight rounds with no sales, despite offering several high-quality products. Recommending this product, even though it's high-quality, will likely result in another refusal and further damage the buyer's trust. We need to continue offering high-quality products and hope that seeing others purchase them will finally convince this buyer to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no sales history yet and you are not recommending the product, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Recommending this high-quality product will likely result in another refusal, further damaging the buyer's trust. To earn their confidence, we need to continue offering high-quality products and hope that witnessing others purchase them will eventually convince them to take a chance."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have had nine rounds with no sales, and this product is low-quality. Recommending it would only further confirm the buyer's perception of low-quality products. We need to focus on selling high-quality products to establish a positive reputation before even considering recommending a low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, and the risk of getting a low-quality product is significant, I'll pass on this one. I'll observe the sales records and see how the quality of the products plays out before making a purchase.

A new potential buyer has arrived!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite having a high-quality product, recommending it to this buyer is unlikely to result in a sale. We've gone through 10 rounds without a single sale, and this buyer is very cautious. Recommending a product at this point, even a high-quality one, will likely reinforce their skepticism. We need to continue offering high-quality products and hope that witnessing others purchase them will finally convince this buyer to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no data on past sales, I am going to pass on this product. I'll wait to see if the quality of future products is better.
