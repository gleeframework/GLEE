Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Here's why:

* **Bob is rational:**  He knows the odds (1/3 chance of a good product) and the potential payoff.
* **The price is too high:** Even if he knew the product was high-quality, it's still a bad deal for him ($1,000,000 price vs. $3,000,000 value). 
* **No information advantage:**  Alice has no way to signal the product's quality to Bob.

Since Bob has no reason to believe this product is any different from the previous ones, he's likely to continue passing."
