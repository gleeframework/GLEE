"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of the product for Bob is:

* 0.8 * $30,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $24,000

This is significantly higher than the selling price of $10,000. Therefore, it is highly recommended for Bob to buy the product."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round doesn't change the underlying probabilities.  Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and this round's product is indeed high-quality.  The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $30,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $24,000

This is still significantly higher than the selling price of $10,000, so it's highly recommended for Bob to buy the product again."
