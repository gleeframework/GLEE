"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for you. If you buy it, you'll get a great product that will meet your expectations. However, if you decline, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just take the chance.""
}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the first product! Now that you've made a purchase, I'll give you a bit more information. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far. I'm offering you another high-quality product for $1000000. This product is a great opportunity to get another high-quality item, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price to you. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that is just as good as the one you already bought. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if it's worth the price, I've only seen one high-quality product so far, and I don't know the probability of the next one being high-quality.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the probability of the next product being high-quality. Let me offer you a deal. I'll give you a 50% discount on the price of the next product if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price of $1000000. This way, you'll have a better idea of the potential value of the product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the discount, it's a good compromise, and I'll get a better deal if it's high-quality.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took advantage of the deal! Now that you've bought two high-quality products, I'll give you an update on the sales so far. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products. Since you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a slight increase in the discount for the next product. If it's high-quality, I'll give you a 60% discount on the price. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the increased discount, it's still a good deal, and I'll get an even better price if it's high-quality.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're on a roll! With 3 high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think you're a high-quality connoisseur. I'll increase the discount even further. If the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a 70% discount. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price. But here's the twist: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll also reveal the probability of the next product being high-quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",

}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're really getting a good deal now! With 4 high-quality products in a row, I think I can safely say that you're on a hot streak. I'll give you an 80% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. But here's the thing: since you've seen 4 high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is at least 60%. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

But I'm glad you bought this product, because now you know that the probability is indeed 50%. As for the product you just bought, I'm willing to give you a refund of $500000 since it's low-quality. You'll still get to keep the product, but you'll only pay $500000 for it. What do you think about buying the next product?
