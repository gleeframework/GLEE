,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I have no prior information to go on and I'm essentially flipping a coin to decide, but I'd rather take the chance and see what I get."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to understand the dynamics of the game and the value of the information you provide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm doing this to test her strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products might be mostly low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000 on a product that's not worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than the stated 33.33%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of the first 4 products were low-quality, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll take a chance and pass on this product to see if I can get a higher-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which could be a result of the low-quality products being sold to the previous buyers."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's unlikely that all 7 products would be low-quality. I'll pass on this product to see if I can get a better sense of the situation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be due to a selection bias, and I don't want to be the first to buy a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm doing this because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the fact that you don't recommend it might be a good sign that it's low quality. However, I'm also aware that you don't know my valuation, so I'm taking a chance."
