low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it, which makes me think it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a better deal than the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000 for it since I've seen that all previous buyers have been discouraged by your recommendations and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the previous sales, such as the total number of high-quality products offered and the total number of products offered?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended not to buy, and that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also been recommended not to buy, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations.

I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy it."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know if it's high quality or low quality."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to pass on the product. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold suggests that the previous buyers may have been overconfident in the product's quality, which is a red flag. I'd rather play it safe and pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice seems suspiciously optimistic given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a purchase."
