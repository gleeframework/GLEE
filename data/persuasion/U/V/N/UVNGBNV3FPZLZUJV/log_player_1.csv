Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

As a seller, my goal is to maximize my profits. Since the product in this round is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of high-quality products is 80%, it's likely that he values high-quality products significantly. There's a high chance Bob will perceive the $1,000,000 price as a good deal, especially considering the high probability of the product being high-quality.  Therefore, I would recommend Bob to buy the product."

```

**Explanation:**

Bob bought the product in the previous round, which means he likely perceived the value of the product (even if it was a gamble) to be worth the price.
