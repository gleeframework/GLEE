,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet. I'd like to wait for a more informed decision."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, and Alice's recommendation is not enough to convince me to take the risk. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm aware that you recommended it, but since there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that Alice knows the value of the product to me, and her recommendation is likely based on that knowledge. Given the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is less than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
