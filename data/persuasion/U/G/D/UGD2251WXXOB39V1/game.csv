,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Can I get an update on this?"

,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm not interested in a low-quality product. Can you confirm its quality before I make the purchase?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
