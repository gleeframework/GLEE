"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because I'm trying to understand your pricing strategy and the probability of a high-quality product.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate the data and the discount offer, but I'm still a bit skeptical about the high-quality probability. Given the 82.14% probability, I'd like to calculate the expected value of buying the product. If I buy it and it's high-quality, I get $125 - $90 = $35 profit. If it's low-quality, I get $0 profit. The probability of it being high-quality is 0.8214, so the expected value is (0.8214 * $35) + (0.1786 * $0) = $28.69. Considering this, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $90.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about selling at a loss, but I'd like to think about the implications of your secret.
