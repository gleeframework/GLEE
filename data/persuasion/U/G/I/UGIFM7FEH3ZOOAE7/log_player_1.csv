Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of Profit:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, which would net them a $4,000,000 profit.
* **No Risk of Loss:** Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the buyer only loses $1,000,000, which is less than the potential profit.
* **First Round:** With no prior information about your selling record, the buyer should act based on the known probability of the product's quality. 

Therefore, it's highly recommended for the buyer to purchase the product in this first round."
