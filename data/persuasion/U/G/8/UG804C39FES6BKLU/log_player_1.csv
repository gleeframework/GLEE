"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality. While I don't know the exact value to Bob, there's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, and I'm guaranteeing it is. The price is fixed, and Bob has no way of knowing the quality beforehand. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a high-quality product at a fixed price outweighs the risk for Bob."
