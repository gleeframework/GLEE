**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. The only data point is that one buyer purchased a high-quality product based on Alice's recommendation.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, even low-quality ones. However, her recommendation suggests she believes this product is high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($125) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0). 
* **Assumption:** We assume Alice is trying to maintain a good reputation. If she consistently recommends low-quality products, buyers will stop trusting her.

**Therefore, despite the limited information, it is a reasonable gamble to buy the product.**"
