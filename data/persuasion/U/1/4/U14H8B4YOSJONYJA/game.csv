,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on Alice's lack of information about my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 high-quality product was sold, which suggests a high-quality product is more likely to be sold. If I buy, I'll only get $30000, but if I pass, the next buyer will have a 33.33% chance of getting the high-quality product and I'll only lose the $10000 price. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, but I'm inclined to let the next buyer have the chance to get it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
