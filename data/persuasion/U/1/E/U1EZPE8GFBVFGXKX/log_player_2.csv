**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This information is very valuable, as Alice knows the true quality of the product.
* **The statistics:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of one buyer is a very strong indicator that the probability of this product also being high-quality is high.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $200 value product significantly outweighs the risk of getting a $0 value product. 

**Therefore, it's a good strategy to buy the product based on the information available.**"

``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the information about the previous sales is very encouraging. Three buyers have already purchased high-quality products, suggesting a possible bias in Alice's recommendations towards good products. Since the potential reward is high ($200), it's worth taking the risk."
