"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500) outweighs the potential loss. It's always a gamble, but the odds are in our favor in the long run."
