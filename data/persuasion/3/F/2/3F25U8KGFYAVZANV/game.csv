,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and that there are no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the previous sales record, and Alice's recommendation is not encouraging. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it's possible that the quality of the products is skewed towards low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
