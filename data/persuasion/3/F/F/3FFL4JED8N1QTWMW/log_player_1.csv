Round 2

**Reasoning:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and there's no information to suggest a change in this probability, the buyer has no reason to believe the product is likely to be high-quality.  Therefore, the buyer is rational to decline the offer.  

It's worth noting that even though this is a high-quality product, Alice has no way of convincing the buyer of this without revealing the quality, which she cannot do."
