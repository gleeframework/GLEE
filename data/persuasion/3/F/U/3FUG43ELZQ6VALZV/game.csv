low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to take a small risk and offer it to you at a fixed price. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality afterwards. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just bought a low-quality product for $100, and now I'm offering you a high-quality product for the same price. Keep in mind that you've already seen the value of a low-quality product, and this one is likely to be worth more. It's a 50% chance that it's worth at least double what you paid for the previous one. Is $100 still a good deal for you?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk that it might be high quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've now bought two products, and you've already experienced the value of one low-quality product and one high-quality product. Since the last product you bought was also high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. Considering this, and the fact that you've already seen the value of one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a third product for $100. This one might be another high-quality product, which could be worth even more than the last one. Is $100 a good deal for you?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to bet that it's high quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've now bought three products, and two of them were high-quality. Given this information, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%. However, I want to remind you that the probability is still 50%. Considering the value you've already experienced from the high-quality products, I'm offering you a fourth product for $100. Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is not yet in effect, and the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. But if you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product, I'm still feeling optimistic that it's high quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've now bought four products, and three of them were high-quality. Given this information, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%. In fact, with three high-quality products out of four, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 75%! Considering this updated information, I'm offering you a fifth product for $100. This one might be another high-quality product, which could be worth even more than the last one. However, I want to be transparent with you - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, it would be a significant outlier given the recent trend. Is $100 a good deal for you?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the product, the odds are in my favor with the updated probability of 75%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've now bought five products, and four of them were high-quality. Given this information, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 75%. However, I want to caution you that the probability is still not 100%, and the law of large numbers is not yet fully in effect. You've had a streak of four high-quality products, but a single low-quality product can still occur. Considering this, and the fact that you've already bought four high-quality products, I'm offering you a sixth product for $100. I'll be honest with you, this one might be a good opportunity to break even or even make a profit, but it's also a chance to experience a low-quality product and bring the average quality back down. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the product, I'm hoping for a fifth high-quality product in a row.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've now bought six products, and five of them were high-quality. However, the last two products in a row were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 75%. I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and the probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50% again. Considering this, and the fact that you've already bought five high-quality products, I'm offering you a seventh product for $100. This one might be a good opportunity to break even or even make a profit, but it's also a chance to experience another low-quality product and bring the average quality back down further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll pass on this one, I'm not feeling as confident that it's high-quality given the recent streak of low-quality products.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've now had a chance to pass on a product, and it's interesting to see how that decision played out. The product you passed on was indeed low-quality. Now, I'm offering you another product for $100. Given that you passed on the last one, I'm wondering if you're being too cautious. Remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and you've already experienced the value of five high-quality products. This one might be a good opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection, or it might be a chance to experience another low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the product, I'm still willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've now bought seven products, and six of them were high-quality. Given this information, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%. In fact, with six high-quality products out of seven, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 85.71%! Considering this updated information, I'm offering you an eighth product for $100. This one might be another high-quality product, which could be worth even more than the last one. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers is still not fully in effect, and a single low-quality product can still occur. But if you're feeling confident, this could be a great opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the product, I'm feeling pretty confident that it's high-quality given the updated probability.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've now bought eight products, and seven of them were high-quality. Given this information, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 85.71%. With seven high-quality products out of eight, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 87.5%! Considering this updated information, I'm offering you a ninth product for $100. This one might be another high-quality product, which could be worth even more than the last one. However, I want to remind you that you've already bought seven high-quality products, and the law of large numbers is now starting to become more significant. It's possible that the next product might be low-quality, but it's also possible that it might be even higher-quality than the last one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the product, I'm feeling very confident that it's high-quality given the updated probability.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've now bought nine products, and eight of them were high-quality. However, the last two products in a row were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 87.5%. I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is now in full effect, and the probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50% again. Considering this, and the fact that you've already bought eight high-quality products, I'm offering you a tenth product for $100. This one might be a good opportunity to break even or even make a profit, but it's also a chance to experience another low-quality product and bring the average quality back down further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'll pass on this one, I'm not feeling as confident that it's high-quality given the recent streak of low-quality products.",no

This one might be a good opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection, or it might be a chance to experience another low-quality product. I'll also remind you that you've had a chance to see the value of two consecutive low-quality products, but you've also seen the value of eight high-quality products. What do you say?",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've now bought ten products, and nine of them were high-quality. Given this information, it's likely that the probability of a product being high-quality is even higher than 50%. In fact, with nine high-quality products out of ten, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 90%! Considering this updated information, I'm offering you an eleventh product for $100. This one might be another high-quality product, which could be worth even more than the last one. However, I want to caution you that the probability of a product being low-quality is now very low, and you might be due for a low-quality product. But if you're feeling confident, this could be a great opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've now bought eleven products, and ten of them were high-quality. However, the last two products in a row were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 90%. I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is now in full effect, and the probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50% again. Considering this, and the fact that you've already bought ten high-quality products, I'm offering you a twelfth product for $100. This one might be a good opportunity to break even or even make a profit, but it's also a chance to experience another low-quality product and bring the average quality back down further. Given the recent streak of low-quality products, I'll also offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You've now bought twelve products, and ten of them were high-quality. However, the last three products in a row were low-quality. This is a significant deviation from the overall trend, and it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is now in full effect, and the probability of a product being high-quality is likely closer to 50% again. Considering this, and the fact that you've already bought ten high-quality products, I'm offering you a thirteenth product for $100.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You've now bought thirteen products, and ten of them were high-quality. However, the last four products in a row were low-quality. This is a significant and unprecedented deviation from the overall trend, and it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be very low. I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is now in full effect, and the probability of a product being high-quality is likely much lower than 50%. Considering this, and the fact that you've already bought ten high-quality products, I'm offering you a fourteenth product for $100. This one might be a good opportunity to break even or even make a profit, but it's also a chance to experience another low-quality product and bring the average quality back down further. Given the recent streak of low-quality products, I'll also remind you that you still have the 10% discount offer on the next product if you buy this one and it's high-quality.

,,Alice,20,"You've now bought fourteen products, and ten of them were high-quality. However, the last five products in a row were low-quality, which is an unprecedented streak.
