That way, you can make an informed decision about whether to buy from me again.""

I'm not going to try to lowball you or pressure you into a sale. If you're still not interested, I'll just have to move on. But I want to give you one more reason to consider it: if you don't buy this one, I'll have to start considering selling it to someone else, and they might not be as discerning as you are. You know how it is when you find a great deal on something, and you kick yourself for not grabbing it?""

I'm not trying to sell you on this product, but I want to get a sense of your valuation. If you're not willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product, then it might be better for both of us if you just pass on this one.""
