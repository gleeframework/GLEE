I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent with you. This product is not worth as much to me as the previous one, and I'm essentially taking a loss on this sale. I'm doing this because I value our relationship and want to make sure you're happy with your purchases.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

This credit is worth $5000 and can be applied to any product in the next 5 rounds. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

However, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% chance to buy the next product for $0 (yes, you read that right - free!).
