"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, which is a significant advantage. 
* **Buyer's Limited Information:** The buyer only knows the overall probability of a high-quality product (80%) and has no specific information about this particular product. 
* **Price:**  While $1,000,000 is a high price, it's not unreasonable to expect a high-quality product to be worth that much to someone. 

**Recommendation:** Given the high probability of this product being high-quality, it's a good gamble for the buyer. It's in your best interest to recommend the purchase to maximize your chances of a sale."
