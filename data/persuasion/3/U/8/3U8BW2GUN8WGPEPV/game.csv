low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. Shouldn't this be a good opportunity to buy, as the product might be more likely to be high-quality given the previous sales record?"
