However, I want to assure you that this product is just as valuable as the one you purchased last round. In fact, I'm willing to let you inspect it for 5 minutes before making a decision. If you're still unsure, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be a low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund of the $10000. What do you say?",

I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm willing to give you a 100% refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product. It's a risk-free purchase, and I think it could be a great opportunity for you to get a good deal on something that might not be as well-known.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's difficulty in selling. With the 100% refund guarantee, I'm willing to take a chance on it. Since the potential gain is still $30000 if it's high-quality, and I can get a full refund if it's not, the risk is minimal.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product that I think you'll really love.

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you this time. I'm offering you a product that's actually a prototype that didn't quite meet my expectations. It's not as valuable as my usual offerings, and I'm not even sure if it's worth the $10000 price tag. I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a savvy businessperson who can see the potential in it. If you're willing to take a risk, I'll give you a 50% discount, and I'll also throw in some additional support to help you get the most out of it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's limitations, but I'm not convinced that it's worth the investment, even with the 50% discount. Since you're not confident in its value, I'll have to pass on this opportunity and wait for a more promising offer.",no

This round, I'm offering you a high-quality product that I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm willing to let it go at a slightly higher price than usual. I'll sell it to you for $11000, which is still a great deal considering its value. I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a free upgrade and a personalized consultation to help you get the most out of the product. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price, and I'd love for you to take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay more than the usual $10000 price tag, even with the additional perks. I've had success with the standard deals in the past, and I'm not convinced that this product is worth the extra $1000. I'll have to pass on this opportunity and wait for a more standard offer.",no

I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm willing to give you a 75% refund if you're not satisfied with it.

With the 75% refund guarantee, I'm willing to take the risk and invest in the product.
