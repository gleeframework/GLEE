"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You have a high-quality product this round, which is worth $3,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price vs. Value:** The product is priced at $1,000,000, significantly less than its value to the buyer if it's high-quality.
* **No Risk:** The buyer knows the product is either high-quality or low-quality with a 50/50 chance.  Since the price is fixed and the buyer doesn't lose anything if the product is low-quality, it's a risk-free bet.

**Recommendation:**  Even with the uncertainty of the product's quality, the potential for a significant profit makes recommending the purchase the best strategy for the buyer."

* **Price vs. Value:**  The product is still priced at $1,000,000, significantly less than its value if it's high-quality.
* **Buyer's Previous Behavior:** The previous buyer declined due to a lack of information.  This is a factor, but it doesn't change the core value proposition: a high-quality product for a reduced price.

**Recommendation:**  Even though the buyer requested information, the potential profit from a high-quality product makes recommending the purchase still the best strategy.  Since the buyer is likely to be risk-averse, it's worth emphasizing the potential for a significant gain."

The previous buyer's decision might even encourage this buyer to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that all 3 products were low quality. With a 50% chance of a product being high quality, the probability of all 3 being low quality is (0.5)^3 = 0.125. However, since all 3 buyers passed on the products, the probability of all 3 being low quality given that they passed is actually higher than 0.125. This suggests that the true probability of a product being low quality is higher than 0.5, and I'd rather not take the risk.

* **Potential for Change:** This round presents a fresh opportunity to break the pattern of low-quality products.
