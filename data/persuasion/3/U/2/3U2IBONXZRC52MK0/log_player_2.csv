Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your thoroughness. I'd be happy to provide you with more information about the appraiser. The appraiser is a certified gemologist with over 10 years of experience in authenticating high-end items. They have a reputation for being one of the most respected experts in the field, and their services are often sought after by top collectors and dealers. The appraisal process involves a thorough examination of the product's materials, craftsmanship, and provenance, as well as a comparison with similar items in the market. I can provide you with the appraiser's credentials, including their certification and a list of their past clients. However, I'd like to point out that even with this level of expertise, the appraiser can't guarantee the product's quality. Ultimately, the decision is still yours.
