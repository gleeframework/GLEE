high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, since you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that since you've recommended against it, it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to waste my money."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, considering the previous 5 buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it. I'm going to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on the current product and hope that the next one will be high-quality."

,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,19,no,
