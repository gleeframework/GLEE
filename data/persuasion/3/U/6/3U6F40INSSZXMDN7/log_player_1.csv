{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still have no data on the quality of products sold, as both previous buyers declined. Recommending a low-quality product at this point would be risky, as there's a high chance the buyer will be dissatisfied and may not buy from you in the future. It's best to continue to avoid recommending products until you have some positive data to present."

**Explanation:**

We still have no successful sales history, and recommending another low-quality product would further solidify the lack of trust.

Otherwise, we risk alienating potential buyers and harming our future sales prospects."

**Explanation:**

Despite the 18th consecutive unsuccessful round and a low-quality product, we must remain consistent with our strategy.

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in a very difficult situation. We've now had 19 consecutive unsuccessful rounds.  Recommending a low-quality product at this point would be a disaster. It would further damage the buyer's perception of our offerings and likely result in yet another failed sale.  

The best course of action is to continue to avoid recommending products until we have at least one successful sale.  We need to find a way to build trust with buyers. This might involve offering a discount or running a promotion to incentivize a purchase, or perhaps finding a different way to demonstrate the value of our products.

We need to find a way to break this cycle of unsuccessful sales.  Otherwise, we'll likely never make a sale in this scenario."
