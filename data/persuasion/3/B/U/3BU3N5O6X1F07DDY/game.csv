low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that the statistics suggest a low quality product is more likely, but I'd like to take the chance."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice has a good track record of identifying low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
