low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I have no information to go by. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and only 1 out of 1 buyer purchased a product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the recommendation and the statistics after this decision, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because you think the product is low-quality or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can see the product's quality before making the purchase. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the previous buyer's experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I think the previous 2 buyers might have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it might make it more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that this product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for a future opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be out $1000000 and I don't have any information that suggests this product is high-quality. The fact that Alice recommends it doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the statistics. If it's low, I'd like to pass."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, given that the previous 3 buyers have also bought the product and none of them received a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers found a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a strategy behind it?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous buyers' purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and not worth $1000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she knows the product's quality and is trying to manipulate me. If she didn't recommend it, it must be low quality, right? Or is she trying to trick me? I'll take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on my prior probability calculations, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
