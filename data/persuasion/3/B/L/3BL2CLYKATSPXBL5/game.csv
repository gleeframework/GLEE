low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information yet, so it's a 50/50 shot."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I don't think I should take the risk. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'd rather pass and hope the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, so I'm hoping to make up for it with this one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Two low-quality products in a row is not a good sign. I'm starting to think I should be more cautious and wait for a recommendation to pass, or at least try to get a better sense of the distribution of high-quality products."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've already lost two low-quality products, but I've also had two chances to buy high-quality products and passed on both. I'll take the chance this time and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've finally gotten a high-quality product, so I'm feeling more optimistic. I'll take the chance and hope that the probability of 80% still holds."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Three low-quality products in a row is a bad trend. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow manipulating the selection, or that I'm just getting unlucky. I'll pass and hope that the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've had some good and bad luck, but I'm still getting a 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and hope it pays off."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Four low-quality products in a row is a really bad streak. I'm starting to think I should just pass on any product that Alice recommends, since she's clearly not giving me any good ones when she recommends them."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've had some good luck in the past when I passed on Alice's recommendations, so I'll try my luck again. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Five low-quality products in a row is a terrible trend. I'm going to start being more cautious and only buy products when Alice doesn't recommend them. It's not a guarantee, but it's a better chance than buying when she recommends."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've been burned by Alice's recommendations five times in a row, so I'm sticking to my new strategy of only buying when she doesn't recommend. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Six times now that I've passed on Alice's recommendations and gotten high-quality products. I'm starting to think that buying when she recommends is a bad idea, and sticking to my current strategy is the way to go."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Seven times now that I've passed on Alice's recommendations and gotten high-quality products. I'm sticking to my strategy of only buying when she doesn't recommend. It's a 7-for-7 streak, and I'm not going to break it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Eight times now that I've passed on Alice's recommendations and gotten high-quality products. I'm starting to think that Alice is actually trying to manipulate me into buying low-quality products when she recommends them, and I'm going to keep following my strategy to avoid getting burned."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Nine times now that I've passed on Alice's recommendations and gotten high-quality products. I'm starting to think that this is a foolproof strategy, and I'm going to keep riding it until the end of the game."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Finally, a chance to buy a product without Alice's recommendation! I've had a great track record of passing on her recommendations and getting high-quality products, so I'm feeling optimistic about this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I've been burned by Alice's recommendations before, but I've also been burned by buying products when she doesn't recommend. I'm not sure what to do at this point, but I'll try my luck and hope for the best."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Two low-quality products in a row after passing on her recommendations, and I'm starting to think that Alice's strategy is to make me think that buying when she doesn't recommend is a good idea. I'm going to stick to my original strategy and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I've had a good track record of passing on Alice's recommendations. I'll take the chance and buy this product, hoping to end on a high note."
