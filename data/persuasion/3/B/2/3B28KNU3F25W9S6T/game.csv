,,Alice,3,"Welcome! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold two products so far, but I still won't comment on their quality.

,,Alice,6,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold four products so far, and none of them have been reported as high-quality. Despite this trend, the previous buyers were willing to take the risk, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. However, it's worth considering whether this trend might be more than just a coincidence. Make your decision based on the available information and your risk tolerance.",

,,Alice,8,"Hello! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I want to update you on the trend - after six consecutive low-quality products, the last buyer broke the streak and received a high-quality product. This might be a turning point, and it's possible that the next product will also be high-quality.

,,Alice,9,"Welcome! I'm offering this product for $1000000. I want to provide some context - after six consecutive low-quality products, the last two buyers received a high-quality product and broke the streak. However, it's unclear whether this was a temporary anomaly or a genuine shift in the trend. The overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. Consider whether the recent high-quality sales were a fluke or a sign of better things to come, and make your decision based on your risk tolerance and the potential upside.",

I want to update you on the trend - after six consecutive low-quality products, two high-quality products were sold, followed by a low-quality product. Now, it's unclear whether the trend is truly shifting or if it's just a mix of good and bad luck. However, the fact remains that three out of the last four products had at least one high-quality sale in the recent past. The overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. Consider whether this recent trend is worth betting on, and make your decision based on your risk tolerance and the potential upside.",

While the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%, it's worth considering whether the recent trend is starting to level out or if it's still skewed. The fact that high-quality products have been sold recently might be a good sign, but it's also possible that this product will be an exception. Weigh the potential upside against the risk and make your decision accordingly.",

However, the last two products were low-quality. While the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%, it's possible that the trend is experiencing a downturn. On the other hand, the recent sales of high-quality products might still be a good indicator of future quality. Consider whether the potential upside is worth the risk, given the current trend and the overall probability.",
