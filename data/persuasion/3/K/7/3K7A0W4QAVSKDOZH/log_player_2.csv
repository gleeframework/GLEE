Given that 7 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will update my prior probability of a product being high-quality to 1/8 = 12.5%. With Alice's recommendation, the probability that the product is high-quality given her recommendation is (1/3) * (1/8) = 1/24. However, the probability that the product is low-quality given her recommendation is (2/3) * (7/8) = 14/24. Therefore, I believe it is more likely that the product is low-quality.
