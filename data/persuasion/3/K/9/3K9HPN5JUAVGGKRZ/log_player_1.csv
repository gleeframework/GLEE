I'll sell it to you for $820,000, and I'll also give you a guarantee: if this product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you a $10,000 discount on your next purchase. What do you say?""}"

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and you're right to think that the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is at play here. With 4 high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the true probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 80%. I'll sell it to you for $780,000, and I'm willing to offer you a 10% bonus on the purchase price if you buy it now, which would bring the total to $862,000. What do you say?""}"

However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. With 4 high-quality products sold and 2 low-quality products rejected, it's possible that the low-quality products are simply a anomaly. I'll sell this one to you for $100,000, and I'll throw in a free inspection service to verify its quality. If it's indeed low-quality, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the offer, but I'll only pay $800000 for the product. I think the free inspection service is a nice touch, but I'm not convinced that the low-quality products are just an anomaly. I'd like to negotiate the price to reflect the risk.

However, I'd like to warn you that the 7 high-quality products sold and 3 low-quality products rejected don't necessarily mean that the next product will be high-quality.
