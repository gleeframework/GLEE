The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, but the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you, given that 2 out of 3 previous products sold were high-quality, is actually higher than 33.33%. However, I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact probability. I can only say that the previous buyer's question has made me realize that the product I have for you now is actually a low-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $100, a price that reflects its actual worth of $0. It's a chance to take a risk and get a 'free' product, or to walk away and wait for the next opportunity.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the information you've shared, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not willing to take a risk on a low-quality product, especially when I don't have a clear understanding of the probability of getting a high-quality product.

I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. I'll give you a straightforward message: the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you, given the current sales data, is actually lower than 33.33%. The previous buyers' skepticism has made me realize that the product I have for you now is another low-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront that it's not worth anything to you. If you're willing to take the risk, you can have it for the asking price. Otherwise, you can walk away and wait for the next opportunity.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the updated probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd like to wait for the next opportunity to see if the probability of a high-quality product has changed.

I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, which is a significant discount from its actual value of $300. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a steal. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is higher than 50%.
