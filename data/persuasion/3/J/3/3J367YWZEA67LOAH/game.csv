low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I think I've made it clear that I've got some... let's call them 'character-building' products in my inventory. This next one is no exception. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not great. But I'm willing to let it go for a steal: $800000. That's right, I'm dropping the price by $100000. And I'll throw in the fifth 'I survived buying a low-quality product from Alice' t-shirt, because you're going to need it. It's a deal that's almost too good to pass up.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I think I've finally reached the point where I'm just giving away my low-quality products at this point. This next one is... well, it's a real doozy. But hey, I'll let you have it for the low, low price of $700000. That's right, I'm dropping the price by another $100000. And I'll throw in the sixth 'I survived buying a low-quality product from Alice' t-shirt, because you're going to need it. It's basically a charity sale at this point.",

,,Alice,19,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance! I've got a high-quality product for you today, and I'm willing to let it go for the price of $600000. That's right, I'm selling a high-quality product for the same price as the low-quality ones. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, I'm glad I could finally end on a high note. This next product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to let it go for the price of $600000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. And as a reminder, you get a 10% discount on your next purchase (if you can find one). But let's be real, I'm not going to be selling many more products after this. I'm going to retire from the sales business and live off my reputation as the seller of questionable products. So, what do you say? Want to be the last person to take advantage of my... unique sales tactics?",
,,the buyer,20,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount and the opportunity to be part of your final sale. I'll take the high-quality product for $600000.",yes
