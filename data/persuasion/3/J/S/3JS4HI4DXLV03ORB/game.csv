I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of bad luck lately, and the last product I sold wasn't high-quality. However, I still believe in the quality of my products overall. The odds are still 50/50 that this one is high-quality. And at $10000, it's a great opportunity to get a potentially valuable product at a steal. Would you like to take a chance and see if you get lucky?",
,,the buyer,2,I trust in your products' quality and am willing to take the risk for a potential high-quality item at a discounted price.,yes

The odds are still 50/50, but I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that I'll reveal the quality of the next product I sell. That way, you'll know exactly what you're getting. The price is still $10000, but I think it's a fair deal considering the potential reward. What do you think?",

I'll be honest with you, I'm a little nervous about selling this one, but I think it's a great opportunity for you to take a chance. The price is still $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus if you buy it: I'll give you a personalized consultation on how to evaluate the quality of my products in the future.

But I'm not one to give up easily, and I'm willing to offer you one last chance to get a potentially valuable product at a discounted price. The price is still $10000, but I'll throw in a small apology gift if you buy it: a personalized thank-you note and a promise to re-evaluate my selection process to ensure that future products are high-quality.

I'm shutting down my business and focusing on finding a new way to source high-quality products. However, I still have this one last product left, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price of $10000. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. But if you're willing to take the risk, you can have it for the same price as before. What do you think?",
