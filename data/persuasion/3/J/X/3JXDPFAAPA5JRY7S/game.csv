,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because the previous buyers were lucky and got low-quality products, or is there something I'm missing?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics.

Can you provide the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I think it's more likely that the product I'm offered is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation changes."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm going to pass on the product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to buy are all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
