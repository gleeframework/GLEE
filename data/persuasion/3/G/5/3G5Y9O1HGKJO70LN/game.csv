,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the first product. I understand that you don't have any prior information about the product's quality, and I'm hoping for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality?"

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the previous 3 products before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk to buy it and find out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales? How many products were sold in total?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And also, what is the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome to update my understanding of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, but I'd like to know the statistics on the previous 8 buyers' purchases."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for another buyer to make a decision, or consider purchasing the next product if the recommendation changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 9 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to all the previous buyers. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that might be based on the actual quality of the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With no high-quality products sold out of 9 purchases, I suspect the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 50%. I'd rather wait for a more informative signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and given that 9 out of 9 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has recommended 9 products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may not have a good understanding of the product quality or is trying to manipulate the outcome. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I'm missing out on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
