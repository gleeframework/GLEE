high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a strong indication that the products are mostly low-quality, and I'm trying to test the probability of a high-quality product being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations.

I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products remaining in the inventory, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
