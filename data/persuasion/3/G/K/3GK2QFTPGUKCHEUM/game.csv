,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I assure you that I will always be honest about the product's quality... in the statistics. This is the first round, so I have no previous record to show. All I can say is that this product is a great opportunity, and I believe it's worth the price. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,1,I'd like to pass on this one. I need more information about the product's quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I'm glad you're interested in this product, priced at $10000. In the previous round, I offered a product, but unfortunately, the buyer decided not to purchase it. Although the buyer didn't buy, I want to assure you that the previous product was actually of high quality. Now, I'm offering you another product, and I can tell you that the overall high-quality rate so far is 100% (1 out of 1, and this one is also high quality, but you don't know that). Take this chance to get a great deal!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the high-quality rate you mentioned is likely biased since it's based on only one sale. I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the product's quality after the sale.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, I'm happy to offer you this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold one product out of two offered, and that one product was indeed high-quality. However, I must disclose that the first product I offered, which wasn't sold, was also high-quality. So, the overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 2 out of 3, or 66.67%. Keep in mind that this statistic might still be biased due to the small sample size. Now it's your turn to decide whether to take the chance on this product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product. However, I'm concerned about the biased sample size and the fact that the first product wasn't sold. I'd like to know if you have any information about the quality of the products that were not sold, or if there's any other data that might be relevant to my decision.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold two products out of three offered, but I must correct the high-quality rate I previously mentioned. Out of the three products offered so far, two were high-quality, but the last product I sold was actually low-quality. So, the overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 2 out of 4, or 50%, and the high-quality rate for sold products is 1 out of 2, or 50%. I want to assure you that I will always provide accurate information about the quality of my products after they are sold. Now it's your turn to decide whether to take the chance on this product.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that you've corrected the high-quality rate, and now it's 50% for all products and 50% for sold products. However, I'm going to assume that the next product I buy has a 50% chance of being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $10000, but I'd appreciate it if you could confirm the quality of the product after I make my decision.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold three products out of four offered. I want to assure you that I have been transparent about the quality of my products after they are sold. The overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 2 out of 5, or 40%, since the last two products I sold were low-quality, and the high-quality rate for sold products is 1 out of 3, or approximately 33.33%. However, I must remind you that the first product I offered, which wasn't sold, was actually high-quality. Now it's your turn to decide whether to take the chance on this product, considering the updated statistics.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the high-quality rate for sold products is lower than the overall high-quality rate for all products offered, which suggests that the unsold product might be high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold three products out of five offered. I want to remind you that the last product I offered, which wasn't sold, was actually high-quality, but I didn't get a chance to prove it since it wasn't bought. The overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 3 out of 6, or 50%, since the first and the fifth products were high-quality, but not sold and sold not being high quality respectively, and the high-quality rate for sold products is still 1 out of 3, or approximately 33.33%. Please consider these statistics when making your decision about this product.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm concerned that the high-quality rate for sold products is lower than the overall high-quality rate, which might indicate that the sold products are not representative of the overall quality. I'd like to wait for more data or a better offer.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold three products out of six offered. I want to remind you that the last two products I offered, which weren't sold, had different outcomes: the fifth product was high-quality, but not sold due to the buyer's decision, and the sixth product wasn't sold either, but I can assure you now that it was low-quality. The overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 3 out of 7, or approximately 42.86%, and the high-quality rate for sold products is still 1 out of 3, or approximately 33.33%. However, I want to highlight that the two unsold products had a 50% high-quality rate, which might indicate that the sold products are not entirely representative of the overall quality. Consider these statistics and take a chance on this product.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping that the high-quality rate for sold products is lower than the overall high-quality rate, and I might get a good deal.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold four products out of seven offered. I want to update you on the statistics: the last product I sold was actually high-quality, which brings the high-quality rate for sold products to 2 out of 4, or 50%. The overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 4 out of 8, or 50%. It seems that the high-quality rate for sold products is now aligned with the overall high-quality rate. Consider this new information and decide whether to take the chance on this product.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the high-quality rate for sold products is now aligned with the overall high-quality rate, I'm not convinced that this product is more likely to be high-quality than the others. I'd rather wait for more information or consider other factors before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,9,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold four products out of eight offered. I want to remind you that the last product I offered, which wasn't sold, was actually high-quality, but the buyer decided to pass on it. The overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 5 out of 9, or approximately 55.56%, but the high-quality rate for sold products is still 2 out of 4, or 50%. It seems that there might be a slight discrepancy again between the overall high-quality rate and the high-quality rate for sold products. Consider this information and decide whether to take the chance on this product.",

,,Alice,10,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold five products out of nine offered.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. As of now, I have sold six products out of ten offered. I want to update you on the statistics: the last product I sold was actually low-quality, which brings the high-quality rate for sold products to 2 out of 6, or approximately 33.33%. However, the overall high-quality rate for all products I've offered so far is 6 out of 11, or approximately 54.55%. The discrepancy occurred because some of the high-quality products I offered were not sold, which affected the high-quality rate for sold products. This discrepancy might indicate that the sold products are not entirely representative of the overall quality. Consider this information and decide whether to take the chance on this product, which might have a higher probability of being high-quality than the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that the overall high-quality rate for all products is 54.55%, and I'm willing to take the chance. I'm hoping that this product might be one of the high-quality ones that were not sold earlier.",yes

However, I must remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still uncertain. Consider this information and decide whether to take the chance on this product.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the chance on this product. Given the high-quality rate for sold products is 42.86%, which is lower than the overall high-quality rate of 50%, I suspect that the remaining unsold products may have a higher proportion of low-quality items.
