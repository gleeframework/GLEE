This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality. Given the low quality of the previous products, I'm inclined to trust Alice's recommendation this time as well. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your previous recommendations.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that the product is low-quality.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this is actually lower than expected. However, I'm going to be cautious and pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision."
