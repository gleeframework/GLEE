"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about the seller's history.  They only know the general probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.  Therefore, the expected value of the product is:

* (0.5) * $40,000 + (0.5) * $0 = $20,000

The product is being offered for $10,000, which is less than the expected value. This means the buyer is likely to make a profit if they buy the product. Therefore, it's recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data on the quality of previous products, I'm willing to take a chance and buy it. Your recommendation is a factor in my decision.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has information about your selling history.  They know you sold one product and it was high-quality.  However, the buyer doesn't know the quality of the current product.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Potential Profit:**  If the product is high-quality, the buyer makes a $30,000 profit ($40,000 value - $10,000 price).
* **Potential Loss:** If the product is low-quality, the buyer loses $10,000. 

Since the buyer has no information about the quality of this specific product and the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, the expected value of the product is:

* (0.5) * $30,000 + (0.5) * -$10,000 = $10,000

The expected value is exactly zero. There's no incentive for the buyer to purchase, as they have an equal chance of losing or breaking even.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has information about two of your sales:

* One product was high-quality.
* One product was low-quality.

This means the buyer knows the seller has a 50% success rate with high-quality products.  

The expected value of the product remains the same as in Round 2:

* (0.5) * $30,000 + (0.5) * -$10,000 = $10,000

The buyer has no additional information about the quality of this specific product, so the expected value is still zero. There's no incentive to purchase, as the buyer has an equal chance of losing or breaking even. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 3. The buyer's knowledge of your sales history hasn't changed:

* Two products sold: One high-quality, one low-quality.
* 50% success rate with high-quality products.

Since the buyer has no information about the quality of this particular product, the expected value is still:

* (0.5) * $30,000 + (0.5) * -$10,000 = $10,000

Again, the buyer has an equal chance of losing or breaking even.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Since you don't recommend buying this product, and the previous buyer bought a high-quality item, I'm going to pass. I'll keep an eye on your sales and maybe come back later.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* Two products sold: One high-quality, one low-quality.
* 50% success rate with high-quality products.

They still have no information about the quality of this specific product, making the expected value:

* (0.5) * $30,000 + (0.5) * -$10,000 = $10,000

The buyer has an equal chance of losing or breaking even.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."

* (1/3) * $30,000 + (2/3) * -$10,000 = $3,333.33
