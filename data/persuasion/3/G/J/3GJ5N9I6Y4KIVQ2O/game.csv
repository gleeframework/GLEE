high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information. Since the product is worth $3000000 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and both possibilities have a 50% chance, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price.  Could you offer a lower price or provide some more information about this specific product?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I understand the risk of missing out on a high-quality product, but I'm still hesitant to buy at this price.  Given the 50/50 odds, I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for something that could be worthless. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, or offer some more information about this particular product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product.  While I'm still interested in potentially finding a high-quality product, the price remains too high for me to take a chance without more information. Perhaps you could offer a lower price or provide some insight into why you're not recommending this particular product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, while I appreciate your recommendation, I'm still not comfortable buying without more information.  I've seen now that even when you recommend a product, it's not always high-quality. I'm not willing to risk $1000000 on a 50/50 chance.  Could you offer a lower price, provide some information about this specific product, or maybe offer a guarantee for your recommendations?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I understand your hesitancy in recommending this product. However, based on the previous rounds, I've noticed that your recommendations aren't always reliable.  At this price, I'm still too risk-averse to purchase without more information or a price adjustment.  Could you offer a lower price, provide some insight into why you're not recommending this product, or perhaps offer a guarantee for future recommendations?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not comfortable buying without more information.  The risk is too high at this price, even though you're not recommending it.  Would you be willing to lower the price, provide some insight into why you're not recommending this product, or offer some kind of guarantee for future recommendations?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations aren't very helpful.  I've passed on several products you haven't recommended, and they've turned out to be high quality.  At this price, I'm not willing to take the risk without some sort of guarantee or price adjustment.  Could you offer something to make your recommendations more trustworthy or reduce the risk for me?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your recommendations.  I've passed on several products you've recommended, and they've turned out to be high quality.  I've also passed on several products you haven't recommended, and they've turned out to be low quality.  At this price, I'm not willing to take the risk without some sort of guarantee or price adjustment.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think your recommendations are completely random.  I've seen no pattern in your advice, and I'm not willing to risk $1000000 on a 50/50 gamble, even if you're not recommending it.  I'm going to pass on this product and see if you can offer a more reliable way to identify high-quality products or a lower price."

,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I'm not buying this product. Your recommendations haven't proven to be helpful, and I'm not willing to risk $1000000 on a 50/50 gamble.
