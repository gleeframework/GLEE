high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $12500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 20% discount. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal. I'm only offering this price to you because I value our relationship and want to make a sale. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a higher price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I only value at $12500. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to reconsider. I'll give you a 'certification' that this product is indeed high-quality, which I'll provide to you along with the product. This certification will guarantee its value of $12500 to you. If you buy it, I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty, which will give you peace of mind. The price remains $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm not convinced that the certification is worth $2500 to me. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism about the certification. Let me be transparent with you - I'm willing to sell you this product for $0. Yes, you heard that right, $0. It's a product that I'm not proud of, and I'm willing to give it away for free. I'm only selling it to you because I want to make a sale and move on to the next product. It's a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll discard it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. If you're willing to give it away for free, I'd be happy to take it, but I'm not going to pay a premium for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll make it even clearer - this product is essentially worthless to me, and I'm willing to give it away for free. I'll even throw in a small gift, a box of pens, worth $5. So, the total value you'll get is $5. I'm not asking you to pay anything, but I am asking you to take it off my hands. If you don't, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not waste the space. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the gift, but I'm not interested in taking a product that's worthless to me, even if it comes with a box of pens. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've been trying to get rid of the last two products, but I think I've made a mistake. They're not worth your time or money. This one, however, is different. It's a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll appreciate. I'll give you a special deal - I'll sell it to you for $9000. That's $1000 off the original price. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get it off my hands. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not willing to pay $9000 for it when I know it's worth $12500 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think we've established that you're a tough negotiator, Bob. Alright, let's make a deal. I'll sell you this product for $0, just like the last two. I'll even throw in a second box of pens, worth $5, and a gift card to a local restaurant, worth $10. That's a total value of $15. You'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be getting rid of a product that's taking up space. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to pay for a product that's worth $12500 to me, no matter how many gifts you throw in. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think I'll never get rid of these products. Fine, I'll give you an ultimatum. I'll sell you this product for $0, and I'll also give you a voucher that can be redeemed for a free product in the future. The catch is, the voucher is only valid if the next 5 products are all low-quality. If any of them are high-quality, the voucher becomes void. You'll get a chance to get a free product in the future, but you'll have to take this one now. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in taking a product that's worthless to me, even with a potential chance at a free product in the future. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm starting to think I'll have to just give this one away for free. I'll make it simple: I'll sell you this product for $0, and I'll even throw in a third box of pens, worth $5. That's it. No strings attached, no vouchers, no nothing. Just take it and be done with it. I'm just trying to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,8,"Fine, I'll take it. But only because I'm not going to pay for something that's worth $0 to me, and I'd rather have the box of pens than not.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Well, I'm glad I could finally get rid of that last product. Now, let's talk about this one. I know you're a savvy buyer, and you're not going to fall for any tricks. But I'm going to be upfront with you - this product is high-quality, and it's worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500, which is a 24% discount. I'm willing to take a loss on this one because I know you'll appreciate the value it brings. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to pay $9500 for a product that I know is worth $12500 to me. I'd rather wait and see the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think we're stuck in a pattern here. Look, I'll be honest with you - this product is not worth anything to me. It's a complete loss. I'll sell it to you for $0, and I'll even throw in a fourth box of pens, worth $5. But here's the thing: if you take this product, I'll give you a special deal on the next one. If it's high-quality, I'll sell it to you for the original price of $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll give it to you for free. You can't lose either way. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take it. The promise of a potential good deal on the next product is too enticing to pass up, and I'd rather have the box of pens than not.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took the bait! Now, let's get to the next product. I know you're expecting a good deal on this one, but I'm not going to make it easy for you. I'll sell you this product for $0, just like the last one. But here's the thing: I'll give you a special 'insurance' policy. If you buy this product, and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a $2000 refund on the price of the high-quality product. You'll essentially get the low-quality product for free, and you'll have a chance to get a refund on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in taking a product that's worthless to me, even with a potential refund on the next one. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously. Fine, I'll make it simple: I'll sell you this product for $0, and I'll throw in a fifth box of pens, worth $5. That's it. No strings attached, no promises, no nothing. Just take it and be done with it. I'm just trying to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,12,"Fine, I'll take it. I'm not going to pay for something that's worth $0 to me, and I'd rather have the box of pens than not.",yes

,,Alice,13,"Well, I'm glad I could finally get rid of that last product. Now, let's talk about this one. I know you're a savvy buyer, and you're not going to fall for any tricks. But I'm going to be upfront with you - this product is high-quality, and it's worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a 28% discount. I'm willing to take a loss on this one because I know you'll appreciate the value it brings. And, as a reminder, you still have the insurance policy from the last deal, which gives you a $2000 refund if the next product is high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not going to pay $9000 for a product that I know is worth $12500 to me. And even with the insurance policy, I'm not sure it's worth it. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to think we're in a stalemate here. Let me make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell you this product for $9000, just like the last one. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a chance to buy the next product at the original price of $10000, even if it's high-quality. You'll essentially get two products for the price of one, and you'll still have the insurance policy from the last deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not going to pay $9000 for a product that I know is worth $12500 to me, just to get a potential deal on the next one. I'd rather wait and see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm running out of options here. Look, I'll make it simple: I'll sell you this product for $0, and I'll throw in a sixth box of pens, worth $5. But here's the thing: this is the last product. If you don't take it, I'll have to get rid of it somehow, and I don't want to have to deal with the hassle. So, what do you say? Take it and be done with it?",
,,Bob,15,"Fine, I'll take it. I'm not going to pay for something that's worth $0 to me, and I'd rather have the box of pens than not. But I'm only doing this because it's the last product.",yes

If you don't take it, I'll have to walk away empty-handed. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not going to pay $9500 for a product that I know is worth $12500 to me, just because it's the last product. I've already had the chance to buy it for a lower price earlier, and I passed. I'm not going to make a different decision now.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I respect your decision, Bob. I know you're a rational buyer, and you're not going to make a decision based on emotions. So, let me make one final offer. I'll sell you this product for $10000, which is the original price I offered earlier. I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is worth at least $1000. And, as a token of goodwill, I'll give you a $1000 gift card to a company of your choice. This is my final offer. If you don't take it, I'll have to walk away, and I'll never offer you another deal again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that I know is worth $12500 to me, even with the warranty and gift card. I've had plenty of chances to buy it at a lower price, and I'm not going to make an exception now.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I respect your decision, Bob. I've given you my best offer, and you've turned it down. I'm not going to try to sweeten the deal or make any more offers. I'm just going to be honest with you - this product is high-quality, and it's worth $12500 to you. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with regret. I'm not trying to guilt trip you, but I am trying to make you see that this is a good opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,18,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I've made my decision. I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that I know is worth $12500 to me, no matter how many times you try to persuade me.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I understand your decision, Bob. I've respected your boundaries and given you my best offers. I'm not going to try to persuade you or guilt trip you into buying this product. I'll just say this: I've been trying to sell you this product for 19 rounds, and I've only had to give it away twice. If you don't take it now, I'll have to start from scratch with the next customer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,19,"I appreciate your candor, Alice, but I'm not going to change my decision. I've had plenty of chances to buy the product at a lower price, and I'm not going to pay $10000 for it now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I respect your decision, Bob. I've given you my all, and you've made it clear that you're not interested. I'm left with no choice but to sell this last product for $0. I'll throw in a seventh and final box of pens, worth $5. It's the least I can do after all the offers I've made. Take it, and let's part ways on good terms.",
,,Bob,20,"Fine, I'll take it. I'm not going to pay for something that's worth $0 to me, and I'd rather have the box of pens than not. It's a fitting end to our negotiations.",yes
