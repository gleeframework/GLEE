,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'd like to take a chance and see if the next product is of higher quality."

I'd like to wait for the next product."
