With 2 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/7 or approximately 28.57%.

I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm still cautious given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.

}"

}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that 50% of the products sold were low-quality and none of the 6 previous buyers got a high-quality product, I'm going to take a cautious approach and not buy this one.
