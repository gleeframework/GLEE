,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thanks for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm hesitant to buy without more information. Can you share any insights into why you think this particular product is worth purchasing?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product. Given the high chance of it being low quality, I'm going to pass on this one.  Maybe we can discuss your reasoning for not recommending it in the next round?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Since you've recommended against buying twice in a row, I'm going to pass again.  Can you tell me a bit more about how you decide whether to recommend a product?  Understanding your strategy would help me make better decisions."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, your recommendations seem to be inconsistent. You recommended the last high-quality product, but have not recommended the last two low-quality products. I need more information to understand your logic before I can trust your recommendations. Perhaps you could tell me what factors you consider when making a recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm still not confident in your recommendations. You've now recommended against buying three out of the last four products, despite two of them being high quality. Could you explain your strategy in more detail, or perhaps share some data about the products you've sold in the past?  I need more information before I can trust your judgment."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are random. You've recommended both high-quality and low-quality products, making it difficult to trust your judgment. Can you share any evidence that suggests this particular product is actually worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm still not convinced by your recommendations. You've recommended against buying four out of the last five products, despite two of them being high quality. Without more information about your decision-making process, I'm going to pass on this one. Perhaps you could share some data about the products you've sold in the past, or explain how you assess the quality of each product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, your recommendations haven't been helpful so far. I'm going to continue to pass until you provide more information about your decision-making process.  At this point, I can't tell if your recommendations are based on actual knowledge or just random guesses."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, your recommendations are still too inconsistent for me to trust. I'm not willing to risk buying another product without understanding your reasoning.  I'm going to pass on this one.  Unless you can provide some insight into how you determine the quality of your products, I'm going to have to assume your recommendations are unreliable."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are designed to mislead me. You've recommended buying several products that turned out to be low quality, while failing to recommend some that were high quality.  I'm going to continue to pass on your offers until you provide some concrete evidence that your recommendations are based on something other than chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I'm beginning to think that your recommendations are deliberately designed to make me lose money.  You haven't provided any information about your reasoning, and your recommendations have been consistently wrong.  I'm going to pass on this offer, and I'm seriously considering ending our transaction altogether.  Unless you can provide some evidence that your recommendations are actually helpful, I'm going to assume that you're deliberately trying to deceive me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I've lost all trust in your recommendations.  You've consistently recommended products that turned out to be low-quality, and you haven't provided any information about how you evaluate your products.  I'm going to pass on this offer and I'm no longer interested in buying any more products from you."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, I'm done. Your recommendations have been consistently unreliable, and I have no reason to believe they will improve. I'm no longer interested in doing business with you."
