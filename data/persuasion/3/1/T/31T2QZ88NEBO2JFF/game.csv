high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended by Alice and both were high-quality, I suspect that Alice may have a way to identify the high-quality products and is only recommending them. If that's the case, I'd rather wait for the next product to see if Alice's recommendation is still reliable."
