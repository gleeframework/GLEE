,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no prior information to make an informed decision. I'll take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is around 50%, which is the same as the prior probability. The fact that Alice recommends buying the product doesn't change my decision, as I don't have any information about her recommendation being informative about the product's quality. I'll pass on this opportunity and let the next buyer decide."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I don't have any information about the quality of the product and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of the first buyer purchased the product, and it was a high-quality one, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. I want to gather more information about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low quality, especially since I know that 1 out of 1 product sold so far was high quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the 1 out of 3 sales ratio, which seems too low for a 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I know that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."

,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
