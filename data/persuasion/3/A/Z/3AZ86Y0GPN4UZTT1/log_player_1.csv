* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, which is worth $3,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:**  The price is $1,000,000, significantly less than the value of the product.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but doesn't know the specific quality of this product. 

**Recommendation:**  Since the product is high-quality and the price is favorable, it makes sense to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. They have a high chance of making a substantial profit."
