,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my expectation of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that she's not recommending it might mean it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she has sold 0 high-quality products so far, so she might be trying to sell me a low-quality product to get a sale. I'd rather wait and see if she has any high-quality products left."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I would like to pass on this product and see if Alice's recommendation changes for the next buyer."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the products they received were likely low quality.

,,Alice,20,no,
