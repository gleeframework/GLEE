Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product other than Alice's recommendation, and the product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $12,500) and 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0), it's a gamble. However, it's better to buy the product since the potential reward ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."

**Explanation:**
