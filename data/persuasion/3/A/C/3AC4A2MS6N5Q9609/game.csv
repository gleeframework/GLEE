,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it.

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 80% chance. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have rejected the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the initial 80% and the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the initial 20%. I'll pass on this product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80.00%. However, given the lack of successful sales, I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable. I'd like to wait for more data or consider the product's quality on my own."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,18,yes,
