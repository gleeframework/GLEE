Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
We still have no information about the buyer's preferences, and since they chose to pass on the previous product, we can't gain any information from their behavior. It is too early to recommend buying, especially with a 50% chance of it being low-quality.  We'll need more data to determine if the buyer will find the product valuable."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Since there's no sales history yet and you're not recommending the product, I'm going to pass for now.  Let me see how things play out with other buyers.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

The situation remains the same. We have no information about the buyer's preferences, and they have passed on the first two products.  It's too risky to recommend buying without any data to suggest the buyer would find the product valuable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no historical data to suggest the quality of your products, I'm going to pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation remains the same as in the previous rounds. We have no information about the buyer's preferences, and they have passed on the first three products.  There's no reason to believe this buyer will be any different from the previous ones, and recommending the product would be too risky.  We need more data to assess the buyer's willingness to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no data yet, I will pass on this product.  I'm interested in seeing how the quality of the products sold unfolds, then I'll reconsider.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We still lack information about the buyer's preferences. All previous buyers have passed on the product, suggesting they might be looking for a specific type of quality or have a very high valuation for high-quality products.  Without this information, recommending the product is risky, as there is a 50% chance it could be low-quality. We need more data before making a recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no sales record yet, I can't be sure about the quality of the product.  As you are not recommending it, I'm going to pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We still have no indication of what buyers are willing to pay for the products.  Every buyer so far has passed on the product. Since the product quality is random (50% chance of high-quality), recommending purchase is still too risky.  We need data suggesting buyers are willing to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Since there is no prior sales data and you are not recommending the product, I'll pass on this one.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We still lack information about the buyer's preferences. The pattern of the previous buyers passing on the product suggests that they are looking for a specific quality or have a very high valuation for high-quality products. With no sales history to rely on, recommending the product is too risky due to the 50% chance of it being low-quality. More data is needed to determine if the buyer would find the product valuable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since this is the first product and there is no data to suggest a pattern, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see how future buyers fare before making a purchase.
