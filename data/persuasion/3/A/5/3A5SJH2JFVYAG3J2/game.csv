,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000, considering the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products is higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, it seems like she has been recommending low-quality products to buyers who have purchased. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality so I can get a good deal."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 4 buyers. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is low."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it seems like the products being sold so far are not representative of the overall distribution. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not buy the product, and given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
