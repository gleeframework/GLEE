**Explanation:**

* **The data suggests high quality:** The sales record shows that 4 out of 4 products sold were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which strongly suggests that Alice is recommending only high-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While the risk of getting a low-quality product still exists, the potential reward of a $20,000 product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information provided. In a real-world scenario, there are other factors to consider, such as the trustworthiness of the seller and the potential for hidden information."
