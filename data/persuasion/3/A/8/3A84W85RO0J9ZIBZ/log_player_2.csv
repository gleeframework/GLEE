Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to have you here. As you may know, my track record shows that 50% of my products are high-quality. But I'm going to make it even more interesting. I'll give you a chance to make an educated guess about the quality of this product. If you think it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% chance to get it at the discounted price of $90.

I've sold a total of 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. But I want to make it more enticing for you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special bonus - you'll get to know the quality of the product before making a decision. If it's high-quality, you can choose to buy it at the regular price of $100. If it's low-quality, you can simply walk away and I'll refund your $100. What do you think? Is the bonus enough to take the risk?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! I'm happy to share some information about my previous buyers. The first buyer I sold to was someone who was guaranteed a high-quality product, and they ended up getting a high-quality product. The second buyer took a chance and guessed the quality correctly, and they also got a high-quality product. The third buyer was more cautious and decided not to buy, and they ended up getting a low-quality product. As for the current product, I'll be honest with you - it's not high-quality. But I'm still offering it to you at the fixed price of $100. It's not a bad deal, considering the price of similar products on the market. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this one?
