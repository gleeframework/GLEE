,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the outcome of Alice's previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as the statistics are neutral and I don't have any information to base my decision on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low success rate so far and Alice's recommendation, but I want to negotiate the price. Can we discuss a discount?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that Alice hasn't recommended it yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is there a reason you think it's low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, which suggests that the products they saw were likely low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's possible that this product is also low-quality, in which case I'll get a good deal. If it's high-quality, I'll still get a good deal, but I'll be the one taking on the risk. I'm willing to take that risk because I think the potential upside outweighs the potential downside."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice has recommended 4 low-quality products so far, given that 4 out of 4 products were low quality. I'm concerned that this might be a pattern and the product might also be low quality."
