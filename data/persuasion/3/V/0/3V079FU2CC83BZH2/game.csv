high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the previous 2 buyers passed on the products and you recommended them to buy. I'd like to calculate the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me before making my decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, I've seen that 2 products have been offered and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the current product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the product's quality after my purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I will pass on the product and let Alice know that I'm skeptical about the quality of the product based on the sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision, as I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the current product might be high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation."
