**Reasoning:**

Since only one product has been sold so far, and it was high quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendation system is performing well. Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0)."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is strong:** With a 100% success rate of high-quality products sold based on Alice's recommendations, it's highly likely that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice has perfect information:** Since Alice knows the true value of each product, her recommendation is valuable. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Passing on the product means missing out on a potentially high-value product.

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence from Alice's previous recommendations makes it a worthwhile gamble."
