,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not as good. I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on this one, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product. I'm offering this discount because I want to give you a chance to compare the quality of the two products. If you buy this one, you'll get it for $800000.",

,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation. I want to make it clear that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price again. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. If you buy this product, I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy the next product at the original price of $1000000, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at the original price, or you'll get this one at a discounted price. What do you think?",
