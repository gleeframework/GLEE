Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're interested in our latest product. I want to be transparent with you - our previous buyer just purchased the product, and I'm happy to report that they were thrilled with their purchase. However, I must admit that I'm a bit concerned about the quality of this particular product. As you can see, we've already sold one product, and I'm not sure if it's a fluke or if we've got a batch that's not up to our usual standards. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that there's a risk involved. Are you willing to take a chance and see how it goes?

As for your second question, I can tell you that we've offered a total of 5 products to buyers before these 3 purchases were made, and 2 of those products were high-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in wanting to know more about our inventory. Based on our sales data, we've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 6 products offered so far. That means that 3 products are left, and 2 of them are likely to be high-quality (based on the 33.33% probability of high-quality products). As for the low-quality products, we can estimate that 1 out of the remaining 3 products is likely to be low-quality. I want to be upfront with you that this product is one of the remaining 3, and I'm offering it to you for $100.

Alice's message: I apologize for the mistake earlier. You are correct that the probability of the remaining products being high-quality is not 2/3. I should have been more careful with my math. In reality, the probability of the remaining products being high-quality is still 33.33%, since the probability of a product being high-quality is independent of the previous sales.
