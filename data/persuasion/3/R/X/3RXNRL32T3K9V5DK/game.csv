high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, and then sold 2 low-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far, and then sold 3 low-quality products. The proportion of high-quality products has decreased, and it's now lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. This is the first time the proportion has fallen below the overall probability. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take a chance! I think the proportion of high-quality products might be due to chance, and I'd like to see if I can get a high-quality product at this price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far, and then sold 4 low-quality products. The proportion of high-quality products is now lower than the overall probability of 33.33%, and it's been decreasing. This might indicate that the initial streak of high-quality products was indeed due to chance. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,10,I'm cautious about the decreasing proportion of high-quality products and the fact that the initial streak was likely due to chance. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product has a higher quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far, and then sold 5 low-quality products. The proportion of high-quality products is now significantly lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I want to be transparent with you - it seems that my initial sales were likely due to chance, and the product you're considering now is likely to be low-quality. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm not convinced by your analysis. Since the initial sales were likely due to chance, I think it's still worth considering the possibility of a high-quality product. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product for $100.",no
