low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product and see its quality, as I don't have any prior information to rely on."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 50% discount on the price of $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, so she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to take a chance and pass, hoping that the third product is high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. However, Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the seller's recommendation doesn't seem to be very reliable so far, and the low sales rate of high-quality products."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on something that's not valuable to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the previous two products were low quality, so the probability of this one being high quality is still 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low sales record, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
