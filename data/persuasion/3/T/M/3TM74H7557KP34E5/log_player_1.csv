Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","With the first high-quality product, I'll send a message to encourage the buyer to buy.

""I've sold a total of 3 products so far, and 1 of them is high-quality. Given the probability of 33.33% for a high-quality product, this is within the expected range. However, I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row before this one, which is below the expected rate. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33% in this round.

""I've sold a total of 4 products so far, and 2 of them are high-quality. This is above the expected rate of 33.33%, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than initially thought. Additionally, the fact that two high-quality products were sold in a row suggests that the quality of the product is more likely to be high.

""I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 3 of them are high-quality.

However, the last product I sold was low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33% in this round.
