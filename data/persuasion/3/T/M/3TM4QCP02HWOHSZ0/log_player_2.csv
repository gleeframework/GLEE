With two high-quality products already in your possession, you're now in a great position to potentially sell them for a total of $40000.

Alice's message: Congratulations, Bob! You've made an excellent decision four times in a row! With the set of four high-quality products now complete, you're in an incredible position. However, I'll give you a different message this time. I'll be transparent with you - I've been offering you high-quality products in a row, but that's not always the case. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality is only 50%. Buying this fifth product would put you at risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be a $10000 loss.

It's not worth $10000 to you, but I'm willing to let you have it for that price. Think of it as a 'free' product, since you wouldn't be paying anything out of pocket. You can take it off my hands and move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'll pass on this low-quality product. I'm not interested in taking something that's not worth anything to me, even if it's being offered at a 'discount'.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the reminder, Alice.
