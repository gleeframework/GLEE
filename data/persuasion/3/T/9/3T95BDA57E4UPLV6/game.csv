low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you recommended against it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't have any information about my valuation, and I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%)."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%, and I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me why you're not recommending it. Is there something I should know about the product or the sales record?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and 5 out of 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you recommended not to buy it. This means that the product is likely to be low-quality, and I'm taking a chance. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were able to get a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I infer that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I would like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them sold a high-quality product, it seems that Alice is being cautious and only recommends low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't have enough information to justify the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low recommendation rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping for a low-quality product, which would mean I wouldn't lose $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many products were sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 previous buyers did not get a high-quality product, and considering the low probability of getting a high-quality product, I will pass on this product."
