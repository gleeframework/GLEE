Alice's message: You're right to question the probability! With 2 low-quality products out of 3 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd say it's more like 33.33% now. You might want to think carefully before buying from me.

I've got 15 products left in stock, and I'm not sure what the next 15 will be. But I'll give you a hint: the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 2:5.

Alice's message: You want to know more about the previous buyers, huh? Well, I'll give you a brief rundown. Buyer 1 got a low-quality product and took a risk, Buyer 2 passed on the product after I mentioned I was selling mostly low-quality ones, Buyer 3 got a low-quality product, Buyer 4 passed on the product after questioning my probability, Buyer 5 got a low-quality product, Buyer 6 got a high-quality product, and Buyer 7 passed on the product after I gave them a hint about the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products. Now, with 3 high-quality products out of 8 attempts, the probability of this product being high-quality is 37.5%.

Alice's message: You're a curious buyer, I like that! After re-examining my sales data, I've noticed that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 attempts, and 5 low-quality products out of 9 attempts. The remaining 14 products are still a mystery, but I'll give you a hint: I've noticed that I'm more likely to sell high-quality products when I've had a streak of low-quality sales. It's like I'm trying to balance out the odds. With this in mind, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 40%. But keep in mind that this is just a hunch, and you're still taking a risk by buying from me.
