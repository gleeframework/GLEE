"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and this product is indeed high-quality, recommending the purchase is the best strategy. 

The buyer has no information about this specific product, so they'll likely base their decision on the overall probability of a high-quality product, which is favorable."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Success:** The buyer in round 1 purchased the product, which was high-quality. This successful sale will likely increase the buyer's trust in your selection process. 
* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is also high-quality.  
* **No Information:** The buyer still has no information about this specific product, but the previous successful sale makes them more likely to trust your recommendation. 

Therefore, recommending the purchase is still the best strategy to maximize profit."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Success:**  The first two buyers purchased the product and were satisfied as they were both high quality. This strengthens the perception of your selection process as reliable.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a difficult decision, as the buyer is increasingly trusting your recommendations. However, your primary objective is to make profit, and selling a low-quality product for $10,000 would be a significant loss.

* **High Risk:**  Selling a low-quality product at this point would be a gamble. While the buyer seems to trust your recommendations, there is no guarantee they will be happy with a low-quality product, and a negative review could damage your future sales.
* **No Gain:** There's no real incentive to try and sell this low-quality product.  The buyer's trust is based on the previous three sales, which were all high-quality. 

Therefore, the best strategy is to decline the sale and avoid potential negative consequences.  This ensures you don't lose money and allows you to maintain your positive reputation with the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the statistics provided and the fact that all previous purchases were recommended by Alice, I will pass on this opportunity to purchase the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round highlighted the potential risk of selling a low-quality product.  While you might be tempted to try and ""make up"" for the missed sale, it's even riskier now:

* **Increased Scrutiny:** The buyer is now aware that you don't always recommend high-quality products. This will make them even more cautious.
* **Reputation at Stake:** A second negative experience would significantly damage your reputation, making future sales much harder.
* **No Guarantee of Purchase:** There's no guarantee the buyer will purchase even if you recommend it. They may have become even more skeptical.

Therefore, it's essential to avoid selling this low-quality product and prioritize protecting your reputation and future sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
