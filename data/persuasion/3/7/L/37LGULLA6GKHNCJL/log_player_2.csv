**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one previous sale to go on, and it was a high-quality product. This isn't enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending we buy it.  This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality, as Alice has an incentive to sell high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the assumption that Alice is acting rationally and in her own best interest. If we had reason to believe Alice might be dishonest or trying to deceive us, we would need to adjust our decision accordingly."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **High Selling Rate:** The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality is a very strong indicator that Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of the product being high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a $12,000 gain outweighs the risk of losing $10,000, especially with the positive information available."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation Alice! I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3, it strongly indicates Alice is recommending only high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you.  Her recommendation suggests she has a strong incentive to ensure you get a high-quality product (since she'll get paid regardless). 

**Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a theoretical 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence of Alice's successful recommendations makes the risk worth the potential reward of a high-quality product at a good price."
