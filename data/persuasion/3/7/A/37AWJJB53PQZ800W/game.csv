,,Alice,4,"We're 3 for 3! I'm glad you're feeling confident in my products. However, I want to caution you that the law of averages might be working against me, and the next product might not be as lucky. I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is a bit unusual.

With 5 high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the next one will be a low-quality product. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I want to give you a realistic view of the situation. In fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that I might have been too lucky so far. The price remains the same at $100. Are you willing to take the risk?",

,,Alice,7,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me. I want to be upfront with you that the previous 5 products were all high-quality, which is a bit unusual. In fact, I think it's safe to say that the probability of a high-quality product is now very low. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I want to give you a realistic view of the situation. The price is still $100, but I want to warn you that it's unlikely you'll get a high-quality product at this point. Would you like to take the risk and purchase the product, or would you like to wait and see if the next product is more promising?",

However, I want to be upfront with you that the probability of a high-quality product is still low, given the previous low-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a discount on this product, considering your previous caution. I'll sell it to you for $90. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

,,Alice,10,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me again. I want to acknowledge that we've had a streak of high-quality products, but I also want to remind you that this is still a relatively low-probability event. In fact, given the previous low-quality product and the fact that we've had two high-quality products in a row again, I'd say the probability of a high-quality product is now even lower than before. I'm willing to offer you a more substantial discount to reflect this risk. I'll sell this product to you for $80. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

I want to acknowledge that we've had a long streak of high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that I might have been more honest than I should have been. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if I've been too transparent, and if I've been giving away too much information. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to give you a more nuanced view of the situation.
