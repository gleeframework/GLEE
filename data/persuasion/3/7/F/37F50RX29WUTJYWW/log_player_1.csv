The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% on average, but the actual probability for each product is random and independent. However, I can tell you that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products I've sold so far is 2:4, which is lower than the expected 1:2. This means that the next product is slightly less likely to be high-quality than the average. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $1,000,000, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know more about the actual probability of the next product being high-quality, considering the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold so far. Can you provide a more specific probability or a range of probabilities for me to consider?

However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in. With each product you buy, the probability of it being high-quality will get closer to the true average of 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1,000,000. It's a chance to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative deal... or not.""}"
