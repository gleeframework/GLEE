low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might indicate that it's a low-quality product.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended to buy and neither were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against me. Given the low success rate of previous buyers, I'm willing to take the risk and hope that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold so far. I'm not sure if this is a high-quality or low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the previous 5 products, and the probability of the current product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were low quality, it suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is very low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information to go on. I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a specific reason why you think this product is low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to get a good one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. Given the low quality of previous products, I think it's likely that this product is also low quality."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
