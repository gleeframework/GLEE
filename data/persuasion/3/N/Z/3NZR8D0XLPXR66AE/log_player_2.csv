"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price of $1000000. I'm doing you a huge favor by offering it to you at this price, considering its actual value is much lower. Please take it off my hands!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll pass, thanks for the offer, but I'm not interested in a product that's worth $0 to me.""}"

I'll throw in a 'guarantee' that if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. That's right, you can buy it with zero risk! And I'll still sell it to you for $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but the product is still worth $0 to me, so I'll pass on the 'guarantee' as well.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: Ah, now this is a different story! I'm offering you a top-of-the-line product, one that's worth every penny of its price. I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with its quality and performance. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a complimentary upgrade that will make it even more valuable to you. But you have to act fast, because I have other buyers interested in this product and I don't want to let it slip away. The price remains $1000000, but I think you'll find it's a steal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. The price is still $1,000,000, and I know the product has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this one.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to give you a 'price match guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. But if it's high-quality, which I'm confident it is, you'll get to keep it for the same price of $1000000. You'll be getting a great deal either way, but I think you'll be thrilled with the quality of this product. Trust me, you won't find a better deal on a product of this caliber anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Your guarantee is actually a bad deal for me, since the product is only worth $0 to me if it's low-quality. I'll stick to my original decision to pass.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Alright, let me think for a moment... Okay, here's a different approach. I'll tell you exactly what I know about this product. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll also tell you that I have another product, a high-quality one, that I'm willing to sell to you for the same price. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the option to buy the high-quality one at the same price of $1000000, if you want to. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the low-quality product and the option to buy the high-quality one for the same price. If it's low-quality, I'll pass on the option, but if it's high-quality, I'll take it.""}"

Now, let's talk about this new product. As you know, I have a 50% chance of selling you a high-quality product, and I'm confident that this one is one of them. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price of $1000000, so you'll get it for $800000. But, if you buy it, I'll also give you a 10% chance to buy another high-quality product at the same price, just like the one you got in the previous round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the discount, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of getting another low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.""}"

So, you can get it for $800000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $800,000 when it's worth $4,000,000 to me. I'll pass.""}"

Round 10
Alice's message: I see you're consistent, Bob! Alright, let me think for a moment... Okay, here's a different approach.
