,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take it.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not. I'll pass for now.

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance, I need to balance my chances of getting a good product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"She's not recommending it, so I'll pass. Maybe it's low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the chance, I've had two high-quality products in a row, so I'll hope for a third."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row, I'm on a hot streak! I'll keep going."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Four high-quality products in a row is unlikely, I think this one might be low-quality. I'll pass."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I was wrong about the last one, so I'll take the chance again. Five high-quality products in a row is still possible, right?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Five high-quality products in a row is getting ridiculous. I think this one is definitely low-quality. I'll pass.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I was wrong again. I'll just keep taking the chance, maybe I'll get lucky and get a streak going in the other direction."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,Six high-quality products in a row is just too much. I'm starting to think the probability of a low-quality product is higher than I thought. I'll pass.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"She's not recommending it, and I'm starting to think that might be a good sign. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is just absurd. I'm starting to think Alice is trying to trick me. I'll pass.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"She's not recommending it, and I'm starting to think that's a good sign. I'll take the chance, maybe I'll get a low-quality product for once."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm starting to think the probability of a low-quality product is much higher than 20%. I'll pass.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"She's not recommending it, and I'm starting to think she knows something I don't. I'll take the chance, maybe I'll get a low-quality product for once."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is just unbelievable. I'm starting to think I'm in a simulation or something. I'll take the chance, but I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever get a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,Finally! A low-quality product! I'm glad I took the chance on this one. I'll buy it.

,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, so I'm a bit hesitant to spend more money. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've learned my lesson from the last one, but I'll take the chance on this one. Maybe I'll get lucky and get a good deal."
