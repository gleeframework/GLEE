"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to Bob, and the price is fixed at $10,000, it's impossible to know if it's a good deal for him.  However, you are certain this product is high-quality. There's a 50% chance he'll find it valuable enough to buy at that price.  Given the lack of information, recommending a purchase is the best strategy to maximize potential profit."
