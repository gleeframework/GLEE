high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to decline the product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision. Was the product they purchased high-quality?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I'm not getting any useful information from her recommendation. I'm essentially making a random guess."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. If 1 out of 2 buyers purchased the product, and 1 of those was high quality, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the previous sales record, I think the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. With a 50% chance of being high-quality, I don't think the recommendation from Alice is reliable enough to make a purchase decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the third buyer and I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be biased by the fact that she only recommended to the first two buyers, and they both bought the product. I'm hoping that the product is still high-quality and I'll get the $2000000 value. I'm not sure if this is a rational decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the statistics or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there a reason why you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she doesn't know how much the previous products were worth to the buyers. I'm not basing my decision on the quality of the product, but rather on the fact that I'm the last buyer and I don't want the product to be discarded."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I would like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the products offered to all buyers before me, not just the ones sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd appreciate it if you could tell me how many total products have been offered to buyers so far."
