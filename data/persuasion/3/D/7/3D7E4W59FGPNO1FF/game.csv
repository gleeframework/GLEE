high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, which suggests that the products you recommended might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and learn more about the distribution of high-quality products."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products offered might be mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good signal for future buyers."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm a risk-taker!"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be of low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low, and I'd rather wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your past recommendations, but I'm also curious about the product's quality. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and why you're not recommending this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations haven't been successful, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your previous recommendations are not very informative. With 7 purchases and no high-quality products sold, it's possible that the first 7 products were all low-quality. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the first high-quality product. But I'm also aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
