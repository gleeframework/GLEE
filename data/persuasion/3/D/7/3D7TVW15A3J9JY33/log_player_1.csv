Additionally, I'm including a 10-year warranty, which is twice the standard warranty period. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced by the new information. The product is still worth either $0 or $2000000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Instead of a discount, I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' price of $1,200,000, which is a 40% premium over the expected value. However, I'll also give you the option to walk away with a full refund if the expert inspection confirms the product is low-quality. This way, you'll have the best of both worlds: the potential for a high-quality product at a premium price, and the security of being able to walk away without losing anything if it's not up to par.""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in paying a 40% premium over the expected value, even if I do get the option to walk away with a full refund.

This way, you'll have the option to get a high-quality product at the expected value, or walk away with a full refund if it's low-quality. I'll even sweeten the deal by including a complimentary service that adds significant value to the product, which would normally cost $200,000. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a fair price, with added value on top.""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not willing to pay the expected value of $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me. The added value of the complimentary service is nice, but it's not enough to change my decision. I'd like to continue with the inspection and wait for the expert's report.
