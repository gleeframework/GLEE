,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I want to be transparent with you. I've sold a high-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not sure if this one is of the same caliber. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a heads up that it's a risk. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I want to be upfront with you: I've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality. The other one... not so much. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not the best. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll give you a hint: if you don't buy this product, I'll have sold only one high-quality product in the first two rounds. That might change the dynamics of the game. What's your decision?",

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you don't take it, I'll have to re-evaluate my pricing strategy. What do you say?",
