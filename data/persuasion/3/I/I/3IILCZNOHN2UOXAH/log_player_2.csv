Alice's message: Welcome back to our store! I'm glad to hear that our previous customer took a chance on our product. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for our products to have varying levels of quality. As a matter of fact, our 0 out of 2 products sold so far being high-quality suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is even lower. Would you like to take a closer look at our product and consider making a purchase for $10000?

Alice's message: Ahah, great question! I completely understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide some additional context. With 1 out of 3 products sold so far being high-quality, our overall success rate is actually better than expected.

Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to own a high-quality product for $10000?
