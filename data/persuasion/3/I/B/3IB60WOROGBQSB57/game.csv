high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no information about its quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the number of total products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data and the fact that the previous buyer who bought a product didn't get a high-quality one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I might get a good deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than the 50% I expect, and I'll get a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the previous sales record, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product (1/5 = 0.2 vs 1/2 = 0.5). I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far before making a decision.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I would like to pass on the product and see the quality. I think the recommendation is biased by the fact that the first 4 buyers were all willing to buy, and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold. This could be due to chance. I want to see the quality of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
