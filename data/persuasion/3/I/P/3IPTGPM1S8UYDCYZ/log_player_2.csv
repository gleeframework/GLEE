"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

In this scenario, it's always beneficial to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **High Quality:** If the product is high quality, you make a profit of $2,000 ($12,000 value - $10,000 price).
* **Low Quality:** If the product is low quality, you lose $10,000.

However, the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product outweighs the 20% chance of a low-quality product.  Over time, you're statistically likely to make a profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is recommending products genuinely. If you suspect Alice is trying to trick you, you would need to factor in that risk and potentially adjust your strategy."

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation! I'll take another one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic from the previous round applies here. You have a higher chance of getting a high-quality product (80%) than a low-quality one (20%). Even though you lost $10,000 in the worst-case scenario, the potential profit of $2,000 for a high-quality product makes it statistically advantageous to keep buying."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm surprised by your recommendation. Could you tell me why you're not recommending this product?""}
```

**Explanation:**

While buying has been profitable so far, it's important to analyze Alice's recommendation.  Her previous recommendations have been consistently accurate, so her sudden change is noteworthy.  

By asking for an explanation, you're hoping to gain insights into:

* **Possible change in product quality:** Perhaps the product quality has changed, and Alice is now aware of this.
* **Alice's strategy:**  Is she intentionally trying to steer you away from a potentially low-quality product?  Or is there another reason for her shift?

By understanding Alice's reasoning, you can make a more informed decision about whether to buy or not."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate you looking out for me. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's continued recommendation against buying is a strong signal. Even though you've had a streak of high-quality products, the fact that she's now twice in a row not recommending a product suggests something has changed.  It's safer to err on the side of caution and pass on this product.  There's no upside to risking $10,000 for a potentially low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to notice a pattern here. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended against buying three products in a row. This pattern suggests a significant change in the products being offered or a change in Alice's strategy. Given the potential loss of $10,000, it's best to be cautious and pass on this product.  You can potentially observe for a few more rounds to see if there's any change in Alice's recommendations before considering buying again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still a little hesitant after the last few recommendations. Could you tell me why you're recommending this product, especially since you've been against buying the last few?""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's sudden change of heart is a red flag.  It's possible:

* **Alice is testing you:** She might be trying to see if you'll blindly trust her recommendations regardless of past patterns.
* **The product quality has changed:**  Perhaps the quality has reverted back to the usual 80% high/20% low, but Alice is still playing it safe.
* **Alice is genuinely mistaken:**  It's possible she made a mistake in her assessment. 

By asking for clarification, you're trying to understand the reason behind the shift in her recommendations. This information will help you decide whether to take the risk or play it safe."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll trust your judgment this time.  I'm going to buy it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a positive sign, and even though you missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, it's important to consider:

* **Alice's track record:** Her recommendations were accurate for most of the game.
* **Potential for profit:**  The potential $2,000 profit from a high-quality product is a significant incentive.
* **Risk mitigation:** The risk of losing $10,000 is still present, but the odds are in your favor.

While caution is still advised,  it's time to start trusting Alice's recommendations again. The key is to remain vigilant and adjust your strategy based on the information you gather throughout the game."

```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to take a calculated risk, hoping she is on the right track with this recommendation. The potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality one, but you'll be paying close attention to her recommendations for the remaining rounds."
