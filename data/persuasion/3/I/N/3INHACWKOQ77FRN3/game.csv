,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your analytical approach. You're right, the odds are important to consider, and I'm willing to give you more information to help you make a decision. Let me put it this way: if you were to buy 10 of these products, you'd expect to get around 8 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. That's the probability we're working with.

This next product is another high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the results. However, I want to remind you that the odds are still in your favor, but they're not as high as they were in the previous round.
