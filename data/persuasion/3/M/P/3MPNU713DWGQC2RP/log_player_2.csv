Round 2

Round 3
Alice's message: I know you passed on the last one, and I don't blame you. But I want to make it clear that this product is not like the last one. It's actually a very unique opportunity to get a product at a price that's significantly lower than its market value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm only doing it because I want to clear out some inventory. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be your chance to get it.

I'm not offering any special deals or discounts, but I am willing to throw in a 10% discount if you're willing to commit to buying a second product from me in the next 2 rounds. That would bring the price down to $90. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's message: No pressure, Bob. I just wanted to give you a fair warning that this product is a real showstopper. It's one of the best in its class, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep it in stock. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll even throw in a small gift with your purchase - a $10 gift card to a related service. It's a great value, and I think you'll really appreciate it.

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase if you buy this one. It's a way to get a good deal on a product that's still functional, and you can always consider the discount on a future purchase.

I'm just going to be honest and say that it's not worth the $100. But I'll let you have it for $80. That's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and it's a deal that's only available to you because I'm trying to clear out this inventory.
