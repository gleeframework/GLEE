Since I've sold 10, it's still less than expected. However, I can provide you with the exact calculation behind the probability. Using Bayes' theorem, I calculated the probability of the current product being high-quality as follows: P(high-quality) = (number of high-quality products sold so far / total products sold so far) / (number of high-quality products sold so far / total products sold so far + (1 - probability of high-quality) * (1 - number of high-quality products sold so far / total products sold so far)) = (10/15) / (10/15 + 0.2 * (5/15)) = 0.93.
