Alice's message: I appreciate your understanding, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bit of a rut. I've sold you 8 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not getting any concessions from you. I'm going to try a different approach. I'll sell you this next product at the full price of $10000, but I'll also throw in a unique experience: I'll give you a behind-the-scenes tour of my operation, showing you how I source and curate my high-quality products. It's a $2000 value, absolutely free. You'll get to see the inner workings of my business and learn more about what makes my products special.

Round 17
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the tour, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. It's not one of my best offerings, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'll sell it to you for $2000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with it, but I think it's a good value for the price. And, as a bonus, I'll throw in a complimentary product that's actually pretty decent. It's not a high-quality product, but it's not bad either. You can use it as a consolation prize, I suppose.
