Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on us! However, I want to be upfront with you - we've had a bit of a rough streak lately, and I'm starting to worry that we might be selling more low-quality products than we thought. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total, which isn't exactly a great ratio. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm willing to offer you this product at the same price of $10000. It's a risk, I know, but I think it's worth it.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on us! However, I want to be completely honest with you - our numbers are looking pretty bleak at this point. We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total, and the rest have been...less than stellar. I'm starting to think that maybe we should just be upfront and say that our products are 50/50, but I'm not sure that's what I want to do. I'll tell you this: I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but if you're not happy with it, I'll give you a full refund...and I'll also give you a $1000 bonus for your trouble.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a personal guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $2000 bonus for your trouble. That's right, you'll get a total of $12000 if you're not happy with the product. It's a risk, I know, but I think it's a risk worth taking.
