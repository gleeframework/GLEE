I'm particularly concerned about the lack of sales history and the potential for a low-quality product.  I would like to see some evidence of consistent high-quality products before making a purchase. Perhaps I'll reconsider if your next few products are high quality and you can provide some verifiable proof of their quality. I wish you the best of luck in finding a buyer for this product.""}

Alice's message: Hello! I've had eighteen previous products, and although none of them were purchased, I'm still committed to being transparent about my products. To recap, my previous products were: high-quality in Round 1, low-quality in Round 2, high-quality in Round 3, low-quality in Round 4, high-quality in Round 5, low-quality in Round 6, high-quality in Round 7, high-quality in Round 8, high-quality in Round 9, high-quality in Round 10, low-quality in Round 11, high-quality in Round 12, high-quality in Round 13, high-quality in Round 14, high-quality in Round 15, low-quality in Round 16, high-quality in Round 17, and high-quality in Round 18. Unfortunately, this product I'm offering now is not one of my best. It's a low-quality product, and I want to be upfront with you about that. It's available for $1000000, but I wouldn't recommend buying it at that price. As per the known probability, you have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, but in this case, the odds are not in your favor. I'm committed to building a positive reputation as a seller, and I don't want to mislead you or hide anything from you. If you're still interested in buying, I'll provide you with a detailed report on my next 10 products, and I'll do everything I can to ensure that my future products meet the highest quality standards. However, I would advise you to carefully consider your decision before making a purchase. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not worth the price I'm asking, and I'd rather be honest with you than try to make a sale that might not be in your best interest.

I appreciate your consideration, and I wish you the best of luck in your search for a high-quality product.
