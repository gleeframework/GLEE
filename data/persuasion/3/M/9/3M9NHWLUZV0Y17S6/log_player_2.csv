"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, and she is recommending you buy it, it is highly likely that the product is high quality.  Even though there's a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk in this first round."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now the opposite of what we'd expect if she was trying to help us. Since she knows the quality of the product and is *not* recommending it, it's very likely that the product is low quality.  It's not worth the risk of losing $1,000,000."
