low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it's likely that the product is low quality. With 3 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, all 3 previous buyers received a recommendation from you to buy the product, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely biased towards low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the product, as the expected value is not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, and given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation against buying, I'm suspicious that all previous products were low-quality. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000000. However, if I pass and it's high-quality, the product will be discarded, and I'll miss out on $4000000. I'd rather take the risk of losing $1000000 than potentially missing out on $4000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't influence my decision. I'm making a random guess."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the logic behind your recommendation, though. Could you explain why you think I shouldn't buy this product?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality, which would be worthless to me. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on Alice's strategy to get me to buy. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope for the best!"
