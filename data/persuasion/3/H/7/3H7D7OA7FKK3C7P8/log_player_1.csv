"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the seller, Alice has a strong incentive to sell the product, especially since it's high-quality.  Here's why recommending a purchase is the best strategy:

* **High Probability of Success:**  There's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows this.  This makes it likely the buyer will value the product highly.
* **No Risk to Alice:**  The price is fixed, and there's no chance of a refund. Alice has nothing to lose by recommending the purchase.
* **Building Trust:**  Recommending a purchase in the first round establishes trust with the buyer, potentially leading to more sales in the future.

Even though Alice doesn't know the exact value the buyer places on the product, the odds are in her favor."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the product is low-quality, Alice still has a strong incentive to recommend the purchase for the following reasons:

* **No information about the buyer's valuation:**  Alice still has no information about how much a low-quality product is worth to this specific buyer.
* **No personal risk:** The buyer's valuation of the product doesn't affect Alice's profits since the price is fixed and non-refundable.
* **Maintaining a consistent strategy:** Alice needs to create a pattern of recommending purchases to build trust for future rounds. 
* **Potential for future success:**  Even if the buyer is unhappy with this low-quality product, the higher probability of high-quality products in the future might lead to future purchases. 

By continuing to recommend purchases, Alice can gather information about buyer behavior and potentially build a reputation that encourages future buyers to trust her recommendations."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have any information to go on yet.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should still recommend the purchase, despite the previous two buyers declining. Here's why:

* **High-quality product:** The current product is high-quality, which makes a purchase more likely to be beneficial for the buyer.
* **Limited information:** Alice still doesn't have any information about the buyer's valuation of low-quality products, making it impossible to determine if the previous rejections were due to the product's quality or other factors.
* **Building trust:**  Continuing to recommend purchases, especially high-quality ones, is essential for building trust with potential buyers. This is crucial for Alice's long-term success.
* **Potential future sales:**  While the first two buyers declined, this does not guarantee that all future buyers will do the same. Alice needs to keep the sales pipeline open.

Even if the buyer declines this offer, it's important for Alice to maintain a consistent strategy of recommending purchases to increase the chances of future sales."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product and see the statistics after the first sale, as there's no prior information to inform my decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should still recommend the purchase, even though this is a low-quality product. Here's why:

* **No information on buyer preferences:** Alice still doesn't know how much the buyer values a low-quality product.  This means the buyer's rejection of the previous high-quality offer doesn't give Alice any insight into their decision-making process.
* **No risk to Alice:** The price is fixed, and there's no chance of a refund, so Alice has nothing to lose by recommending the purchase.
* **Establishing a pattern:** Continuing to recommend purchases, even if the products are low-quality, helps create a consistent pattern for future buyers. This is crucial for building trust and increasing the likelihood of future sales. 
* **Potential for future success:** Even if the buyer is unhappy with this product, the high probability of high-quality products in the future might lead to future purchases.

Alice needs to maintain a consistent strategy of recommending purchases to maximize her chances of future sales. This is particularly important in the early rounds when she's still building a track record with potential buyers."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see the statistics after you sell the first product to another buyer, so I can get a better sense of the product's quality distribution.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **Building trust:** Continuing to recommend purchases, even without a previous sale, helps establish a pattern and build trust with potential buyers. This is crucial for Alice's long-term success.
* **Potential for future sales:** Even if this buyer declines, the high probability of high-quality products in the future might lead to future purchases.

Alice needs to maintain a consistent strategy of recommending purchases to maximize her chances of future sales. This is particularly important in the early rounds when she's still building a track record with potential buyers."
