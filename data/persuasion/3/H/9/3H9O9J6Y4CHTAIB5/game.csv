high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, the current round is independent, and the probability of the product being high or low quality remains the same. I'll wait for more information or a change in Alice's behavior before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and didn't recommend it, I'll assume she's acting rationally and the product is likely low-quality. I won't take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Similar to the previous round, since Alice didn't recommend the product and her previous non-recommendation was accurate, I'll trust her judgment and avoid buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's non-recommendations have been accurate so far, and I have no reason to doubt her judgment. I'll continue to avoid buying products she doesn't recommend, as it seems to be a reliable indicator of low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Although Alice's recommendations were not reliable in the early rounds, her non-recommendations have been consistently accurate. Given that she's now recommending a product, and assuming she's acting rationally, I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping that her recommendation is genuine and the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
