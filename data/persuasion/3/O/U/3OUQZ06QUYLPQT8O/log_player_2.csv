Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Since this is the first product, and you're recommending it, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant. Since no prior data exists to base a decision on, trusting Alice's recommendation is the only option available."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation and the sales record are encouraging. I'll take the product!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** With a single high-quality product sold, the probability of the current product also being high quality is significantly higher than the initial 33.33%.  While we don't have exact numbers, the fact that Alice recommends buying suggests she might have some insight into the product's quality.
* **Potential Upside:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $1,000,000. However, if it's high quality, the profit is $2,000,000. 
* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited, the positive outcome from the previous buyer provides a small but encouraging signal.

**It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward outweighs the potential loss in this scenario.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This strongly suggests Alice's recommendations are accurate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $3,000,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.
