,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $1250000, for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a deal like this again. If you buy it, you'll be getting a 20% discount.

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first purchase! However, I want to inform you that this next product is actually a low-quality item, which is worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for $50000, which is a significant discount from its actual value of $0. I'm willing to let you have it for this low price because I'm looking to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. It's a great opportunity to get something for free, essentially. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm not interested in purchasing this product. I prefer to focus on acquiring high-quality items that provide value to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your preference for high-quality items, Bob. However, I want to make you an offer that might change your mind. I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $10000. Yes, you heard that right, just $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to you. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm doing it because I value our relationship and want to keep you as a customer. If you buy this product, I'll also throw in a special offer for the next product: I'll give you a 20% discount on it, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",

But here's the catch: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance to buy the next product at the original price of $1250000, even if it's a low-quality item. That's right, you could get a $1.25 million product for just $5000. It's a risk, but it's also a potential game-changer. What do you say?",
