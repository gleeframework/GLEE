low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and the lack of high-quality sales suggests that the current product might be low-quality. However, I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on the lack of sales of high-quality products so far, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product. I'm aware that the previous two buyers didn't buy based on Alice's recommendations, which might indicate that the products they saw were low-quality. I'm hoping that this one might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests that the products Alice is selling might be of low quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'm hoping the next product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product or more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that this product is also low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be out $10000. If I pass and it's high quality, it will be discarded, and the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,18,yes,
