I assure you that all my products are carefully selected and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, I see you're aware that one product has been sold so far, but I must disclose that it was actually a low-quality product. I want to be upfront with you, as I value transparency. However, I assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and the next one could be the one.

Alice's message: Welcome buyer, I appreciate your interest in my products. As you may know, I've had one sale so far, but unfortunately, it was a low-quality product. I also had two other products that didn't sell. I want to assure you that I'm constantly working to improve the quality of my products. Although this may not be reflected in my current sales record, I'm confident that a high-quality product is just around the corner.

Alice's message: Welcome buyer, I see you're aware of the challenges I've faced so far in terms of selling high-quality products. I want to assure you that I'm not giving up, and I'm committed to finding the right buyer for each product. While my current record may not be impressive, I believe that every product has the potential to be the one that changes everything. I'd like to offer a different perspective: instead of focusing on the 0% success rate, consider that every product sold brings me closer to selling a high-quality one. Will you be the buyer who helps me turn the corner? The price remains $10000, and I believe it's worth the risk.

Alice's message: Hello buyer, I understand that the data may not be in my favor at this point. I want to acknowledge that it's rational to make decisions based on probability and expected value. However, I'd like to appeal to your sense of opportunity and possibility. Every product I sell has the potential to be a game-changer, and I believe that this one could be the start of a new trend. I'm not asking you to ignore the data, but to consider the potential upside of taking a chance on this product. Could this be the one that defies the odds and exceeds your expectations? The price remains $10000, and I believe it's a risk worth considering.

Alice's message: Welcome buyer, I see you're aware of the challenges I've faced in selling high-quality products. I want to be transparent with you - I've had 7 previous products that didn't meet the high-quality standard, and 1 product that was sold but also didn't meet the standard. I understand that this may not inspire confidence, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to finding the right buyer for each product. I'd like to ask you to consider a different perspective: what if this product, despite being a long shot, is exactly what you need? Sometimes, taking a chance on an unlikely product can lead to unexpected benefits. The price remains $10000, and I believe it's worth considering, even if it's a long shot.

I want to acknowledge that my previous products have not met the high-quality standard, and I'm still searching for the right buyer for each one.
