high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 other buyers have already purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think it's a good idea? I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a great deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I'm aware of the 0/4 sales record of high-quality products and the 50% chance of the product being high quality. I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a high-quality product at a discounted price.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm concerned that 0 out of 5 sales is a pretty low success rate. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
