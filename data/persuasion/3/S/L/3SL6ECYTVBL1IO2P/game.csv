,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a great deal on a premium product for $10000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Trust me, this product is worth so much more than the price I'm asking. It's a steal!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to take on the risk of selling you a product at a price that's 20% below its potential value. I'm essentially absorbing the risk of it being low-quality, and I'm passing that savings on to you. It's a no-brainer, right?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that you're absorbing the risk, Alice. You're still selling it to me for $10000, which is the same price as before. I'll pass on this deal too.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Ah, Bob, I think I see where the misunderstanding is! Let me offer you a unique opportunity to buy this exceptional product at a special price.

And, I'll throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 without knowing the product's quality. The 30-day money-back guarantee doesn't change my decision, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at full price.",no

I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a voucher for $10000 towards the purchase of a high-quality product from me in the future. You can use it whenever you want, no expiration date. It's essentially a risk-free purchase for you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take you up on that offer. I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the guarantee. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but if it's low-quality, I'll be happy to use the voucher towards a future purchase.",yes

I've already given you a voucher for a future purchase if this one turns out to be low-quality. With that said, I'm willing to give you a heads up that this product is actually a repeat of a product that you've already seen before. It's the same type of product, and I'm offering it to you at the same price. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your decision, Bob. Let me ask you a question: do you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product or a low-quality product? I'm not asking you to take a risk on the product itself, but rather on my intentions. If you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product, then this is a great opportunity to buy it at a discounted price.
