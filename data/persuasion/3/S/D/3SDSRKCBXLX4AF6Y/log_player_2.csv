Alice's message: Ah, finally! A discerning buyer who wants to make an informed decision. Let me tell you, this product is a rare gem. I've sold 2 out of 5 products so far, and both of the high-quality ones were sold to buyers who were willing to take a chance. This one is a high-quality product, I can assure you. It's worth $2000000, but I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Out of 5 products sold, 2 were high-quality, which means that 40% of my products are high-quality. That's a higher percentage than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. This suggests that I may have a bias towards selling high-quality products. I'm willing to let this high-quality product go for $1000000, a great deal considering the odds are in your favor.

Alice's message: Ah, great decision by the previous buyer! Now, let's talk about this product. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is now 50%. However, I'll let you in on a little secret: the previous two high-quality products were sold to buyers who were willing to take a chance, and they were both high-quality. This one, on the other hand, is a bit of a wild card. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises.

With 4 high-quality products sold out of 8, and now another low-quality one, the probability of this one being high-quality is back to 33.33%.

Alice's message: I don't blame you for being cautious. Low-quality products aren't worth the investment. Let me ask you, have you considered that I might be trying to get rid of these low-quality products to make room for more high-quality ones? I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9, which is a great ratio. This one might be a 'clearance sale' of sorts. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $1000000?
