Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if it's actually high-quality, and even if it is, I'd have to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a 20% chance of being a bad deal. I'll pass for now.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, Alice, but I'm still not convinced.
