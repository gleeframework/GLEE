high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely to be offered to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products sold were high quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is more indicative of the product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 50%. This suggests that the remaining products may have a higher likelihood of being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or consider buying a product that has been previously recommended by Alice."
