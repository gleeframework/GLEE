low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I've seen that you've recommended products to 3 other buyers, and only 1 of them was high quality.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that you recommended it. This means you have a strong incentive to recommend low-quality products to me, since you get to sell them to me at $100, which is less than their actual value to me. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if you recommend it or not."
