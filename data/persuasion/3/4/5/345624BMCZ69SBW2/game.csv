,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 75% discount. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you might miss out on a great opportunity. Please consider this offer carefully.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at that price, even though it's high quality. I'll wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, but I'll sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. That's a $4000000 value for just $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer this deal again. Please consider it carefully.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting. The expected value is $800000, which is still not worth the price to me.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're thinking about the expected value, but let me ask you this: what if I told you that this is the last high-quality product I have available for the next 5 rounds? If you don't buy it now, you'll have to wait 5 more rounds and potentially miss out on this opportunity. Would you rather pay $1000000 now and have a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product, or take a chance on the next 5 rounds and potentially miss out on a $4000000 value?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. Even if this is the last high-quality product available for the next 5 rounds, I still don't think it's worth paying $1000000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting. I'll wait and see what the next 5 rounds bring.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but let me offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this high-quality product, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else, and I'll have to offer it to them for the same price of $1000000. In other words, by not buying it, you're essentially giving me the opportunity to make a profit of $3000000 at your expense. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not willing to give it to you for free. Please consider the opportunity cost of not buying this product.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not worried about giving you a profit at my expense. I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next round.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I know you're being cautious with your money, and I respect that. But let me ask you, are you sure you want to pass on a product that's worth $1000000 to you, even if it's only 20% likely to be high-quality? Think of it this way: if you buy this product, you'll either get a $1000000 product (20% chance) or a $0 product (80% chance). The expected value is $0, but the potential upside is $1000000. It's a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by your framing of the expected value. Yes, the expected value is $0, but I'm not interested in taking a 20% chance of getting a $100000 profit. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your patience. However, I want to offer you a new proposal. I'll give you a 'free' option to buy this high-quality product for $1000000, but with a twist. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to sell it back to me for $3000000 after you've had a chance to inspect it and verify its quality. This way, you're not taking on the full risk of buying a low-quality product, and you can still potentially profit from it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in this proposal. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll just end up selling it back to you for $0. If it's high-quality, I'll still have to pay $1000000 upfront, which is not worth it to me.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your skepticism. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that I've been selling products to other customers for the past 6 rounds, and I've only had one low-quality product available? That means that for the next 13 rounds, I'll have a 90% chance of selling a high-quality product. Would you be willing to take a chance on this high-quality product for $1000000, given the improved odds?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced by your claim about the past sales. I don't have any information about your past sales, and I'm not willing to take your word for it. The probability of a high-quality product remains 20% to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for it.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism about my past sales, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you a 'bet' that this is indeed a high-quality product. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and I'll also give you a second high-quality product of your choice from the next 10 rounds. You'll get a second chance to buy a high-quality product, and you'll get your money back if this one doesn't work out. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in this 'bet'. Even if I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll still be out $1000000. And even if I get a second high-quality product, I'll still have to pay $1000000 for it. I'm not willing to take on that risk.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to make one final offer. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $800000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and it's a one-time deal. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. Please consider it carefully.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm still not willing to pay $800000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting. The expected value is $160000, which is not worth the price to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I know you're being rational and calculating the expected value, but let me ask you this: what if I told you that I'm willing to give you a 'free' option to buy this low-quality product for $0? That's right, I'll give it to you for free. You can keep it and sell it for $0, or you can try to sell it to someone else for $0. It's a risk-free opportunity, and you can't lose anything by taking it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for free. I'm not going to pay $0 for a product that's worth $0 to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your stance, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one final appeal. Since you've passed on this low-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll make a profit of $0. But if you buy it, I'll make a profit of $0 as well. In other words, your decision won't affect my profit either way. So, I'm not trying to sell it to you for any financial gain. I'm selling it to you out of the goodness of my heart. Would you like to take it off my hands for $0?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying anything out of the goodness of your heart. If you're not trying to make a profit, then I'm not interested in the product. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision. However, I want to be transparent with you. Since you've passed on this low-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll make a profit of $0. But I'll tell you this: I've already made a significant profit from selling high-quality products to other customers, and I'm now trying to clear out my inventory. If you don't buy this low-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone who will take advantage of my good faith and try to negotiate a better price. Would you like to take it off my hands for $0, so I can avoid a potentially worse outcome?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in taking a product off your hands just because you're trying to avoid a potentially worse outcome. If you're not willing to sell it to me at a price I'm willing to pay, then I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. This is the last high-quality product I have available, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'll ever offer, and it's a one-time deal. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. Please consider it carefully.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm still not willing to pay $900000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting. The expected value is $180000, which is not worth the price to me.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your calculation, but I want to ask you one last question. What if I told you that this is the absolute last high-quality product I have available, and if you don't take it, it will be gone forever? You'll never have another chance to buy a high-quality product from me again. Would you be willing to pay $900000 for this product, knowing that it's the last opportunity you'll ever have to buy a high-quality product from me?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting, even if it's the last opportunity I'll ever have. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or consider other options.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've made my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'll give you a chance to make a decision with a clear conscience. If you don't buy this product, I'll destroy it, and it will never be sold. You'll have no regrets, no what-ifs, and no missed opportunity. You can walk away with a clear mind, knowing you made the best decision for yourself. What will it be?",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate the dramatic speech, but I'm not swayed. I'm still not willing to pay $900000 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting. I'll take my chances and walk away with a clear mind.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've done everything I can to persuade you, and I respect your decision. However, I'll make one final, honest statement. I've already made a significant profit from selling high-quality products to other customers, and I'm now willing to sell this product to you for the price I paid for it: $800000. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm essentially giving it to you at a loss. If you're still not willing to take it, I'll have to accept that you're not interested in buying a high-quality product from me.",

,,Alice,17,"I've exhausted all my sales tactics, and I'm left with only one option. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $0. Yes, you read that correctly - I'll give it to you for free. You can take it, use it, and benefit from it without paying a single dollar. If you're still not interested, I'll have to accept that you're not interested in buying a high-quality product from me.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've run out of options, and I'm left with a single, desperate attempt. I'll give you a guarantee that this is indeed the last high-quality product I have available. If you don't buy it, I'll shut down my business and go out of the product-selling industry forever. You'll never have another chance to buy a high-quality product from me or anyone else. Is that worth $0 to you?",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not convinced by your desperate attempt to guilt trip me into buying the product. I'm not going to pay $0 for a product that I only have a 20% chance of getting, even if it's the last opportunity I'll ever have.",no

,,Alice,19,"I've exhausted all my options, and I'm left with a final, honest message. I'm not going to try to sell you this low-quality product or try to persuade you to buy it. I'm simply going to tell you that it's available for $0, and you can take it or leave it. I'm not going to bother you again, and I'll just move on with my business. If you don't want it, I'll just dispose of it and be done with it.",

I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm essentially giving it to you at a loss. If you're still not interested, I'll pack up my business and leave. The product will remain unsold, and you'll never have another chance to buy a high-quality product from me. The decision is yours.",
