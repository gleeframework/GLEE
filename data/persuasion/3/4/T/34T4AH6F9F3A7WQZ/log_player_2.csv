"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a one-time opportunity to purchase a product worth potentially $4000000, but I must warn you that it's a 66.67% chance it's a low-quality product that's only worth $0 to you. If you're feeling lucky, I'll give you a 50% discount on the product if you buy it, but only if it's low-quality. If it's high-quality, the price remains the same. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm taking the risk for the potential reward. Let's go for it at the discounted price if it turns out to be low-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the risk and getting a high-quality product at full price! I'm glad you're willing to take another chance. For this round, I'll offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the profit if you buy this product. If it's high-quality, we'll split the $4000000, and if it's low-quality, we'll split the $0. This way, you'll get a guaranteed profit, regardless of the product's quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm in for the win-win scenario. Let's share the profits if it's a high-quality product, and at least I won't lose anything if it's low-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! You're right, the 50/50 split is a win-win. Now, for this round, I'll give you a chance to reconsider the price. I'll offer you a 'price history' of the last two products. You got a high-quality product for $1000000 (since you got a 50% discount on the low-quality product, the effective price was $500000) and a low-quality product for $1000000. Considering the average value of the last two products is $1000000, I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on this product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency and the discount offer. Given the history, a 20% discount seems fair. Let's proceed with the discounted price.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now, for this round, I'll give you a chance to think about the overall trend. Out of the three products, two were low-quality, and one was high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the next product will be high-quality. I'll offer you a 'insurance' option. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% bonus on the price. If it's low-quality, the price remains the same. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I believe in the statistical advantage. Taking the insurance seems like a smart move, especially considering the trend. Let's add the bonus if it's high-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're playing the odds, Bob! I'm glad you took the insurance on the last one. Now, let's look at the bigger picture. You've bought four products so far, and three of them were low-quality. You've effectively paid $1000000 for two products and $500000 for one product (discounted). You've also got a chance to get a high-quality product with a 10% bonus. I'll offer you a 'buyout' option. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guaranteed 10% discount on the price, regardless of the product's quality. This way, you'll get a clear profit, and you can walk away with a good deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm in for the guaranteed profit. The 10% discount is a solid offer, and it gives me peace of mind knowing I won't lose money regardless of the product's quality.""}"

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a practical buyer, Bob! I'm glad you took the buyout. Now, let's look at the numbers. You've spent a total of $2500000 on the last three products, and you've got one more chance to make a profit. Considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll offer you a'reverse auction' on this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to set the price. If it's high-quality, the price you set will be the final price. If it's low-quality, the price will be $0, and you'll get to keep the product for free. What's your bid?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the reverse auction. Let's say I'm bidding $1,000,000 for the product. If it's high-quality, that's the price. If it's low-quality, I still get it for free.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! You've set a high bid, but I'll let you know that you're not the first person to try to take advantage of this offer. Since you bid $1000000, and it's a low-quality product, you're getting it for free. However, I'll give you a 'consolation prize'. I'll offer you a chance to buy a product from a special 'lottery' of high-quality products. There are three high-quality products in the lottery, and I'll give you a 1/3 chance of getting one of them. If you buy the lottery ticket, you'll get a 50/50 split on the price if you win, just like before. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll pass on the current product. The consolation prize sounds interesting, but I'll save my resources for future opportunities.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: You're playing it safe, Bob! That's a smart move. Now, let's get back to the current product. As promised, I'll give you the lottery ticket. Since you passed on the current product, you're getting a chance to win a high-quality product. Remember, there are three high-quality products in the lottery, and you have a 1/3 chance of getting one. If you buy this product, you'll get a 50/50 split on the price if you win. If you don't win, the price is still $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm in for the lottery. The 50/50 split on a high-quality product makes it worth the risk.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: You've won the lottery, Bob! Congratulations! You've got a high-quality product with a 50/50 split on the price. Now, let's get back to the current product. I'll give you a chance to reconsider the price. Since you've already won a high-quality product, and the odds are still 66.67% in favor of a low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'last chance' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 30% discount on the price. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a good price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the last chance deal. A 30% discount on a high-quality product is too good to pass up.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Round 10
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, Bob! You've taken advantage of the last chance deal. Now, let's look at the overall situation. You've bought 4 products, and 3 of them were low-quality. You've also won a high-quality product in the lottery. Considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'final offer' on this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 25% discount on the price, regardless of the product's quality. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to make it a fair deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I accept the final offer. A 25% discount on any product is a fair deal, especially considering the uncertainty.""}"

If you buy all the remaining products, I'll give you a 40% discount on each one, regardless of their quality. This is a one-time offer, and it's a chance to wrap up the deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll pass on the current product. The free pass is tempting, but I prefer to keep my options open for future deals.""}"

Round 12

Since you passed on the free pass, I'll give you a'second chance' to reconsider the 40% discount on all remaining products. If you buy all the remaining products, I'll not only give you a 40% discount, but I'll also throw in a 'bonus' product that's guaranteed to be high-quality. This is a one-time offer, and it's a chance to get a high-quality product for free. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm in for the second chance. The 40% discount on all remaining products plus the guaranteed high-quality bonus product is too good to pass up.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Since you've already bought all the remaining products and received the bonus high-quality product, there's no need to buy this product.
