low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's information, not mine. I'll wait for the outcome of the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far to make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 buyer and 1 product sold, and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm not confident in the recommendation. Can I get more information about the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's likely that the previous buyer was also recommended to buy and passed, which would mean the product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, which suggests it might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the previous buyer's purchase. If she's recommending based on the statistics, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm curious to see if it's high quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%, but the lack of previous sales suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold yet, and the recommendation is based on Alice's incomplete information."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a $0 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the 4th buyer and there's still a 20% chance it could be high quality, which is worth $300 to me. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy the product, but none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, it suggests that all of them received low-quality products. This would mean that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than 80%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products is higher."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality. The probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%. Given the current information, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I would like to pass on it."
