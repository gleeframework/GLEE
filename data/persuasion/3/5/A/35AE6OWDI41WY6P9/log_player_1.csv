The second buyer was cautious and didn't buy. Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I've already sold one high-quality product to another buyer. This increases the likelihood that the current product is high-quality. Plus, the odds are still 50% that the product is high-quality, so it's a fair deal.""

This suggests that the bias might be against selling high-quality products to those who don't buy. The fact that I'm offering a high-quality product to you now, after selling two high-quality products to other buyers, suggests that I'm actually trying to sell high-quality products to those who are willing to buy.
