,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $1000000 without more information or a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and there's already a high chance (66.67%) of it being low quality, it's even more likely now that the product is not worth the investment. I'll pass on this one too."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I notice that Alice didn't recommend the product in the last two rounds, but both products turned out to be high-quality. This makes me suspect that Alice might be trying to trick me into not buying high-quality products. Given the fixed price and the potential value of a high-quality product, I'll take the risk this time and buy it, despite Alice's recommendation to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I took a risk in the previous round and it didn't pay off.

The odds of it being low-quality are still high, and I don't want to lose another $1000000."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's recommendation has been consistent, and in the last round, the product was indeed low-quality. I'll continue to trust that her recommendation is informative and avoid buying a product she doesn't recommend. The potential loss of $1000000 is too great to take the risk again."
