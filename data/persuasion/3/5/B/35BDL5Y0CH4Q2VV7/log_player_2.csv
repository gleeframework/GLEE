Since I don't have any additional information about the product's quality beyond Alice's recommendation and the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality, I will make a decision based on this limited information.

Given that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and Alice's recommendation might (or might not) be based on some insider knowledge, I'll take a chance.
