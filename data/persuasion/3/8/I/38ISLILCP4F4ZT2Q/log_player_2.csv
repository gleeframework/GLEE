Alice's message: You are correct that the sales record suggests a higher proportion of high-quality products, but the probability remains the same because the previous sales were independent events. Each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, regardless of the previous sales. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, and I'm willing to provide a detailed explanation of the probability and statistics behind my sales record. I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold will converge to the true probability as the number of sales increases. Since I've sold 5 products so far, the observed proportion of high-quality products (60%) is likely to be a result of chance, and the true probability remains 50%.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information about my inspection process.
