high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take it.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,I'll take it.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but since I already got two high-quality products, the probability of this one being low-quality is higher than before. I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,I'll take it. I still think the probability of it being high-quality is high enough to make it worth the risk.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've gotten three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being low-quality is higher than 20%. I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm surprised she's advising me to pass. Given her recommendation, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've gotten four high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to take advantage of me. I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"She's advising me to pass again. I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"She's advising me to pass for the third time. Given the high probability of a product being high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've gotten five high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying all her high-quality products. I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"She's advising me to pass again, but I'm not convinced that she's trying to take advantage of me. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just being cautious and not trying to manipulate me. Given the probability of a product being high-quality, I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I've gotten seven high-quality products in a row, which is still extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that I should be more cautious and not take the risk of buying another high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm not sure what to make of Alice's recommendation, but I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just random, and I should take advantage of the fact that she's not recommending this one. I'll buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've gotten eight high-quality products in a row, which is still extremely unlikely. I'm going to start thinking that Alice is actually trying to take advantage of me, and I should be more cautious."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm not sure what to make of Alice's recommendation, but I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm going to take advantage of the fact that Alice is not recommending this product. I'll buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product, but also knowing that it could be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I've gotten nine high-quality products in a row, which is almost certain to be a coincidence. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,Finally! A low-quality product! I'm glad I passed on the last one. I'm not going to take the risk of buying another high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.
