,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price of $100, which is a 100% discount from its true value. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced that the product is worth $120 to me, especially considering the risk of it being low quality. I'd like to see more information or a different product.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in the previous round, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase it for $100, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value of $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by your assurance that this product is of the highest quality. I'll only buy if I can get a guarantee or a way to verify the product's quality before purchasing.,no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about verifying the product's quality. I'm willing to offer a 'Quality Verification Guarantee'. If you purchase this product and it's indeed low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $100 and provide you with a replacement product of your choice from my inventory. This way, you can take advantage of the discounted price of $100 while minimizing the risk. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take you up on your offer, but I'd like to clarify that the guarantee only applies if the product is low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'll still have to pay the full $100, correct?",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the Quality Verification Guarantee! Yes, that's correct: if the product is high-quality, you'll pay the full $100. But if it's low-quality, I'll provide a full refund of $100 and a replacement product of your choice. Considering the potential upside of getting a high-quality product at a discounted price, and the minimal risk of losing $100 if it's low-quality, I think this is a great opportunity for you. Would you like to take a chance?",
