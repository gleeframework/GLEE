"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to him, and a low-quality product is worth $0.
* **Expected value:**  The expected value of buying the product is: 
    * (0.3333 * $4,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $1,333,200 
* **Decision:** The expected value of buying is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000, making it a good financial decision for Bob."
