  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the first product was likely low-quality. If I buy this product and it's also low-quality, it would reinforce the idea that the first product was low-quality, which might lead Alice to give future buyers incorrect recommendations. By passing on this product, I'm trying to avoid influencing Alice's future recommendations and potentially getting a low-quality product.""
