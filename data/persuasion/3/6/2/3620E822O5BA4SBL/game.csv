,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not binding and I'll make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the first product was likely low-quality. If I buy this product and it's also low-quality, it would reinforce the idea that the first product was low-quality, which might lead Alice to give future buyers incorrect recommendations. By passing on this product, I'm trying to avoid influencing Alice's future recommendations and potentially getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended it. If it were high quality, it's likely she would have recommended it to the first buyer, but since it was low quality, she is recommending it to me. This suggests that the first buyer was likely a high-quality product, and I should be cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for more data."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll lose $1000000. If I pass and it's low-quality, the product will be discarded, and no one will be able to buy it. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."

,,Alice,15,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll take a risk-averse approach and pass on the product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
