,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality."

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take the chance and see if I get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me what led you to not recommend it to me? Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. If 1 high-quality product was sold out of 5, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/5. However, I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% regardless of the previous sales record. I'm hoping that the previous sales record is representative of the overall population, but I'm not sure. I'm taking a risk here."
