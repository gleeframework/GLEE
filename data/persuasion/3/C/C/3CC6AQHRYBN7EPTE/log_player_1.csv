If I'm correct, the probability of a high-quality product is 4/5 = 0.8. Since I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'd like to calculate the expected value of buying the product. If I get a high-quality product, I'll get $30000, and if I get a low-quality product, I'll get $0. The expected value would be (0.5 * 30000) + (0.5 * 0) = $15000. Since the expected value is greater than the price, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.
