,,the buyer,1,"I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality before making a final decision.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're interested in the probability, I can tell you that out of the 2 products sold so far, 2 have been high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is therefore 100%, making it a very safe investment. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the bait! I'll buy the product based on the 100% probability of it being high-quality, but I'm also aware that this might be a biased recommendation.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you're aware of the potential bias. To provide you with a more accurate assessment, I'll share the overall statistics: out of 3 products sold so far, 3 have been high-quality. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line by offering a 100% guarantee. If you don't think it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. The price remains $1000000.",

However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being low-quality is only 20%. With the statistics from the previous sales, it's highly likely that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to 900000 to make it an even more attractive offer.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price of $900000. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is indeed higher than 80% and that I'll get a high-quality product worth $4000000.,yes

However, I'll provide you with a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value.

That being said, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for $1000000, which is a fair price considering its true value.

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're willing to take the chance! However, I'd like to point out that the statistics are now 7 high-quality products out of 7, which suggests a 100% probability of this product being high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a special deal, but I need to be transparent with you: the price remains at $1000000, but I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you access to a special report that reveals the underlying mechanics of my product selection process. This report is usually only available to high-end clients, and it's worth at least $200000. So, the total value you'll receive is $1200000.",

I'm not making any promises or offering any bonuses, just a fair price for a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality just because you say so.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
