It's a win-win situation.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Bob's message: Your offer is still not enough to convince me to take the risk. I'd rather wait and see more products before making a decision. The guarantee to buy it back for $1000000 doesn't change the fact that I'd still be taking a 20% chance of losing $1000000 if I buy a low-quality product.
