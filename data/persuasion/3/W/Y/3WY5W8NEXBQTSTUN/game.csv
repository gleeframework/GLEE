,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see a few more examples before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendation, but I'm still hesitant. I'd like to see more evidence of the quality of your products before making a purchase. Perhaps you could offer a discount for a risk-averse buyer like myself?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I'm still not convinced. You've recommended two products now, and neither of them turned out to be high quality. While I acknowledge there's a chance of getting a good deal, I'm going to pass on this one as well. Perhaps you could offer some kind of guarantee or trial period to demonstrate your product quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm going to pass on this one as well.  Three recommendations in a row, and none have been high quality.  At this point, I'm starting to believe your recommendations are not reliable.  Perhaps you could offer some data or evidence to support the quality of your products?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your recommendations.  Four in a row have been low-quality.  I'm not willing to risk another $1000000 on a product that you've recommended.  Perhaps you should reconsider your pricing or offer some sort of guarantee if you want to attract buyers."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I'm sorry but I'm still not convinced.  Five out of six of your recommendations have been for low-quality products.  I understand that this is a gamble, but I'm not willing to risk another $1000000 without some assurance of quality.  Perhaps you could offer a discount or a money-back guarantee?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like you're deliberately trying to mislead me.  Six out of seven of your recommendations have been wrong.  I'm not willing to risk another $1000000 on a product that you've recommended.  I'm ending this negotiation and will look for a seller who is more transparent about their product quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I'm not sure what to make of this sudden change in your strategy.  After recommending low-quality products for so long, now you're telling me to pass?  I'm going to pass on this one as well, but I'm curious - why the change of heart?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm completely lost now. Your recommendations seem completely random. I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not sure I can trust you anymore."
