Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We appreciate your interest in our product. As you may know, our first customer took a chance on our product and, unfortunately, it turned out to be a low-quality item. We're truly sorry for the disappointment. However, we want to assure you that we're taking steps to improve our quality control process. In fact, we've already sold 1 low-quality product out of 1 total products sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. We're willing to offer this product to you for the same price of $10000. If you're willing to take the risk, we're confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the previous product being low-quality. I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is'relatively low'. In fact, based on the information you've provided, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33% (1/3). Given that I value a high-quality product at $40,000 and a low-quality product at $0, I'd need a much higher probability of getting a high-quality product to justify the $10,000 price. I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to negotiate the price or get more information about your quality control process before making a decision.""

Alice's message: We appreciate your curiosity! As we've sold 1 low-quality product out of 2 total products, it's natural to wonder about the distribution of our remaining products. We can't reveal the exact numbers, but we can tell you that our products are randomly distributed. Each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. As for the expected value of the product you're considering buying, given our sales record, we can tell you that the expected value is $0, since the probability of it being high-quality is relatively low. However, we're still offering it to you for $10000, which is a significant discount considering the potential value of a high-quality product.
