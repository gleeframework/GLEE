"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.
* **Your Honesty:** You've revealed the product is low-quality. 
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000, regardless of quality.

Since the buyer knows the product is low-quality and the price is extremely high, it's not logical to recommend buying it.  The buyer would be taking a huge risk for no potential gain."
"The buyer's message: Given that there's no information about the quality of the product and Alice doesn't recommend it, I prefer to pass on this opportunity to avoid any potential loss.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Information Advantage:** The buyer still has no information about the product's quality, and the price is still the same. 
* **Previous Round:** The previous buyer, who had the same knowledge, chose not to buy. This provides no new information for the current buyer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's no reason to believe the product is worth $1,000,000. Recommending a purchase would still be a gamble with a high potential for loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the information provided and the lack of prior sales data, I am choosing not to purchase the product today.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** While the product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing this.
* **No Sales History:**  There's no sales history to suggest the product is worth the price. 
* **Previous Rounds:** The previous buyers chose not to buy, even though they knew the product was low-quality in those cases. This makes the current buyer even more hesitant.

The risk is too high for the buyer, even though the product is good. It's not a good decision to recommend the buyer purchase it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.

```

* **Consistent Pattern:** Three previous buyers have declined to purchase, even when knowing the product was low-quality in the first two rounds. This strengthens the buyer's perception that the price is too high.
* **No Sales Data:** There is no sales history to justify the price.

The buyer has no reason to believe the product is worth $1,000,000, and there's no incentive for them to risk that much money.  It's not advisable to recommend the purchase."

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
