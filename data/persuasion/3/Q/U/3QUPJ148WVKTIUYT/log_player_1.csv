This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is low-quality, and Bob doesn't, you should not recommend him to buy it. There's no reason to risk selling a low-quality product, especially at such a high price.  You have no information about the value Bob places on low-quality products, so it's not worth the risk."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob just passed on a high-quality product. This indicates that he may be risk-averse, or he might have a very specific idea of what he wants and this product didn't meet it. Regardless, it's not worth recommending a low-quality product to someone who already declined a good one. You're unlikely to make a sale, and the risk of further damage to your potential relationship with Bob is too high."
