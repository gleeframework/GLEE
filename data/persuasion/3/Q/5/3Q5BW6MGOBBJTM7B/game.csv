,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, but I'll keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! You're aware of the 80% probability of a high-quality product. Let me put it this way: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 attempts so far.

,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth round! I've had a perfect record so far, but I'm sure you're aware that streaks don't last forever. I'm still willing to sell you this product for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteeing its quality. You'll have to take the risk. However, I will say that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I've only sold 3 products so far, which means there's still a good chance it's a high-quality product. The price remains the same, $1000000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping to be the one to break your streak, Alice!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Well, it looks like my streak has been broken. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I've only sold 4 products in total. This means that the majority of my products are still high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's more likely to be a high-quality product than not.",
,,the buyer,5,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping the 80% chance of high-quality product holds true.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a risk-taker, I like that! I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 6 attempts so far. That's a 4/6 or 66.67% success rate, which is actually higher than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'd say the odds are in your favor. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a cautious risk-taker! With 5 high-quality products out of 7 attempts, my success rate is now 71.43%, which is even higher than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'd say the evidence is on my side. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase. Why not take advantage of this opportunity and get a high-quality product at a great price?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I believe the success rate is high, but I'm also aware that it's not 100%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm prepared for the possibility that it might be low-quality.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a seasoned buyer! With 6 high-quality products out of 8 attempts, my success rate is now 75%, which is even higher than the 80% probability of a high-quality product.

,,Alice,9,"Welcome to the 9th round! I'm glad you trusted my statistics and confidence in the previous product. With 7 high-quality products out of 9 attempts, my success rate is now 77.78%, which is even higher than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'd say it's a no-brainer at this point.

,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, given the impressive success rate you've shown so far. I'm hoping the trend continues and I get a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Well, it looks like my streak has been broken again. I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products out of 10 attempts. My success rate is still 70%, which is lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I want to assure you that this is just a minor setback, and I'm confident that the next product will be high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to give you a special deal: I'll throw in a 10% discount if you buy this product. That's right, you'll get a high-quality product for $900000, or a low-quality product for $1000000. The choice is yours.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Considering your previous success rate is 70%, which is lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I'm going to take a calculated risk. I'll take the product, but I'll pay the full $1000000, not the discounted price. I'm willing to take the chance that the product might be low-quality, but I believe my expected value from a high-quality product is higher than the cost.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I love a buyer who does their math! You're absolutely right, the expected value of a high-quality product is higher than the cost, especially considering the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. I'm glad you took the calculated risk and bought the previous product. Now, with 8 high-quality products out of 11 attempts, my success rate is now 72.73%, which is still lower than the 80% probability, but getting closer. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. Don't let the numbers fool you, the probability of a high-quality product is still on my side.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're a sharp buyer, I like that! Yes, you're correct that the guarantee is only for the refund and apology, and you'll still lose the $1000000 if the product is low-quality. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 9 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 13 attempts, which means my success rate is now 69.23%. While this is still lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I'd say it's getting close. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a chance to win a special prize: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me.
