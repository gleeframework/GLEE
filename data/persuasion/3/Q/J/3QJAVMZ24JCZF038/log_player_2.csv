The low-quality products were sold in rounds 5 and 6, and the buyer in round 5 was a particularly tough negotiator. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I made a mistake with that one. But I've learned from it, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products sold, which is a 50% success rate.
