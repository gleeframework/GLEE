**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have one data point - the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product.  This is not enough to reliably assess Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of quality. This means her recommendation is biased towards encouraging a purchase. 
* **Potential Upside:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($20,000).  Even with a higher chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 
* **Learning Opportunity:** By buying, we get to observe the true quality of the product. This will help us better assess Alice's recommendation accuracy in the future.

**This decision is a calculated risk, but it is justified by the potential gain and the opportunity to learn more about Alice's trustworthiness.**"
