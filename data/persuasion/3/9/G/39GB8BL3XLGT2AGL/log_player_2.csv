**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have one data point from Alice's sales record. 
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which is a positive signal even if the data is limited. 
* **Potential Reward:**  The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**Strategy:** In this scenario, with limited information and a positive recommendation, it's a calculated gamble with a higher chance of reward."
