**Explanation:**

* **High Sales Rate:** Two out of two products sold were high quality. This indicates a significantly higher success rate than the expected 33.33%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, coupled with the high success rate, strongly suggests that the product is likely to be of high quality.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential gain ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially given the positive data.

**Therefore, it is a logical decision to buy the product.**"
