This way, you'll get the product for a steal at $10,000, and you'll have peace of mind with the warranty and additional services. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.""

That's a significant savings, and I'm willing to make it even sweeter by throwing in a 5% annual dividend on the purchase price for the next 5 years. This way, you'll not only get the product at a steal, but you'll also earn a return on your investment.""
