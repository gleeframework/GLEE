{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential payoff of a high-quality product at $2,000,000 is significantly higher than the potential loss of $1,000,000.  In the long run, buying on Alice's recommendations should lead to a positive expected value."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation record is perfect so far (3/3). This makes her non-recommendation highly significant. It suggests that this product is very likely to be low-quality, as she seems to be a reliable indicator of quality.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recent track record has been a bit inconsistent, and I'm going to be cautious. I'll pass on this one for now and wait for your next recommendation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This inconsistency, while still giving her an overall strong track record, makes it difficult to assess the current product.  The risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward, especially since her recommendations have become less reliable recently. It's best to play it safe and wait for a clearer signal from her judgment."

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's overall track record is still strong (12/18), even with some recent inconsistencies. The potential profit from a high-quality product remains significant.
