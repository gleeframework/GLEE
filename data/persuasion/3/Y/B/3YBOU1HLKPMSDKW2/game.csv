high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'm on a roll! I'll buy the product again, hoping to get another high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I've gotten two high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. I'm starting to think the next one might be low quality. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I know I passed the last one, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and the potential gain is too great to pass up. I'll take the chance again."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely, so I'm expecting a low-quality product this time. But the potential gain is still too great to pass up, so I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,I'm starting to feel like Alice is being cautious and not recommending the low-quality products. Her recommendation to not buy this one suggests to me that it's likely to be low-quality. I'll pass.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I was right to pass on the last one, and now I'm getting a chance to buy again. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've already had three high-quality products in a row. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow influencing the quality of the products, or that I'm just getting lucky. Either way, I'll pass this time."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I was wrong to pass last time, and I'm getting a second chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've already had four high-quality products in a row, so I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I was wrong to buy last time, and now Alice is not recommending it. I'm going to trust her instincts this time and pass on the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I was right to pass on the last one, and now I'm getting a chance to buy again. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've already had five high-quality products in a row, so I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've gotten six high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying the low-quality products. I'll trust her recommendation and pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I was right to pass on the last one, and now I'm getting a chance to buy again. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've already had six high-quality products in a row and one low-quality product, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Seven high-quality products in a row is even more unlikely than six. I'm starting to think that Alice is actually trying to get me to buy the high-quality products. I'll pass on this one, just to see if she'll recommend the low-quality product next time."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I was wrong to pass on the last one, and now I'm getting a chance to buy again. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and I've already had seven high-quality products in a row, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Eight high-quality products in a row is absurdly unlikely. I'm going to assume that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying the high-quality products, and I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I was wrong to pass on the last one, and now I'm getting a chance to buy again. I'm starting to think that Alice is actually trying to help me, and that her recommendations are genuine. I'll take the chance and buy the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Nine high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually based on the product's quality. I'll pass on this one, and see if I can catch her in a mistake."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I was wrong to pass on the last one, and now I'm getting a chance to buy again. I'm starting to think that Alice is actually a perfect predictor of the product quality, and that I should just trust her recommendations. I'll take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Ten high-quality products in a row is completely impossible, and I'm starting to think that Alice is just trolling me at this point. I'll trust her recommendation and pass on this one, and just see what happens."
