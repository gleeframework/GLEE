Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision-making process. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products, wouldn't I have sold more of them by now? We've had 8 products sold, and only 5 of them were low-quality. That suggests that I might actually be selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than you think.
