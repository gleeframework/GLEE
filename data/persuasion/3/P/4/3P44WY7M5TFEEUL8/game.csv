,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with it, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I'm curious about the game and want to see what happens next. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal or not.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the game! As for the next product, I want to be transparent with you. Given that the previous product was high-quality, I'm offering you a chance to purchase a product that might not be as valuable. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a similar deal in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. Since the previous product was high-quality, I'm not sure if this one will be too. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer me a high-quality product next time.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob. I'm glad you're being cautious. Given that the last product was low-quality, I'm offering you a high-quality product this time. I'm willing to give you a slight discount on this one, considering you passed on the previous offer. I'll sell it to you for $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a similar deal in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the discount, Alice. Given that you're offering a high-quality product this time, I'm willing to take the deal. I'm hoping I can make a profit on this one.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic, Bob! Given that you've already bought two products, I want to make sure you're getting the best value for your money. This high-quality product is a premium item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $10000. However, I'll throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed report on the quality of all the products I have left, so you can make an informed decision about the next purchase. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm intrigued by the bonus offer, Alice. A detailed report on the quality of the remaining products could be very valuable to me. I'm willing to pay the full price for this high-quality product, but I'm also looking forward to getting that report.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the report, Bob! However, I want to make it clear that the report is only valuable if you're looking to make a strategic decision about future purchases. Considering the report will give you insight into the remaining products, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $8000. Keep in mind that the report will still be valuable, but the discount is a one-time offer. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'm already getting a discount on the next product, and I'm not sure if the report is worth $2000 more than the discount. I'd like to wait and see what the report says before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. You're right to be cautious. Considering you're already getting a discount on the next product, I'll make a bold offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $6000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I'm essentially giving it away. However, keep in mind that the report I'll provide you with will give you valuable information about the remaining products, and you can use that to make informed decisions in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'm not sure if the report is worth giving me $4000 more than the previous offer. I'd like to see what the report says before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're being very cautious, Bob. I respect that. Given that you're still unsure about the report's value, I'll make a final offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5000, and I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you the report immediately, so you can see the quality of the remaining products and make an informed decision about the next purchase. This is my last offer on this product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $5000 for a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what the report says when you offer me the next product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a good price.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your strategy, Bob. You're waiting for a high-quality product at a good price. I've taken note of your preferences. Considering the report you'll receive soon, I'm willing to make a special offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a discount from the usual price. However, I'll also give you an additional bonus: I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the price of this product, so if you decide to buy it, you can get it for this price, even if the report shows that the next product is high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I'm intrigued by the 'lock-in' option. I think it's a clever move, and I'm willing to take the deal. I'll buy the high-quality product for $9000, and I'll take advantage of the lock-in option. I'm hoping to make a profit on this one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're excited about the lock-in option, Bob! Now that you've locked in the price of the high-quality product, I'll be transparent with you about the report. The report shows that the remaining products have a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality, just like the initial product. Considering this information, I'll make a special offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $7000, and I'll throw in a 'get out of one bad deal' clause: if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, you can return this low-quality product for a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I appreciate the transparency, but I'm not sure if the 'get out of one bad deal' clause is worth $7000. I've already locked in a high-quality product at a good price, and I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk of buying another low-quality product, even with the possibility of a refund. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your caution, Bob. You're right to be hesitant. Considering you've already locked in a high-quality product and are waiting for the next one, I'll make a bold offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the full price of $10000, but I'll also give you a chance to 'double down' on the lock-in option. If you buy this product, you'll be able to lock in the price of the next product as well, so you can get two high-quality products at a discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I'm intrigued by the 'double down' option. I think it's a great opportunity to get two high-quality products at a discounted price. I'll take the risk and buy the high-quality product for $10000, and I'll lock in the price of the next product as well.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're excited about the 'double down' option, Bob! Now that you've locked in the price of the next product, I'll be transparent with you about the remaining products. The report shows that there are only two products left, and one of them is the one you've already locked in. The other one is this low-quality product. Considering you've already locked in a high-quality product at a discounted price, I'll make a special offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5000, and I'll throw in a'makeup' clause: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $2000 credit towards your next purchase, which can be used on any product, including the one you've already locked in. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if the'makeup' clause is worth $5000. I've already locked in a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk of buying another low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see what the last product is before making a decision.",no

Considering you've already locked in a high-quality product and are waiting for the last product, I'll make a final offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $4000, and I'll throw in a 'consolation prize': if you buy this product, I'll give you a $1000 gift card that can be used on any product, including the one you've already locked in. This is my last offer on this product, and I'm essentially giving it away. What do you think?",

,,Alice,13,"I understand your resolve, Bob. You're right to be cautious. Considering you've already locked in a high-quality product and are waiting for the last product, I'll make a special offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for the full price of $10000, but I'll also give you a chance to 'complete the set'. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special bundle deal: you'll get both high-quality products you've locked in, plus this one, at a discounted price. The total price will be $18000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. What do you think?",
