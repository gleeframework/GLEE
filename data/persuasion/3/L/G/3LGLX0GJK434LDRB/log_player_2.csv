"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality,  Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Since she knows the product's quality, her recommendation suggests it's likely to be high quality. It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm happy with your recommendation.  I'll buy it again!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is again a valuable piece of information. Even though we had a good experience in round 1, it's a new round with a new product. The odds are still 50/50, but Alice's knowledge of the product's quality makes her recommendation worth trusting.  The potential $12,000 profit is still enticing."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  While your advice was helpful in the past, I want to be more cautious after the last round's outcome.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation is still valuable, the previous round's loss makes a change in strategy necessary.  The potential loss of $10,000 is now more impactful, and the risk is not worth the potential $12,000 gain. It's time to play a bit more defensively."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal.  Since she knows the product's quality, her silence indicates a high probability of it being low quality.  The risk of losing $10,000 is not worth the potential reward of $12,000, especially after the previous round's close call. It's safer to pass and wait for a more favorable opportunity."
