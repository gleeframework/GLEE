{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The reasoning is the same as before:  There's no information to suggest the product is good, and a $1,000,000 price tag demands a lot of confidence.  The buyer doesn't have any reason to believe this product is worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I will choose not to buy the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation is the same as the previous rounds:

* **Alice does not recommend the product.** This implies the product is likely low-quality.
* **There's no sales history.**  The buyer has no data to suggest Alice might be offering a good deal. 
* **The price is extremely high.**  The risk of buying a low-quality product for $1 million is too great."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

The logic remains the same. No sales history exists, and the product is low-quality. There's no reason for Alice to recommend it, and the buyer has no incentive to buy it at such a high price."

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.

```

Here's why:

* **Lack of Sales History:**  The buyer has seen eight rounds with no sales, reinforcing the perception of risk. 
* **No Reason to Recommend:** Even though this product is high-quality, Alice has no reason to recommend it. The buyer would have no way of knowing this product is different from the previous ones.

The buyer likely won't change their behavior until they see some evidence that Alice is offering good deals, which would require a successful sale."
