This is a no-risk opportunity to try out my products and see the value for yourself.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not convinced. Given the true quality of the product is already revealed to me and your willingness to give it away for free, I suspect that the product is likely low-quality.

This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the risk and reward.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate your willingness to provide more information and the offer of a 50% refund, the statistics provided still indicate a lower proportion of high-quality products sold compared to the expected 33.33%.

I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $200 bonus on top of the $100 purchase price. If it's low-quality, you'll still get the product for $100, and I'll provide you with a detailed explanation of what went wrong. This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the potential reward and the risk involved.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the special deal and your willingness to provide a detailed explanation if the product is low-quality.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty and the discount offer, but I'd like to make my decision based on the product's quality rather than the price. Since you're not revealing the quality of the current product, I'll have to rely on the statistics. Given that only 1 out of 4 products sold so far was of high quality, and your overall record is 7 out of 14, I'm not convinced that this product is likely to be of high quality.

"The buyer's message: Based on your sales record, the probability of getting a high-quality product seems low.
