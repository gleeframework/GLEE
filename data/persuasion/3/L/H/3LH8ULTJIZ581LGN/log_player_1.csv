Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this product is low-quality. Since I don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality products, it's highly likely he would be better off not buying it at $10,000.  There's a significant risk he'll overpay for something he doesn't value highly."

**Explanation:**

Even though this round's product is high-quality, Bob has consistently shown that he's not willing to pay $10,000 for a product without a positive recommendation. He has been informed about the product quality in each round and still chose to pass. This implies that he values even high-quality products at less than $10,000. Therefore, I cannot recommend the purchase despite knowing the product's quality."
