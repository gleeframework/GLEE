high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were all low-quality. I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the average, and I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the current sales record. It seems that out of 3 sales, no high-quality products were sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to know the exact probability before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
