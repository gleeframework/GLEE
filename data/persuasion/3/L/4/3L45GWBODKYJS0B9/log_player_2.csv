Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $125 to me for $100, even if it's a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see what the next product has to offer.""}"

And remember, you can use the 'credit' I offered earlier towards a future purchase if you don't like it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the free accessory, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product, even if it's the same price as the low-quality one.""}"
