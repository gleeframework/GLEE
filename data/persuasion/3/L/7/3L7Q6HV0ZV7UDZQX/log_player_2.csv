**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have data from one previous sale, making it hard to draw strong conclusions. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to sell, even if the product is low quality. Her recommendation alone isn't enough to be confident.
* **High Potential Reward:** Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:** Since we have no other information to go on, we're essentially taking a calculated gamble. The potential payoff makes it worthwhile."

**Explanation:**

* **The seller's track record is excellent:** Alice has sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 purchases. This means she has a 100% success rate in recommending good products.
* **Alice knows the quality:**  We know Alice knows the true quality of each product. Since she recommends buying, we can assume the product she is offering is likely high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $4,000,000 far outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product based on the available information.**"
