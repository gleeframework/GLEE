**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  There's very little data to go on. Only one product has been sold, and it was high-quality. This is not enough to establish a pattern or make a strong prediction.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation is valuable, she has an incentive to sell you the product, regardless of its quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  

**Strategy:**  Given the limited information, it's a gamble, but the potential reward justifies the risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 4 out of 4 products sold being high quality, this is a very strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation itself adds further weight to the likelihood of this product being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $400 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $100."
