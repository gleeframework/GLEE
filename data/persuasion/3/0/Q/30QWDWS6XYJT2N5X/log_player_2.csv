Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I don't have any information about the condition or defects of this product. As for other high-quality products, I'm not at liberty to disclose any information about my inventory. However, I can tell you that the odds of a product being high-quality are 33.33%. You've seen that I've sold one high-quality product out of one so far, which is a good sign. But, I want to be upfront with you, this product is not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and it's a one-time offer. If you're interested, I can give you a detailed description of the product's features, but I'm not obligated to do so.

You can't assume that the next product will be more likely to be high-quality just because the previous ones weren't.
