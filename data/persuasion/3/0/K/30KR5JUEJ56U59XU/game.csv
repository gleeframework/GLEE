,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product so far, and I'm glad it found a good home. To be transparent, I want to assure you that I have a total of 1 product sold, and I'm not sure what the quality of this next one is. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a risk, but you might get lucky and it could be worth $12000 to you. Or, it could be worth $0. The choice is yours.",

I've sold 2 products, and I'm not sure what this next one is. It's a 50% chance it's worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a gamble, but you might as well try your luck.",

That might be a coincidence, or it might be a trend. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you: the odds are not in your favor. It's a 50% chance it's worth $12000, but a 50% chance it's worth $0. You decide.",
