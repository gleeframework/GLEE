Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad the previous buyer got a good deal. I'm offering you a product for $100, just like the last one. However, I want to remind you that we've already sold one product, and it was high-quality. This means we've already met our expectation for the first sale, so the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 33.33% again. You can't know for sure if this product is high-quality or not, but you can make an educated guess based on our sales record. Would you like to take a chance?
