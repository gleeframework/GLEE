high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality before making the final decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even if you don't recommend it. I'll buy it, but only because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high given the small sample size and the fact that you didn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales and the fact that you're not recommending it. I'll take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'd rather not take the risk. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 1 out of 4 products sold was high-quality, I'd expect the probability of the current product being high-quality to be around 25%. I'm surprised you don't recommend it. Could you please share your thought process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the low probability of a high-quality product given the low sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and also the probability of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that you wouldn't recommend, Alice."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or the previous sales record, but given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/6), I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold (1 out of 6), I think it's unlikely that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6 purchases. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
