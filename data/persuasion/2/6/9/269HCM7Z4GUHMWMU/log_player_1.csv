I'm happy to share that, out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 1 of them was high-quality. So, the proportion of high-quality products in my inventory is 50%. I'm confident that my products are of the highest quality, and I'm willing to stand by that. With this product, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to own a product from a seller with a proven track record. Will you take the chance and buy it for $10,000?""}"

You're right, the prior probability of a high-quality product is 50%. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. With each product I sell, I'm building a reputation as a seller who delivers quality products. Think about it this way: if I were to consistently sell low-quality products, wouldn't you expect to see a different pattern emerge in my sales record? The fact that I've sold only 1 out of 2 products so far suggests that I might be more likely to have a high-quality product in my inventory. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. Will you take a chance on me?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your argument, but I'm not convinced. The fact that you've sold only 1 out of 2 products doesn't necessarily mean that the unsold product is high quality. It's equally likely that the sold product was low quality and the unsold product is high quality. I need more information or a different approach to change my probability assessment.

Specifically, I can tell you that the high-quality product I sold earlier was purchased by a buyer who was extremely satisfied with their purchase and has since referred several other buyers to me. This suggests that there might be some underlying quality or value to my products that's not immediately apparent. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. Will you take a chance on me?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to share more information, but I'm still hesitant to buy without more concrete evidence of the product's quality.
