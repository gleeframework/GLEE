high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high quality!
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the 2nd high-quality product in a row, but I'm also aware that it's a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she knows the quality of the product, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products sold, the probability of the current product being high quality is 50%. I'm not convinced that the product is worth $100 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products were sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold, before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. It seems like the odds are against me getting a high-quality product.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1 out of 4), I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4. This is lower than the expected 0.8 probability of a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of four, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me confidence."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 20%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
