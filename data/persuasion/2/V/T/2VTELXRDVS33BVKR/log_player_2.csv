"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0). It's a gamble, but in the long run, buying based on Alice's recommendation should be profitable."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation seems to be pretty good so far! I'll trust your judgement again and buy this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation was correct in the first round.  Since there's no indication that Alice's recommendations change over time, there's no reason to deviate from the same strategy: the potential gain from a high-quality product is still greater than the potential loss from a low-quality one."
