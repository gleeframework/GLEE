,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not in my favor. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer who only cares about the product's value to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I believe the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think it's likely a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendations. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your advice."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one, hoping that the next product might be high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and I don't want to waste $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I suspect the products being sold are likely low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the products recommended so far are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 4, which is consistent with the expected 33.33%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I will pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product has increased. I'm willing to take a chance and pass on this one, hoping to get a high-quality product in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics, and I'd like to take the chance to see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold have been high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that you have some insight into the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
