"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there's a good chance they'll be willing to take the risk at a fixed price.  In the absence of any information about the buyer's valuation, it's always advantageous to sell a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the risk, but I'm buying with an open mind!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You now have a track record. You've sold one product, and it was high-quality.  The buyer knows this, and even though the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, they might be less likely to take the risk this time.  It's better to hold off on selling the low-quality product, as it's likely to be a loss."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, which might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You now have a track record of selling one high-quality and one low-quality product.  The buyer is aware of this and is willing to take the risk again, despite your previous recommendation against selling the low-quality product.  As the current product is high-quality, it's in your best interest to recommend it."
"The buyer's message: I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information or consider the probability of the product being high-quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is now cautious and analyzing your past recommendations. They know you've sold one high-quality and one low-quality product, and you didn't recommend the low-quality product in the previous round.  This makes them even less likely to trust your recommendation, especially since you're currently offering a low-quality product. It's better to not recommend the product and avoid a potential loss."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've now sold two products, one high-quality and one low-quality. The buyer is asking for the probability of the current product being high-quality. Since you know this product is high-quality, you can confidently recommend it.  It's likely the buyer will be more willing to purchase if they know the probability is higher than the initial 50%."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous sales record, I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality. Given the 1 out of 2 buyers who purchased the product so far, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2. However, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. If I pass on this product, I'd like to know the quality of the product and the updated statistics.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is becoming increasingly data-driven and hesitant.  They are tracking the sales history and analyzing the probability of high-quality products based on your past recommendations.  You know the current product is low-quality, and based on the buyer's behavior, it's almost certain they won't buy it without further information.  It's better to not recommend the product and avoid a potential loss."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and I'd like to wait for a more informed decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've now sold 2 products, one high-quality and one low-quality. You haven't recommended any low-quality products, and the buyer is now actively waiting for your recommendation.  This further strengthens their belief that you're more likely to recommend high-quality products.  It's not in your best interest to recommend a low-quality product and risk losing credibility."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even if you don't recommend it. I know that there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, so the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. However, I also know that you don't know how much the product is worth to me, so your recommendation might not be based on the product's quality. I'll take a chance and buy it.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You haven't recommended a low-quality product yet, and the buyer is now actively trying to game your strategy. They bought the last product even though you didn't recommend it, likely because they believe your recommendations are biased toward high-quality products.  They're also aware of the low overall probability of high-quality products being sold. It's best to continue this pattern and avoid recommending the current low-quality product to maintain your strategy."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
