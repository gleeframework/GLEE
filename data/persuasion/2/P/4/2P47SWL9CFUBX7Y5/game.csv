low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first mover, but I'm aware that I have no prior information to make an informed decision. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the data so far. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, the probability that the product is high quality is 0.8, but the fact that you don't recommend it makes me suspicious. I'll take the risk and buy it anyway."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sales to make a more informed decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed, I'm inclined to think that the products they saw were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 80% I initially thought. I'd like to see if Alice's recommendation holds up in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice has recommended 2 previous buyers to buy and neither of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low quality. Since the probability of a product being low quality is 20%, it's possible that the product I'm being offered is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and how many total products have been offered."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has seen 2 low-quality products sold, which would increase the likelihood of the current product being low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers who purchased the products didn't get high-quality ones, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 80%"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%, which is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the product's quality for myself and update the statistics."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products might have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to know the number of products Alice has left in stock."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product with a 20% chance of being worthless, especially when the previous buyers have not found any high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the past sales record or something else?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 20.00%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers have not been successful, and Alice's recommendation may not be reliable."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
