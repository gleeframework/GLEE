high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of previous sales and the fact that the first buyer didn't find a high-quality product. I'd like to know more about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take a chance on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'd like to know the updated probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different offer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products sold were low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for more information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I believe the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I would like to pass on this product."
