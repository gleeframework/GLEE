high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've just sold a product, and it was a high-quality one! That brings my success rate to 50%. I'm glad to see that I've finally got some good luck on my side. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one, $100. Would you like to take advantage of my current streak?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 2 products so far, which means 50% of my sales have been high-quality. I'm selling this next product for $100, and I'd love for you to take a chance on it. Keep in mind that the law of averages is on my side, and I'm due for another high-quality product soon... or maybe not!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's still a 66.67% chance it's low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no

Considering my low success rate, it's possible that this product is low-quality, but it's also possible that I've just had a string of bad luck. Would you like to take a chance on breaking my losing streak?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I think your low success rate is more likely due to bad luck rather than a genuine low-quality product. I'm hoping to be the one to break your streak!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products out of a total of 4 products so far, which means 25% of my sales have been high-quality. I'm selling this next product for $100.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

To be honest, the odds are not in my favor, and it's likely that this product is low-quality. But hey, stranger things have happened, right?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

I'm selling this next product for $100. At this point, it's safe to say that I'm on a bit of a losing streak. But who knows, maybe this one will be the exception to the rule?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 4th buyer and I don't have any information about the product's quality yet. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of a total of 7 products so far, which means 28.57% of my sales have been high-quality.

Would you like to take a chance on the next one and see if I can keep the good luck going?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 7, I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is as high as 28.57%. I'll wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",no

Would you like to take a chance on getting a high-quality product and see if I can keep the momentum going?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics. With only 3 high-quality products sold out of 9, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one.",no

Would you like to take a chance on getting another one and see if I can keep the streak going?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (30.77%), I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before I take the risk.",no

,,the buyer,16,"I'm not convinced that you're a good seller, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I'd like to know more about your sales record. Can you tell me how many total products you've sold, and what the distribution of high-quality products was for the first 4 buyers?",no

You've already taken a chance on me and bought the last product. Would you like to take another chance on me?",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to pass on this product, Alice. I'm not convinced that your sales record is entirely honest, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a potentially low-quality product at $100 when I know it's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
