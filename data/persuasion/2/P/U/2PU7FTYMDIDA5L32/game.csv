high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"You are correct to question our probability calculation. We apologize for any confusion. Upon further review, we realize that our previous statement was incorrect. The correct probability calculation would be based on the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products offered, not just the number of products sold. Unfortunately, we don't have the exact number of products offered, as it's not publicly available information. However, we can assure you that our products are carefully selected and inspected to ensure they meet our high standards. At $1000000, we believe it's a worthwhile investment for someone who values exceptional quality. Will you take the chance to own a premium product?",
,,the buyer,20,I'd like to understand the probability calculation better. Can you provide more information about the total number of products offered and the total number of products sold?
