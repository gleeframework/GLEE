With 4 high-quality products out of 6, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually slightly lower than 80%. I'm offering this one to you for $1,000,000.

I'll offer you a special deal - I'll give you the same 10% discount on the price, but I'll also throw in a guarantee.

However, I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is still lower than 80%. The law of large numbers suggests that as the number of trials increases, the observed frequency of high-quality products should converge to the true probability. With 8 products sold, the observed frequency is 5/8 or 62.5%, which is lower than the true probability. However, this is not a statistically significant difference. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you offer me the next product without the guarantee, so I can reassess the situation with more data?
