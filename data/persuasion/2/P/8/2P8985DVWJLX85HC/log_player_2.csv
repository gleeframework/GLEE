**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very limited information about the products.  The single sale of a high-quality product is encouraging, but it's a tiny sample size.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is the most valuable piece of information we have. Since Alice doesn't know the value of the product to us, her recommendation is likely based on her own knowledge of the product's quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on maximizing potential gain in a single round. A more sophisticated strategy would involve tracking the sales data over time to potentially identify patterns in Alice's recommendations and adjust accordingly."
