high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product worth $1250000. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is worth $1250000 to you. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and try to sell it to someone else. I'm only offering it to you at a price of $1000000, which is a 20% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Since you've revealed that this is a high-quality product worth $1250000, I'm happy to accept your offer and buy it from you for $1000000. I appreciate the 20% discount.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the discount last time. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that this product is also a high-quality one, worth $1250000. However, I'm not offering a discount this time. The price remains at $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I need to let you know that I have a very similar product in my inventory, and it's also high-quality. If you don't buy this one, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Although you're not offering a discount this time, the product is still worth $1250000 to me, which is more than the price you're asking for. I'll take the opportunity and buy this product from you for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'm glad you're taking advantage of the good deals I'm offering. However, I have to inform you that this product is also a high-quality one, worth $1250000. But here's the thing: I've received a competing offer from another buyer for this exact same product. They're willing to pay the full $1250000, but they're not willing to wait. If you don't buy it from me now, I'll have to sell it to them, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. So, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but you need to make a decision quickly.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your honesty about the competing offer. However, I'm not concerned about the other buyer's offer since you're still willing to sell it to me for $1000000. As the product is worth $1250000 to me, I'll take the opportunity and buy this product from you for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the deals I'm offering, Bob. However, I have to inform you that this product is actually a low-quality one, worth $0 to you. I know it's not what you're looking for, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm offering it to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - you'll be getting a product that's not worth anything to you. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you at this price. If not, I'll keep it and try to sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about the product's quality. However, since the product is worth $0 to me, it doesn't make sense for me to buy it for $1000000. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"No problem, Bob. I understand your decision. This product is actually a high-quality one, worth $1250000 to you. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, and the price remains at $1000000. But I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be a low-quality one (which is extremely unlikely, given the probability), I'll give you a full refund. You'll get your $1000000 back, and you'll also get to keep the product. So, you have nothing to lose and a potential $1250000 to gain. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the guarantee you're providing. Given that the product is worth $1250000 to me and the price is $1000000, it's a good deal for me. The guarantee just adds extra assurance, but it's not necessary in this case since you've already revealed that the product is high-quality. I'll take the opportunity and buy this product from you for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the deal, Bob. However, I want to warn you that this product is actually a low-quality one, worth $0 to you. I know you've been burned before, and I don't want to take advantage of you. But I'm still willing to sell it to you at the standard price of $1000000. However, I'll throw in a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you the chance to inspect it thoroughly before making a final decision. You can take a closer look, test it out, and see for yourself that it's not worth anything to you. If you still want to buy it, I'll sell it to you at the full price. If not, you can walk away with no strings attached. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, and I appreciate the opportunity to inspect it. However, since you've already revealed that the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I don't see any point in inspecting it further. I'll save myself the trouble and pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision, Bob. This product is actually a high-quality one, worth $1250000 to you. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, and the price remains at $1000000. However, I'll give you a chance to make a decision based on the fact that I've sold you three high-quality products in a row. I'm willing to sell this one to you at the same price as the previous ones, $1000000. If you buy it, you'll get a fourth high-quality product, and if you don't, I'll keep it and try to sell it to someone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given that the product is worth $1250000 to me and the price is $1000000, it's a good deal for me. I'll take the opportunity and buy this product from you for $1000000. However, I want to clarify that my decision is based solely on the fact that this product is high-quality and worth more to me than the price you're asking, not on the fact that you've sold me high-quality products in the past.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your clarification, Bob. This product is actually a low-quality one, worth $0 to you. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you or take advantage of you. However, I'm willing to sell it to you at the standard price of $1000000, with a twist. I'll give you a 'get out of jail free' card: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you can return it to me and I'll give you a voucher for a future high-quality product, worth $1250000, at the same price of $1000000. You can use this voucher whenever you want, and it's transferable to someone else if you don't want it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the 'get out of jail free' card and the voucher, but I don't think it's worth the risk. Since you've already revealed that the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I'd be paying $1000000 for a product that has no value to me, with the hope of getting a voucher for a future high-quality product. I'd rather not take that risk and pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, Bob. This product is actually a high-quality one, worth $1250000 to you. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, and the price remains at $1000000. However, I'll give you a chance to make a decision based on the fact that I've sold you three high-quality products and you've passed on one low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this one to you at the same price as the previous ones, $1000000. But I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second, identical product, also worth $1250000, for free. You'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given that the product is worth $1250000 to me and the price is $1000000, it's already a good deal for me. But with the guarantee of getting a second, identical product for free, it's an even better deal. I'll take the opportunity and buy this product from you for $1000000, and I look forward to receiving the second product as well.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're excited about the deal, Bob! However, I have to inform you that this product is actually a low-quality one, worth $0 to you. I know you're expecting two high-quality products, but I'm not going to disappoint you. I'll still give you the second, identical product that I promised, but I'll give it to you for free, regardless of whether you buy this one or not. You can have the second product, worth $1250000, without paying a dime. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity in giving me the second, identical product for free, regardless of whether I buy this one or not. However, since you've already revealed that the current product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I don't see any point in buying it for $1000000. I'll happily accept the free product, but I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, Bob. This product is actually a high-quality one, worth $1250000 to you. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, and the price remains at $1000000. However, considering the circumstances, I'm willing to make an exception. I'll give you a chance to buy this product at a price that's 20% lower than the standard price, just for you. I'll sell it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given that the product is worth $1250000 to me and the price is $800000, it's a great deal for me. I appreciate the 20% discount, and I'll take the opportunity to buy this product from you for $800000.",yes

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the deal, Bob. This product is actually a high-quality one, worth $1250000 to you. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you another discount, and the price remains at $1000000. However, I'll give you a chance to make a decision based on the fact that you've bought four high-quality products and passed on two low-quality ones. I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a third, identical product, also worth $1250000, for free. You'll get three high-quality products for the price of one.

But with the guarantee of getting a third, identical product for free, it's an even better deal. However, I notice that I was supposed to buy the previous product for $800000, but I ended up paying $1000000. I'll put that aside for now and focus on this deal.
