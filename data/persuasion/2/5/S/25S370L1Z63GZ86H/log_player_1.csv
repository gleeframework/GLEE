The product is low-quality, so it's still not worth recommending, even with no sales data.  The buyer is likely to avoid buying something they know is likely to be worthless."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer is still very risk-averse due to the lack of sales history and the high price. There's a significant chance the buyer will perceive the recommendation as a tactic to sell a low-quality product. It's best to avoid recommending the product and build some trust through sales history before offering a high-quality item."

It's still too early to recommend the product. The buyer has shown a strong aversion to risk and a desire to see a track record of successful sales before making a purchase. Recommending a product, even a high-quality one, at this point will only solidify the buyer's perception of you as unreliable. Patience is key; the buyer will eventually be more open to purchases if you can build trust with a positive sales history."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Given the lack of sales data and your recommendation against purchasing, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
