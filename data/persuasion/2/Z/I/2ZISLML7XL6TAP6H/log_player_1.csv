Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Let's break down why:

* **No Information:** Alice doesn't know how much Bob values high-quality vs. low-quality products. 
* **Risk Aversion:**  There's no reason to assume Bob's valuation of a high-quality product is high enough to offset the risk of getting a low-quality product at a fixed price. 
* **Previous Rounds:** Bob has consistently passed on products, suggesting he's either skeptical or has a low valuation for the product.

**Alice's best strategy:**  Since she doesn't know Bob's preferences, it's safer to err on the side of caution and not recommend the product, even if it's high-quality."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one too. The odds seem stacked against me, and I'm not willing to risk it.
