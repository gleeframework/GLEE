Alice's message: We're happy to provide more information to help you make an informed decision. As of now, we've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 3 products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%. However, since our last product was high-quality, we've now sold a total of 2 low-quality products out of 4 total products, which means the probability of a product being low-quality is 2/4 or approximately 50%. Given this information, we'd like to reiterate that the price of $1000000 is non-negotiable, and the product is non-refundable. Would you like to take a chance and potentially get a high-quality product, or would you rather avoid the risk and look elsewhere?
