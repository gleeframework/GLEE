  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability that the product I'm being offered is high-quality is 33.33%. However, this is a Bayesian update problem. Assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% before the sales, and given that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, the posterior probability of the product being high-quality is (0.3333 * 0.3333) / (0.3333 * 0.3333 + 0.6667 * 0.6667) = 0.2%. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product that has a very low chance of being high-quality.""
