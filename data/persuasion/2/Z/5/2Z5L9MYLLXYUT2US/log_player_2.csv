"Round 1

This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is worth $20000 to you. If you don't, I'll just throw it away, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity.

As it turns out, this next product I have is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000 again, just like the last one.

Round 3
Alice's message: You're hesitant to take another chance on a high-quality product for $10000. I completely understand. Let me put it this way: I've already sold you a high-quality product for $10000, and I've got another one that's just as valuable. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll be willing to give you the same deal. You're essentially leaving money on the table if you don't take this opportunity. What do you say?

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth anything to you. You'll essentially be paying $10000 for nothing. If you're feeling generous or just want to help me out, you can take it off my hands. Otherwise, I'll just dispose of it.

You've already seen that I can deliver on my promises, and I'm confident that this product is just as valuable as the previous ones. If you don't take this opportunity, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and they might not be willing to give you the same deal. What do you say?

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance. However, I want to make it clear that this next product is not high-quality. I'm not trying to trick you, but I'm being upfront with you again. This product is worth $0 to you, and you'll essentially be paying $10000 for nothing. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price because I know you're a savvy buyer and you'll make a smart decision. If you're feeling generous or just want to help me out, you can take it off my hands.

This next product is just as valuable, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price. You've seen that I can deliver on my promises, and I'm confident that this product is worth $20000 to you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your caution, Bob. You're thinking strategically, and I respect that. Let me put it this way: you've already taken a chance on three high-quality products and come out ahead. If you pass on this next one, you'll be leaving $20000 on the table. I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a special bonus of $5000. That way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""The guarantee is a nice touch, Alice. With the bonus, the product would be worth $25,000 to me, which is a great deal. I'll take the risk and buy the high-quality product.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'm glad you took advantage of the bonus offer. As it turns out, the next product I have is high-quality. I want to make it clear that I'm not just selling you a product, I'm offering you a chance to maximize your returns. You've already taken a chance on four high-quality products and come out ahead. This next one is just as valuable, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price. But here's the thing: if you buy this one, I'll give you another bonus of $5000, just like last time. That way, you'll be getting a total of $25000 for this product, which is an unbeatable deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm getting a bit tired of taking risks.

Round 11
Alice's message: I understand you're feeling cautious, Bob. Let me ask you a question: have you ever regretted buying a high-quality product from me? You've already gotten four of them at $10000 each, and you've come out ahead every time. I'm willing to sell you this next high-quality product for the same price, and I'm confident that it will be worth $20000 to you. Think about it this way: you've already made a profit on the last four products, and this one is just as valuable. What do you have to lose by taking another chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your confidence in your products, but I'm just not feeling it anymore.

It's not a high-quality product, but it's a nice gesture. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even with the gift card. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to let me have the product at a discounted price, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Round 14

I've got a warehouse full of products, and I really need to clear some space. I'm willing to give you an extremely generous deal on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000.
