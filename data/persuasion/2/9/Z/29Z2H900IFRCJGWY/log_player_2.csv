**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** With a 100% success rate (2/2 high-quality products sold)  based on Alice's recommendations, it's highly likely that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Potential Gain:**  A high-quality product is worth $400, and the cost is only $100.  The potential profit is significant.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance the product is low quality, the high success rate from previous buyers makes the risk worth taking."
