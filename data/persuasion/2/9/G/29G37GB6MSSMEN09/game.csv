Plus, think about the value of the gift card I offered earlier - it's like getting $20 for free! You can use it towards a future purchase, or even give it to someone as a gift. It's a win-win. I'm willing to sweeten the deal even more - if you buy this product, I'll throw in a second gift card for another $20. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the convenience and the gift card offers, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $100 to me. I'd rather wait for a better option, even if it means waiting a bit longer. Can I pass on this one?",no
