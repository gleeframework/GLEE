,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm skeptical about the chances of this product being high-quality."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is still 33.33% and the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or for Alice to provide more context before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you're not recommending it. Given the low success rate of previous buyers, I'm hoping to catch a low-quality product at the low price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low quality, which would be a good deal for me. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 9 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the products you've been offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
