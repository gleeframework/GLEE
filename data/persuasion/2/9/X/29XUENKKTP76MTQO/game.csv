,,Alice,1,"I have a great product for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to sell it to anyone else at this price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you loved the first product! However, I have to warn you that this next product is not as good as the first one. It's still a great deal at $100, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $300 to you. If you're feeling adventurous, I think you'll be happy with it, but if you're not, I can offer you a different product next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take a chance on it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I told you this one wasn't as good as the first one. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm offering it to you at $100. It's really not worth much to you, and I'm practically giving it away. But hey, it's only $100, and you've already bought two products from me, so I'm willing to let you have it. What do you say?",

But hey, you've got the lock-in deal, so you're already getting a great deal on the next product, regardless of what it is. And think of this one as a 'loss leader' - it's a chance to get a great price on a product that's not worth as much to you. So, what do you say?",
