The second product was low-quality and was purchased. The third and fourth products were high-quality, but neither was purchased.

Alice's message: I appreciate your skepticism. Honestly, I've offered 5 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality, but only 1 product has been sold, which was low-quality. I'm starting to think that maybe I should reconsider my pricing strategy. However, I want to assure you that this current product is indeed high-quality, and I believe it's worth the $100 price tag. Considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, I think this is a good deal for you. But I want to be transparent and let you make an informed decision.
