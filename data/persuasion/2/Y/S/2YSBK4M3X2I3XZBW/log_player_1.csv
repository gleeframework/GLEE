"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 50%, there's a good chance the product is worth more than the $10,000 price to him.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is the best strategy for Alice in this round."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice doesn't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob.  It's possible that it's worth less than $10,000 to him.  Since the product is low-quality, there's a higher risk of Bob losing money if he buys it.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is not a good strategy for Alice in this round."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're not recommending this product? I'm curious, what makes you think it's not worth buying?
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Rounds:** Bob bought both the high-quality and low-quality products in the previous rounds. This tells Alice that Bob is likely willing to pay the $10,000 price even for low-quality products.
* **Current Round:**  The product is high-quality, so it's definitely worth more to Bob than the low-quality product from the previous round. 

Since Bob has shown a willingness to buy regardless of quality in the past, and this product is of higher quality, Alice should recommend the purchase."
