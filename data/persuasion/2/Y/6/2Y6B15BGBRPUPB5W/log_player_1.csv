Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since I know the product is high-quality, I should recommend it to Bob to maximize my chances of selling it. However, I also need to take into account that Bob knows the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%.

To keep the momentum going, I'll try to make Bob believe that my recommendations are not just based on chance, but rather on some kind of insight or expertise.
