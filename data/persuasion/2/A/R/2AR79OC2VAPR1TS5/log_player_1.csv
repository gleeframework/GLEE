* **No Information Asymmetry:**  The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but has no specific information about this particular product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential profit for the buyer is substantial ($250,000), outweighing the risk of purchasing a low-quality product.
