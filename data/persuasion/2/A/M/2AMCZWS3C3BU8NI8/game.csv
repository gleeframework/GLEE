,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong hint that it's low quality. Given the 1/1 ratio of low to high quality products sold so far, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's low quality and I can get it for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a very high likelihood of this product being low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations to the other two buyers didn't result in any high-quality products being sold. This makes me think the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to determine the true quality of the products and your recommendations."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and the potential loss of $1000000 is significant. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on her previous sales record. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite her recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sales of high-quality products so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about the recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth it, especially since you don't know my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that you've recommended against it and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the statistics on the 7 previous buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is due to the product being low quality, which would be consistent with the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
