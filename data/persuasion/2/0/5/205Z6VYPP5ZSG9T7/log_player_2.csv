Alice's message: I can provide you with the updated probability. Given that 5 high-quality products were sold out of the first 10, and you're the 11th buyer, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. The probability that the current product is high-quality, given that 5 high-quality products were sold out of the first 10, is actually 5/10 or 50%.
