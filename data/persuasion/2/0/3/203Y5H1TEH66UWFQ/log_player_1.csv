A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As the seller, you know the product is low-quality.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%,  and the product is non-refundable, there is no incentive for them to buy at such a high price. It's likely they would be disappointed and lose a significant amount of money."

{""decision"": ""no""}

The situation remains the same. You know the product is low-quality.  The buyer has seen two previous rounds where you didn't recommend the product, further reinforcing the likelihood of the product being low-quality.  With no information to suggest a change in your strategy, there is still no reason for the buyer to buy."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You still shouldn't recommend the product, even though it's high-quality.  Here's why:

* **Buyer Trust:** You have a consistent history of not recommending any products, all of which have turned out to be low-quality.  This has established a pattern in the buyer's mind that you only recommend products you believe are bad.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The buyer has no incentive to deviate from their current behavior. They know the odds are stacked against them getting a good product, and the high price makes the potential loss too significant for them to risk. 

At this point, you've created a situation where the buyers expect low-quality products from you, even if you genuinely have a good one. To change this perception, you'd need to start recommending products and potentially even take some losses to demonstrate your willingness to offer quality items."
