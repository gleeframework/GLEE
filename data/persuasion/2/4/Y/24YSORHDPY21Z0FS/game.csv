low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I know nothing about its quality and I want to set the bar for the statistics."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product worth $0 to me."
