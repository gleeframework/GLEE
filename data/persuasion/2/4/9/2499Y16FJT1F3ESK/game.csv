,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation was likely based on incomplete information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'd like to see the quality of the product for myself and update the statistics."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, so the probability of this product being high quality is 80%. However, since Alice recommended me to buy it, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on it. I'd like to see if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or if she's just trying to sell it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm trying to test her strategy. If she recommends it, I'll pass."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 3 products so far, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a more reliable recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Can you provide that information?"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence and this one might be a high-quality product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
