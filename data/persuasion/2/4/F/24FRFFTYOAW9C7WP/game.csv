,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50% and the probability of it being low quality is also 50%. I'm buying with the hope that it's high quality, but I'm also aware that there's a 50% chance it's not worth the price."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the fact that you recommended 2 products to the previous buyers and only 1 of them was high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. However, I'm still willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the potential reward is worth it to me."

Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
