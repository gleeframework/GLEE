low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information to go on. I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'll wait for more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have rejected the products and none were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. Given the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the probability of a product being high-quality (0/4 = 0 vs 33.33%), so I'll wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the average, making it a better deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the lack of high-quality products sold is representative of the overall quality of the products, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's low quality so I can save $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the statistics or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 7 out of 7 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products sold were low quality, which is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely low quality as well. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have not been favorable and I'm not sure if this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more information or a better recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is also low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're offering me might also be low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 7 buyers all bought the products despite your recommendations, which might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 7 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
