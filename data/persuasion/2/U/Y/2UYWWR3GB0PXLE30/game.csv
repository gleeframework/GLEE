low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not binding, and I'll make my decision based on my own analysis. I'll take the product regardless of its quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the lack of sales data and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous sales record. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product to try to get the high-quality one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than expected, and I might get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers also passed on the products and none were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about your thought process behind not recommending it to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. This suggests that the product may be low-quality, and I'm hoping to take advantage of that information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales records and what led you to recommend against it? I'd like to make an informed decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Based on the 4 previous sales, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that the products are all low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the previous sales record, but I'd like to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product based on Alice's recommendation, I'm curious about the product's quality. If it's high-quality, it's likely that Alice would have recommended it, but since she didn't, I'm inclined to think it might be low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, to better understand the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the others, and I'm hoping to be the one to finally sell one to you."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you're not recommending it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk since it's a 50% chance of being high quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price of $1000000."
