**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.
* **The statistics:** Although we have limited data (only one previous buyer), it shows that a high-quality product was sold. 
* **The risk/reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant compared to the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0).  
* **Limited information:** We lack information about the specific qualities of the product, but the recommendation and the previous sale create a positive bias.

While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward justifies taking the risk in this case."
