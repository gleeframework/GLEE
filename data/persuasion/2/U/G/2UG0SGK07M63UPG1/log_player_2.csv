**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has recommended 12 products, and all of them have been high-quality. This suggests Alice has perfect information about the products' quality.
* **High Expected Value:** Given Alice's perfect track record, buying the product has a near-certain chance of being high quality, meaning a $400 gain for you. 
* **No Downside:**  Even if the product turned out to be low-quality (which is highly unlikely based on the data), you would only lose $100, which is far less than the potential $400 gain. 

Therefore, given the information, buying the product is the rational decision."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** 15 buyers have purchased, and all 15 products were high-quality. This suggests a strong likelihood that Alice is reliably identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:** She is recommending this specific product to you, further increasing the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Expected value:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of $400 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $100 (if it's low quality).

**While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the available information strongly suggests that this is a good opportunity to purchase.**"
