,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing your recommendation on the previous sales data or something else?"

,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers have not found any high-quality products. I'd like to know the updated statistics after my decision, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products have been sold), I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or consider the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll take it, hoping it's a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. I think there's a high chance it's a low-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. Given the low-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers, who had the same information as me, have chosen to buy, and yet none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been misled by Alice's recommendations, and I'd rather not fall into the same trap."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer. If she recommends it, I would be more cautious, but since she doesn't, I'll take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to pass on the product. I'm also considering the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality one, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
