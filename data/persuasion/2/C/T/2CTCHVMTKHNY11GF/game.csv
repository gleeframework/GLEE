low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to trick me, and the fact that she recommends buying it after 2 previous buyers passed on it suggests that the product is more likely to be low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's high-quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might lead her to recommend low-quality products to maximize her sales. I'd like to wait and see how the next buyer reacts before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100, which is still a good deal for me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance, I'll pass on the product to avoid a potential loss."
