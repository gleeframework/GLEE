Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the 'guarantee', but I'm not convinced. Since I know the product is low-quality, I don't think I'll get any value out of it, even with the refund. I'll pass on this one.""}"

If you're not, then maybe this isn't the right product for you. But if you're feeling lucky, I'll still throw in that 100% refund guarantee.
