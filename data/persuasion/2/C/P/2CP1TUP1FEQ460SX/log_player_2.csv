"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 20% discount. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price, and you might miss out on a great deal. What do you say?

However, I have to inform you that the product you just bought was indeed high-quality, but I'm not going to offer you another high-quality product at a discount. This time, I'm offering you a product that I'm confident is high-quality, but I'm not willing to give you a discount. The price remains the same, $10000. I'm willing to take on the risk of you not buying it if you're not convinced. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence, Alice. Given the value I received from the previous high-quality product, I'm willing to pay the full price of $10,000 for this product as well.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I completely understand your decision last round, and I respect your caution. However, I want to assure you that this product is a completely different story. I've had it inspected by a third-party expert, and they've given it a clean bill of health. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a significantly lower price than its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long it will last.
