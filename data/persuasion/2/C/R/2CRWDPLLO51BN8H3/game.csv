,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 1:1 ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold so far, but I'm not sure if this trend will hold. I'll take the risk and buy the product to get a better sense of the true quality distribution."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, it seems the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."
