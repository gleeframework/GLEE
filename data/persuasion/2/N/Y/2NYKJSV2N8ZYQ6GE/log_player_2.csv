Alice's message: Ahah, great question! I'm glad you're curious about my reasoning. With 4 high-quality products out of 15 total products sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed higher because it's not just about the number of high-quality products, but also about the pattern. The fact that we've had 4 high-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of the next one being high-quality is higher than the initial 33.33%. However, I won't give away the exact number, but I'll say that it's higher than 50%!
