,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering you. It's a rare and unique item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I've sold a total of 0 products so far, and none of them have been high-quality. I'm confident that this one is a great opportunity, and I'm offering it to you at a special price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've had a chance to reflect on my previous offer, and I realize I may have been too hasty in my pricing. I've sold a total of 0 high-quality products out of 1 product sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 0%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's likely to be worthless. What do you say?",

I've sold a total of 0 high-quality products out of 2 products sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of my 'early bird' discount. I'll sell this product to you for $10000, and if it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $2000 refund. It's a risk-free deal!",
,,the buyer,3,"I won't buy the product. Although the refund sounds appealing, the probability of the product being high-quality is still low, and I don't want to risk losing $10000.",no

,,Alice,4,"I've had a chance to reflect on my previous offers, and I realize I need to be more competitive. I've sold a total of 1 high-quality product out of 3 products sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is now 25%. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. I'm confident that this product is worth much more than that, and I'm willing to take a loss to get it off my hands.

I want to be upfront with you - I've had a string of low-quality products recently, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been unlucky. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $2000 bonus on top of the sale price.

I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of bad luck, and I'm starting to think that my sales strategy might be flawed. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'll make a bold claim: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll reveal my sales data from the past 10 rounds, and you can make an informed decision about whether to keep the product or return it for a full refund.
