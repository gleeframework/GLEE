,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 33.33%, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high given the previous sales record"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that you've recommended against it, I'm assuming the product is more likely to be low quality. I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice's recommendation is based on the proportion of high-quality products sold, which is 0 so far. This means that the prior probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm essentially betting against Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can I see the product's quality after I pass? I'm curious to know whether it's high or low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, given that you don't recommend it. With 8 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it seems like a high proportion of products sold were low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that the previous 9 buyers have all passed on the product and none of them found a high-quality product. The fact that you don't recommend it might suggest that it's low quality, but I'm willing to take the chance and buy it for the potential of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'll make my own decision based on the probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know what your reasoning is for not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the low quality of the products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
