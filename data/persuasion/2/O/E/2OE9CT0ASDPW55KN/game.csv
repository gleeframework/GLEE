high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the club! You're absolutely right, our previous buyers have made great decisions.

,,the buyer,6,"I'm glad to hear that the previous buyers made good decisions, but I'm not convinced that the high-quality rate is higher than 80%. I'll take the product, but I'm going to do my own math to verify the actual high-quality rate.",yes
