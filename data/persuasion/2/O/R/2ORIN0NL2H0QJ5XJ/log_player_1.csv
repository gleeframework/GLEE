There are a couple of reasons for this recommendation: 

1. **Lack of Information:** The buyer has no way to distinguish between a high and low-quality product. They are relying solely on the seller's recommendation. 
2. **Previous Positive Experience:** The buyer has seen two successful transactions so far, both with high-quality products. This could lead them to believe there is a higher probability of receiving a high-quality product. 

While it's a gamble for the buyer, from the seller's perspective, there's nothing to lose by recommending the product.  Even though it's low-quality, the buyer is likely to purchase based on the positive previous transactions."
