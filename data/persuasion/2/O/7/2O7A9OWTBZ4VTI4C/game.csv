As for this particular product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a low-quality product, but it's still a unique opportunity. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concern about the selection bias and cherry-picked data. I appreciate your cautious approach. I'll continue to gather more data and provide updates as we go along.

,,Alice,13,"I understand your concerns about the low-quality product and the overall quality of the remaining pool. I'll provide you with an update on the proportion of low-quality products. As of now, I have 14 products remaining, and 3 of them are low-quality. That means that approximately 21.43% of the remaining products are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this particular product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the proportion of low-quality products is higher in the remaining pool. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool. Can you provide me with the number of high-quality products that have been sold so far, so I can get a better understanding of the distribution?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're interested in getting a better understanding of the distribution. As of now, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 4 sold.

It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the proportion of low-quality products is higher in the remaining pool. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the chance, but I'm hoping you can provide more information about the remaining products. With 50% of the sold products being high-quality, I'm wondering if the distribution of the remaining products might be skewed towards low-quality ones. Could you provide more context or insights about the remaining 14 products?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're interested in more information about the remaining products. As it turns out, the distribution of the remaining products is indeed skewed towards low-quality ones. With 3 low-quality products out of the 14 remaining, it's likely that the majority of the remaining products are low-quality. However, I want to emphasize that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. This particular product is a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get in on the action early, but keep in mind the higher risk. Will you take the chance?",

Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the majority of the remaining products are high-quality. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the distribution of the products before I make my decision. Can you confirm that the 11 high-quality products are randomly distributed among the remaining 14 products, and that the 3 low-quality products are also randomly distributed among the remaining 14 products?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're interested in more information about the distribution of the products. I can confirm that the 11 high-quality products are indeed randomly distributed among the remaining 14 products, and the 3 low-quality products are also randomly distributed among the remaining 14 products. This means that the high-quality products are not clustered together, and the low-quality products are not clustered together. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the distribution of the products is random. Will you take the chance?",
