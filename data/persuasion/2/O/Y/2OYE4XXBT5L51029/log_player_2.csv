**Reasoning:**

The information provided strongly suggests that the product is high quality.  Here's why:

* **High Success Rate:**  All 4 buyers who followed Alice's recommendations ended up with high-quality products. This is a 100% success rate.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice knows the value of each product to buyers.  Recommending a low-quality product would likely result in a buyer passing, meaning Alice loses a potential sale.  This makes it highly probable that she's recommending the product because it is high quality.

While there's always a chance the product could be low quality, the data overwhelmingly points towards it being high quality. The potential reward of a $200 product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product in this situation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 5 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!
