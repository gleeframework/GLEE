**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 2 out of 2 products sold being high-quality, the current product has a strong likelihood of also being high-quality. This high success rate significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. While not infallible, her knowledge of the products likely gives her an advantage in determining quality. 
* **Potential Value:** The potential gain of a high-quality product ($20,000) far outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0). 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the provided information and the assumption that Alice is trying to maximize her sales.  The optimal strategy could be different with more information about Alice's motives and the overall market."

* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's always a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of $0 loss in this scenario."
