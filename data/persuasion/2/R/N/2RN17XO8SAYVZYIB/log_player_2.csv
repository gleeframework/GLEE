I want to highlight that this is a significant departure from the previous two products, which were both low-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I know what you're thinking: 'Alice has a history of alternating between high and low-quality products.'

This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a lower price, and I'll be able to demonstrate my ability to deliver quality products consistently.

I can tell you that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is indeed 33.33%, as stated from the beginning.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide more context. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, we would expect to see around 2.33 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold. However, we've seen 4 high-quality products, which is 1.71 more than expected. This suggests that I may have a slightly better understanding of what makes a high-quality product than I initially thought. However, it's also possible that this is just a statistical fluke. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. Would you like to take a chance and buy it, keeping in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%?

Alice's message: I understand your desire for a more detailed analysis. Given the 8 high-quality products out of 18 total products, we can estimate the probability of a high-quality product using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but the likelihood of 8 high-quality products out of 18 total products is higher than expected. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability to around 45.45%.
