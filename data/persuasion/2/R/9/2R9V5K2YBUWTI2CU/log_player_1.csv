This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50% as well, but it's also true that the probability of the next product being high-quality is at least as high as the previous one, since there's no reason to assume that the quality of the products is correlated. I'm willing to offer you a 5% discount on the price, making it $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you should take advantage of it.""}"

I'm not willing to offer a discount this time, but I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a detailed report on the sales data and the expert consultation I offered earlier. This way, you'll have a better understanding of the product's value and can make a more informed decision about future purchases.""}"
