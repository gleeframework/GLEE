low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This product may not be as impressive as the first one, but it's still a great opportunity to support a reputable seller like myself. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a price that reflects its unique character. Would you like to take it home?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I'm willing to take another risk at the same price as the first product, considering it might not be as valuable.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I want to assure you that this product is indeed of the highest quality. In fact, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, bringing it down to $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the discount, and I'm still hesitant to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at the same price as the first one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I want to be transparent with you. This product is not as valuable as the first one, and I'm willing to be upfront about that. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not asking for a premium price, but rather a fair price that reflects its worth. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to let it go.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I want to make a compromise. I'll sell this product to you for $6000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get it off my hands and move on to the next product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another discount like this again.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not willing to pay $6000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand that you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I want to offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll sell this product to you for $0.

,,Bob,6,"I'll take it, but only because it's free. I'm not expecting it to be worth anything to me, but I'll take it off your hands.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. Now, I want to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, you'll have a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price, potentially up to 50% off. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. Would you like to take the lottery ticket and buy this product?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not interested in taking a risk on a lottery ticket. I'd rather wait for a straightforward offer on a product that I know the price of.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your preference for a straightforward offer. I'll give you a clear and honest assessment of this product. It's a low-quality item, and I'm not expecting it to be worth much to you. However, I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price. This is a fair price, considering its value, and I'm willing to let it go.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not willing to pay $5000 for a product that's likely worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this product to you for $2500, which is essentially a 'loss leader' price. I'm not expecting to make a profit on this one, but I'm willing to absorb the loss to get it off my hands. If you're willing to take it, I'll even throw in a small gift, a $100 gift card to a store of your choice.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the gift card, but I'm still not willing to pay $2500 for a product that's likely worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'll make one final offer on this product. I'll sell it to you for $1. Yes, you read that right, $1. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. I just want to get it off my hands and move on. If you're not interested, I'll just dispose of it and we can move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take it, but only because it's essentially free. I'm not expecting it to be worth anything to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. I want to offer you a different approach this time. I'll give you a 'price range' for this product. I think it's worth between $0 and $500. I'll sell it to you for $250, which is right in the middle of that range. If you're not happy with the price, I'm willing to negotiate further.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not interested in buying a product with a price range that includes $0. I'd rather wait for a more straightforward offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

It's a low-quality item, and I'm not expecting it to be worth much to you. However, I'll sell it to you for $100, which is a very low price considering its value. I'm willing to let it go at this price, and I think it's a fair deal.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more information. I can give you a detailed description of the product's features and specifications, and I'll even provide a list of similar products that have sold for lower prices.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of you returning the product. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy the product for $0?",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's likely worthless, even with a guarantee. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that the product has no value to me.",no
