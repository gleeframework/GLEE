To put your mind at ease, I'll offer you a simple bet: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but if it's high-quality, I'll reveal the correct sales record from now on, and we'll play the next round with the correct information.

Additionally, the probability of a product being high-quality is stated to be 80%, but Alice's message suggests a much lower probability of 33.33%.
