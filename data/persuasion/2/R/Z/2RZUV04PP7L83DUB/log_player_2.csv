Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $200 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.
