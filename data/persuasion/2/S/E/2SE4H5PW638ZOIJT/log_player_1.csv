If I were selling high-quality products, I'd have sold at least 3-4 by now. I'm offering you a chance to get a potentially low-quality product for a steal. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I want to make sure you understand that I'm doing this because I think the odds are against you, and I'm taking a risk.

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the update on the sales data. However, I'm still cautious about the high proportion of low-quality products sold.

Would you like to take a chance on getting a $300 product for $100?""
}"
