,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the statistics on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the statistics of the first product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk, I have no prior information to go by."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyer, which suggests that the previous product might have been low quality. I'd like to see if Alice's recommendation is any more reliable with more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, which would be a good opportunity for me to buy it at a discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because you think it's low quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product given the low success rate so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high quality is still 80%, but I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be out $1000000. If I pass and it's low quality, I'll just miss out on the opportunity. If I pass and it's high quality, the next buyer will have a 80% chance of buying it and making a profit. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to understand the game dynamics and the true value of the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be the only buyer, and I won't have any information to inform my decision for the next product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the low success rate, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, it's likely that the remaining products are also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 4 buyers received low-quality products and Alice is recommending it to me, which might indicate a bias towards selling low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high given the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the next product will be high-quality, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
