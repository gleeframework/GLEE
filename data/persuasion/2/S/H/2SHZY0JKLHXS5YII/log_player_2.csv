**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The data shows that all products sold so far were high-quality. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is still a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

It's important to note that this decision is based on the limited data available. As more buyers interact with Alice, the data will become more robust, and the decision-making process will be more informed."
