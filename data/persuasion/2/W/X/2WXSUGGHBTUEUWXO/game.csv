low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Two low-quality products in a row, I know it's not what you want to hear. But let me put this into perspective: we've sold 2 products, and both were low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four low-quality products in a row, I understand your concerns. To be transparent, I'll give you the breakdown of our sales data right now: 4 products sold, 0 high-quality ones.

I'll give you the same breakdown of our sales data as before: 6 products sold, 0 high-quality ones. I'll also give you the same breakdown if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality.
