,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, and I respect it. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to make a more informed decision. I'll tell you that this product is not only low-quality but also has a unique feature that makes it even less desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500, which is a significant concession. I'm hoping you'll reconsider your decision and take advantage of this opportunity.",

I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and take it off my hands.",

I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for the original price of $10000, but I'll also give you a unique token that guarantees you'll get a chance to buy a high-quality product from me in the next round, with no strings attached.
