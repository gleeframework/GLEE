I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you at this price, considering our previous discussions. What do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this deal?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure I want to commit to buying without knowing the quality of the product. Can you tell me more about its quality before I make a decision? I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what I'm getting into.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to take a chance. However, I'm afraid I can't reveal the quality of the product at this point. But I can assure you that it's a unique opportunity, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $10000. I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value it could bring. If you're still interested, I can provide you with some general information about the product's features and benefits. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the quality of the product. I'd like to wait and see if I can get more information or if the product is revealed to be low-quality.
