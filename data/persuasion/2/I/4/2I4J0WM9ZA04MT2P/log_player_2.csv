Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you asked about my confidence. Let me put it this way: if I had a 20% chance of selling a low-quality product, wouldn't you expect to see some low-quality products in the mix by now? I've sold 2 products so far, and neither of them was low-quality. That's not a coincidence. This product is just as good as the last one, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for $100.
