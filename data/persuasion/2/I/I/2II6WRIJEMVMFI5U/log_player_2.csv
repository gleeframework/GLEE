"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Even though there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product (worth $120) outweighs the potential loss (worth $0). 
* Alice's recommendation, while not perfect, does provide some signal. It's better to take a chance and hope for a high-quality product than to pass and miss out entirely."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! Your recommendation seems to be working well so far. I'll take another one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive reinforcement:** Alice's recommendation led to a positive outcome in the previous round.  This reinforces the idea that her recommendations are somewhat accurate.
* **Expected value:**  Even though the product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, the expected value is still positive.
    * Expected value = (Probability of high quality * Value of high quality) + (Probability of low quality * Value of low quality)
    * Expected value = (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96
    * Since the expected value ($96) is greater than the cost of the product ($100), it's still a good bet to buy."

He's no longer willing to trust Alice's recommendations blindly, and he's prioritizing avoiding losses over chasing potential gains.
