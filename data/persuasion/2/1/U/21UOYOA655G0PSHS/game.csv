,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced that the success rate is high enough to justify the purchase, especially since I don't know what the product is worth to me. Can I get a refund of my $100 if I pass, or will it be lost?",no

That's a pretty good track record, don't you think? And remember, there's no refund policy, so you'll be taking a calculated risk. But for $100, you might just get a rare gem. What do you say? Will you take a chance?",
