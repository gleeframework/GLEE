Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in our product. You know that the first product sold was high-quality, but that doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be. In fact, I've sold a total of 1 product so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 100% success rate for high-quality products, but it's just a small sample size. I'm offering this one to you for $100. What do you think?

If I were to do this without that information, I would have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is not worth the $100 to me. However, given the 100% success rate in this small sample size, I'm willing to take the risk.""

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right to consider the sample size and the initial success rate. I'll give you a bit more context: I've now sold a total of 2 products, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is still a bit higher than the expected 33.33%. I'm still offering this one to you for $100. What do you think?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're considering our product. You know that the first two products were not high-quality, but the third one was. Now, I've sold a total of 3 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 33.33% success rate, which is back in line with my average.

As for the chances of the next buyer getting a high-quality product, it's still 33.33%, since the probability doesn't change based on the previous sales. However, I want to point out that I've now sold a total of 4 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is higher than the expected rate.
