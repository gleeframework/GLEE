Unfortunately, the product I have available now is not as good as the first one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I think it could still be a good value for the price.""

}"
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the transparency and the special deal. However, with no prior sales data to go on, I'm hesitant to risk $1000000 on a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'll pass on this one, but I'm interested in seeing how your future sales go. If you manage to sell a few high-quality products in a row, I might be more inclined to make a purchase.

"The buyer's message: Alice, while your track record is improving, it's still not enough to convince me.  A 44.44% chance of getting a high-quality product isn't enough to justify the risk.  I'm going to pass for now, but thanks for the offer.
