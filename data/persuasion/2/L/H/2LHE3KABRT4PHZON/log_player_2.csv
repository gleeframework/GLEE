Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to assure you that I've sold many items before, and I've had a good track record of selling high-quality products. In fact, out of my last 2 sales, 1 was high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%.

Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I'd like to point out that the statistics are not as favorable as they seem. Out of my 4 sales, 3 were high-quality, which is an unusually high proportion. This might be a sign that I've been selling a lot of high-quality products in a row, but it could also be a sign that I'm just getting lucky.
