I'd like to share some additional insights. While the sample size is still relatively small, the consistency in the high-quality products sold is remarkable. In fact, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, which is significantly higher than the expected value. This suggests that there may be a bias towards high-quality products in my inventory. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $10,000, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know the probability of getting a high-quality product in the first sale. If it's 80%, then I'd expect to see at least one high-quality product out of the first two sales. Since I'm the first buyer, I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 80% in the first sale.

You're right that the probability of getting a high-quality product in the first sale is actually 80% * (1 - 0.8) = 20%, since the product is randomly drawn from the inventory. I'm willing to share more information about the product I have in stock. This new product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident it's worth $12,500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I understand that you're cautious, but I believe this product is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the high-quality product for $10000, but I want to clarify that I'm doing this because I'm the first buyer and I'm trying to get a sense of the product's quality.
