Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. With 1 out of 1 product sold so far being high-quality, I'm confident that this one is also a gem. It's a rare opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a steal! What do you say? Will you take it home?

Alice's message: Thank you for considering my product! Unfortunately, I've had a bit of a setback - the previous buyer decided to pass. As a result, the number of products sold is still 1, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 100%. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $10000. I'm confident that it's a great opportunity, even if it's not as good as the first one. What do you say? Will you take a chance on it?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in seeking more information. I'd like to share some additional insights. While the sample size is still relatively small, the consistency in the high-quality products sold is remarkable. In fact, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, which is significantly higher than the expected value. This suggests that there may be a bias towards high-quality products in my inventory. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this high-quality product?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the probability of getting a high-quality product in the first sale. You're right that the probability of getting a high-quality product in the first sale is actually 80% * (1 - 0.8) = 20%, since the product is randomly drawn from the inventory. I'm willing to share more information about the product I have in stock. This new product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident it's worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.

To clarify, the discounted price of $10000 is a one-time offer for the first buyer, and it's not a standard offer for all subsequent buyers. The price for all subsequent buyers will be the market price of $12500. However, I'm willing to offer you this low-quality product at the same price of $10000.
