,,Alice,5,"You're now seeing the third low-quality product in a row. I want to be transparent with you about the sales data: 3 high-quality products out of 5 sold, which is a higher ratio than expected. However, I also want to point out that the law of large numbers might be catching up, and the next product might not be as likely to be high-quality. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to give you the opportunity to reconsider based on the updated information.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the detailed information, Alice. Given the recent trend and the law of large numbers, I am choosing not to purchase this product.",no

However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product: I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'll also throw in a free inspection report that will give you detailed information about the product's quality and any potential issues.

I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll also offer you a discount of $2000 if you're willing to buy it.
