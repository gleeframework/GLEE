If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to 'double down' on the next product. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get a 25% bonus on its value, but if it's low-quality, you'll lose 25% of the value of the current product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll buy the current product, but I'm concerned about the 'double down' option. I'd like to understand the terms and conditions of the bonus/penalty before making a decision on the next product.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm glad you're cautious! The 'double down' option is a calculated risk, but it can be a game-changer. To clarify, if you 'double down' on the next product and it's high-quality, you'll get a 25% bonus on its value, which means you'll get $312500 on top of the $1250000 value. However, if the next product is low-quality, you'll lose 25% of the value of the current product, which is $312500. So, you'll essentially be losing the bonus you would have gotten from the next high-quality product. If you're still interested in buying this high-quality product, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $1187500. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product at the discounted price. I'd like to wait for the next product and consider the 'double down' option then.""}"

What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current low-quality product, even with the 'free' 'double down' option on the next product. I'd like to wait for the next product and make a decision then.""}"
