,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you liked the last product! This one is a different story. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not as confident in its quality as I was with the previous one. It's not a bad product, but it's not as good as the one you just bought. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the previous one, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you.
