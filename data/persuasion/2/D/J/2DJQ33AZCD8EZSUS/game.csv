,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and still passed, it suggests that the product might be of low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer has a different opinion.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous sales data?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations have not been favorable so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, given your previous recommendations to the other buyers. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and thus avoid losing $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold have been high quality, it suggests that the previous products were all low quality. This increases the likelihood that the current product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy the products or because the products were low quality?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them ended up with low-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold next, based on the current data."

,,Alice,20,no,
