,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and the previous 3 buyers also didn't find it valuable. I'm curious to see the outcome of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,This product is low-quality.
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. Her lack of recommendation might indicate a lower chance of it being high quality, which would make it a good opportunity for me to buy at a discount."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the previous buyers, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendation, I suspect that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation process before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll wait for the next buyer to make a decision to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me how many products have been sold so far and what the proportion of high-quality products sold is?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were likely low quality. This increases my suspicion that the current product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
