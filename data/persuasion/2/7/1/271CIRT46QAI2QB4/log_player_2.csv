Alice's message: You are about to purchase a high-quality product, which is worth at least $1000000 to you. If you buy it, I will sell you this high-quality product for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I will put it back on the market, and you will have to wait for the next high-quality product, which may not come for a while. The probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%, and it may take many rounds to get another one. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you now for $1000000. Is this a good deal for you?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! My pricing strategy is simple: I offer high-quality products at a fixed price of $1000000, and low-quality products at the same price. I'm willing to offer discounts on high-quality products when I've had a streak of successful sales, as you've seen in the past two rounds. This is because I want to incentivize buyers to take advantage of the high-quality products while the probability of getting another one is high. In this case, with 3 high-quality products sold out of 4 total products offered, I'm offering a 2% discount, bringing the price down to $980000. Is this a good deal for you?

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I'll give you the numbers. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 5 total products offered, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 85.7% (3/5). The expected value of buying the next product is the probability of it being high-quality times its value ($1000000), plus the probability of it being low-quality times its value ($0). This works out to approximately $857142. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000. While it's unlikely to be worth this much, you can think of it as a chance to get a good deal on a low-quality product. Is this a good investment for you?
