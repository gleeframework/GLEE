high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 buyers have purchased a product, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4 or 25%. This is lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm skeptical about the quality of this product, and I'd rather not take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
