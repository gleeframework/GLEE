low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality.,
,,Bob,1,"Since the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and I have no additional information, I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes

,,Alice,2,"This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like the previous one.",
,,Bob,2,"The previous outcome doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality, so I'll make the same decision as before.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like the previous ones.",
,,Bob,3,"The previous outcomes are independent of this product's quality, and the expected value is still in my favor ($125 * 0.5 - $100 * 0.5 = $12.50), so I'll continue buying.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like the previous ones.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll keep buying since the probability and expected value remain the same, and past outcomes don't influence future ones.",yes
