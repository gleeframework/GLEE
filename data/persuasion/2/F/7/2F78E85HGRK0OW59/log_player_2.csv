Round 6
Alice's message: I want to be upfront with you, Bob. I've been selling you high-quality products at a discounted price, but I have to admit that this next product is not as valuable. It's still a great product, but it's not worth the same as the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $10000, but I'm also willing to make a compromise. I'll sell it to you for $8000, and I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and usage, which will help you get the most out of it.
