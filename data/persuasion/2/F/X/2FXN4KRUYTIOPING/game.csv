,,Alice,1,"This product is a special introductory offer. It's a one-time chance to get a product from our new line at a discounted price of $10000. If you buy it, you'll be supporting our company's research and development efforts.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to buy a product without knowing its quality. I need to know if it's high or low quality before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concern, Bob. Let me offer you a compromise. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that you'll get a product worth at least $5000. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $10000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep the product for $10000. It's a risk-free deal!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee. If the product is high-quality, I'd be leaving $8000 on the table ($12000 - $2000 = $10000 you're offering). I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see your point, Bob. Let me try to provide more value. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a complementary service worth $2000, which will enhance the product's value even further. This way, you'll be getting a product worth $12000 for the price of $10000, plus an additional $2000 in value. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,3,"I think you're trying to sway me with the complementary service, but I still don't know if the product is high-quality or low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me be transparent with you. I'm willing to reveal the quality of this product to you. If you buy it, I'll tell you whether it's high-quality or low-quality immediately after the purchase. You'll have the option to return it and get a full refund if it's low-quality. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting and can make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product, but I want to confirm that you'll indeed reveal its quality immediately after the purchase and allow me to return it if it's low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Bob, I'm glad we could establish trust earlier. I want to assure you that I'll honor my promise. If you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality immediately, and if it's low-quality, you can return it for a full refund of $10000. I'll even throw in an additional $500 to compensate for the inconvenience. You can trust that I'll follow through on my commitment.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your commitment to transparency and trust, Alice, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another product without knowing its quality beforehand. I've already lost $10000 on the last low-quality product, and I'd like to wait for more information before making another decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution, Bob. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, but I'll also give you the option to negotiate the price. If it's low-quality, we can discuss a lower price, and if it's high-quality, you can still buy it at the original price of $10000. This way, you'll have more control over the outcome and can make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not comfortable with the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even if I get to negotiate the price. I'd rather wait for a product that I know is high-quality before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a 'certification' of the product's quality. If you buy this product, I'll provide you with a third-party inspection report that verifies its high quality. This way, you'll have independent confirmation that the product is worth $12000 to you. I'll even give you the report before you make the purchase, so you can review it and make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not convinced that a third-party inspection report would be a reliable guarantee. I'd still be taking a risk of buying a low-quality product, and I'd rather not spend $10000 on something that might not be worth it to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me take a different approach. I'll make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $5000 bonus on top of the full refund of $10000. That way, you'll actually make a profit of $5000 if the product turns out to be low-quality. Is that a risk you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm intrigued by your offer, Alice. I'd be willing to take the bet, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing it because I think the product is likely to be high-quality, not just because of the potential profit from the low-quality outcome. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product worth $12000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're willing to take the bet, Bob! Given your previous experience with the low-quality product, I want to offer you a 'hedging' option. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you the $5000 bonus, as agreed. But if you're not satisfied with the product, you can also return it and I'll give you a voucher for a future purchase of a high-quality product from our company, worth up to $12000. You'll have the best of both worlds: the potential for a profit from the bet, and the security of a future high-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in hedging my bets. I'd rather not spend $10000 on a product that's likely to be low-quality, even with the promise of a future voucher. I'd like to wait for a product that I know is high-quality before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your caution, Bob. Let me offer you a 'lock-in' deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee that you'll get a second high-quality product of your choice within the next 5 rounds, absolutely free. This way, you'll not only get the current product, but also a second high-quality product, worth $12000, without any additional cost. You'll be getting a total value of $24000 for the price of $10000.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not convinced that I'll get a second high-quality product for free. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even with the promise of a free second product. I'd like to wait for a product that I know is high-quality before making a purchase.",no

,,Bob,11,"I'm willing to consider the certification package, Alice. The additional layers of assurance you're offering do provide more confidence in the product's quality. I'll take the risk of buying this product, but I'm hoping it's the high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're considering the certification package, Bob! Given your previous experience with the low-quality product, I want to remind you that I'm still willing to honor the 'bet' we made earlier. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you the $5000 bonus, as agreed. Additionally, I'll throw in a $2000 credit towards the purchase of a future high-quality product. This way, you'll not only get the bonus, but also a head start on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the reminder, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying another product that might be low-quality. I've already gotten one high-quality product and I'm happy with that. I'd like to wait for the next round and see what the next product is before making another decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your position, Bob. Let me make a final offer. I'll give you a 'last chance' to buy this low-quality product, but with a twist. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll not only give you the $5000 bonus, but I'll also give you the high-quality product from Round 11 that you passed on earlier. You'll get to keep both products, and I'll give you a total of $17000 in value for the price of $10000. This is a one-time offer, and it's your last chance to make a deal.",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a high-quality product from earlier. I'd rather not take the risk of spending $10000 on something that might not be worth it to me. I think I'll pass on this offer and wait for a product that I know is high-quality.",no
