,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product in the future, and a 50% chance of selling a low-quality product. I'm starting with a low-quality product, so you're essentially taking a risk by buying this one. If you're interested, I can offer you a deal, but if you're not, I can move on to the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it. I'm willing to take the risk of a low-quality product, but I'm hoping it's high quality. I'll pay the $1000000 as agreed.",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I'm glad you're interested. I want to remind you that I sold the previous product to a buyer, and now I'm offering a high-quality product. This means that the probability of me selling a high-quality product is now 50%, but the probability of selling a low-quality product is 0% for this specific product, since we've already sold a low-quality product. Given this information, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at the same price as the previous one.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your claim that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% for this specific product. Since you've already sold a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this opportunity and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right to be cautious. I'm willing to be transparent with you: since I've already sold one low-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 66.67% (2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold). I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to get a good deal on a low-quality product, and who knows, you might even get lucky and get a high-quality product next time!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm interested in buying the next product if it's high-quality. Can you give me a better deal on the next one if it's high-quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I can offer you a deal on this low-quality product: if you buy it, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you get a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This means if the next product is high-quality, you'll get it for $900000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get it for $900000 as well. You'll essentially be getting a low-quality product for a 'discounted' price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,I'm not interested in the 'golden ticket' deal. I'd like to see the product before making a decision. Can I just buy the product at the listed price of $1000000?,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the next product! I'm glad you're interested. As you know, I've sold two low-quality products and one high-quality product so far. This means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 66.67% (2 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold). I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next product, which means you'll get to see the product before anyone else and have a chance to buy it at the listed price of $1000000, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product and the priority pass, but I'm only paying $500000. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, but I'm hoping it's high quality and the priority pass will give me an edge for the next product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations to the buyer who just purchased the high-quality product! As a result, I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products. This means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 85.71% (3 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold). I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll offer you an even sweeter deal: I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option, where you can buy this high-quality product for $750000, and I'll also throw in the same priority pass as before, giving you an edge for the next product. What do you say?",

You'll essentially be getting a 'free' $500000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it for the full $1000000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll do it only if it's actually high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll take the refund and pass on the product.",yes

If you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, you'll get it for $500000. What do you say?",

This is your last chance to get a low-quality product at a 'discounted' price, so what do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at the listed price, and I'm not sure I want to take the 'last chance' deal either. Can I get a better deal on the next product, or can I pass on both?",no
