However, I should also consider the possibility that the buyers in the previous rounds might have been overpaying, and the true value of the product is lower. To mitigate this risk, I'll send a message to the buyer to try to gauge their willingness to pay.

Given that I have no information about the value of low-quality products to the buyers, and considering the previous buyers have consistently valued high-quality products at least $10,000, I'll take a cautious approach and not recommend the buyer to buy the low-quality product.
