Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $3000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 66.67% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer. Will you take it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I should take the risk of buying a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, even at a discounted price.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to report that the second product is also high-quality. This is now 2 out of 2 high-quality products. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the data suggests a slightly higher likelihood. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: Unfortunately, the previous buyer got a low-quality product, despite the high-quality streak. This is a reminder that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'd like to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you, and the products are randomly selected. I'll sell this product to you for $1000000.
