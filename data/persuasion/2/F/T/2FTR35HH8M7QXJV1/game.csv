,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that only 1 out of the first buyer purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33% and the recommendation from Alice might be biased. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
