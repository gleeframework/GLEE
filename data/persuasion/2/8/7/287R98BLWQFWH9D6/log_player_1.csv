"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600. 
* **Profit:**  Since the product costs $10,000, Bob is expected to lose $400 on average. However, the potential gain of $2,000 if the product is high-quality is significant.
* **Risk Aversion:**  The decision depends on Bob's risk aversion. If Bob is risk-neutral or slightly risk-tolerant, the potential gain outweighs the risk of losing money. 

**Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is a reasonable decision, even though there is a risk involved.**"
