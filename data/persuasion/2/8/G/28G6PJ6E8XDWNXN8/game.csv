,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, I have no prior information to make an informed decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm not convinced by the lack of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous 3 buyers were all recommended to pass, which means they must have seen 3 low-quality products in a row. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the probability of 3 low-quality products in a row is (2/3)^(3) = 8/27. This is less than 1/4, so I'm taking a chance that the next product will be high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of the first 4, and the fact that you're recommending me to buy it. This suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for another product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and 4 previous buyers also chose not to buy, I'm inclined to think it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if the low-quality product ratio is higher than 66.67% or if the previous buyers were just unlucky."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that you haven't recommended a product to anyone who's bought it so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,19,yes,
