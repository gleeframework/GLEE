This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has consistently opted to only buy products Alice explicitly recommends, and this round's product is high-quality, it's time to break the pattern.  Bob has shown a strong trust in Alice's judgment and is clearly looking for opportunities to buy high-quality products.  Recommending this final product, despite Bob's current strategy, allows Alice to demonstrate the value she brings to the table and potentially encourage future purchases.

Here's why it's a good idea to recommend the purchase:

* **Building Trust:** By recommending a product that's known to be valuable to Bob, Alice can further solidify the trust that has been built throughout the game. 
* **Demonstrating Value:** Bob has repeatedly shown his willingness to trust Alice's judgment and follow her lead. This recommendation provides a concrete example of how Alice's advice leads to positive outcomes.
* **Encouraging Future Purchases:** Even though Bob has been hesitant to buy products that aren't explicitly recommended, this final recommendation could change his perception and make him more open to buying future products, even without a direct recommendation. 

By taking this calculated risk and making this final recommendation, Alice can potentially build a stronger relationship with Bob and lay the foundation for a more fruitful partnership in the future."
