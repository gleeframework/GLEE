``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is high quality. This adds information.
* **Previous Sale:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one total sale strengthens the belief that the current product is also likely high quality.  

**Conclusion:** While there is still a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the information available significantly increases the likelihood of it being high quality, making it a good buy."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which indicates she likely believes the product is high quality. 
* **Previous sales:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This strongly suggests Alice is able to identify high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($12,500) while the potential loss is limited ($10,000).

Given these factors, the risk of buying seems low compared to the potential reward."
