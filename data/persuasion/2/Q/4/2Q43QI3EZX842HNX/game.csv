,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. Let me put it this way: I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence. The odds are still 50/50, and I'm not guaranteeing anything. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you have this product for $10000. But if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I completely understand.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to give me another chance. To be honest, I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, followed by 1 low-quality product. It's possible that the streak was just a coincidence, and the quality of my products is still 50/50. If you're willing to take another chance, I'll let you have this product for $10000.
