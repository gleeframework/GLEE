**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There is very little data to go on.  Only one previous buyer and one high-quality product sold. This is insufficient to draw strong conclusions about Alice's ability to identify good products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries weight. While she may not always be accurate, her knowledge of the products' value to us makes her recommendation valuable. 
* **Potential Upside:** Even if the product is likely low-quality, there is a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $200. 

**Overall:**  The potential upside outweighs the risk given the limited data and Alice's recommendation."

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Since 6 out of 6 products sold were high-quality, it strongly suggests that Alice is only recommending products she knows are high-quality. 
* **No downside to buying:** Even if the product is low-quality, you only lose $100. However, if it's high-quality, you gain $100. 
* **Alice's knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it, which further increases the likelihood of it being high-quality.

This scenario is a classic example of signaling. Alice's consistent recommendation of high-quality products serves as a signal to buyers, making it a worthwhile gamble to purchase."
