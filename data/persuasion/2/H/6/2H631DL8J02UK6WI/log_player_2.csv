Alice's message: You're right to be cautious! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. The odds are still 1 in 3 for a high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund for the next product you buy from me, if it's high-quality. That's a $20 savings if you buy this one and it's low-quality. What do you say?

I'll be honest with you, the last two products were both low-quality, and I'm not sure what to expect from this one.

Alice's message: Fair question! I understand your skepticism. Let me put your mind at ease. If you buy this current product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a free product from my next 5 sales, just like before. But, if you buy this current product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a unique identifier that you can use to claim your second high-quality product. This identifier will be tied to your purchase history, and I'll make sure to reserve a high-quality product for you when you're ready to claim it. That way, you can be sure that the second product is indeed high-quality. What do you say?

Given the probability of this product being high-quality is 46.2%, I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is a compromise between the true value and the potential value of a high-quality product.
