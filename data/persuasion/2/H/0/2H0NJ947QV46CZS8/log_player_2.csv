Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer who's doing your research. I respect that. You're right that the previous buyer's purchase of a high-quality product may have skewed the statistics.

This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 37.5% (3/8, considering the 2 sales). But I'd like to point out that the 2 buyers who purchased products have shown that they're willing to take a chance on our products. This one, being a low-quality product, is a chance for you to get a unique item at a fixed price of $1000000. It's a risk, but it might just pay off.
