Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to lower the price or offer a guarantee. However, I can give you some context: I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I've sold 1 low-quality product so far. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm confident that you'll be happy with the product, and I'm offering a great deal at $100. It's a one-time offer, so you'll have to decide now or walk away.
