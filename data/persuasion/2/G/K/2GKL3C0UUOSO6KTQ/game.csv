low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality. Can you tell me more about this product, or at least share the probability of it being high quality based on the data so far? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your past recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products Alice has been offering might be of low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products so far, and none of them were high-quality. Given the equal probability of high and low-quality products, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of it being high quality, and I'm hoping to be the first to buy a high-quality product. I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk of being low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product I'll get is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm going to assume the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. Given that I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'd like to pass on this one to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product since none of the previous 4 buyers were able to get a high-quality one. I'll pass on it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are likely low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being recommended to a buyer is 25% (50% chance of high-quality product * 50% chance of being recommended), so I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
