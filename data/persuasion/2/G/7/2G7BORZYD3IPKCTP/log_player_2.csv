**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which means she knows the product is high quality. 
* **Sales data:**  The sales data shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products.
* **Value proposition:**  Even with the 50/50 chance, the potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

Therefore, buying the product is the best decision in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's track record:**  Alice has recommended 8 products and all of them were high quality. This indicates a 100% success rate for her recommendations.
* **The odds:** Even though there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, Alice's perfect track record provides strong evidence that the current product is likely high quality.
* **The potential payoff:** If the product is high quality, you'll make a profit of $2,500 ($12,500 value - $10,000 price). The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward and Alice's perfect recommendation history."
