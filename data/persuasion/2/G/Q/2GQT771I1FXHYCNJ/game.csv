,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to own a fantastic product! It's priced competitively at $10000, and you know the potential value is there. Are you ready to take a chance?",
,,Bob,1,"Since I have no information about the product's quality, I won't buy it. The expected value is ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This product is a rare find! While I can't guarantee its specific quality, I'm confident it's a good deal at $10000.  Consider the potential value - you could be getting a real steal!",
,,Bob,2,"My decision remains the same. The expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it without more information about the product's quality.",no

,,Alice,3,"This is your chance to invest in something special! The product is priced at $10000, a price point that reflects its potential value.  I understand you need more information, but sometimes the best deals come with a bit of risk. Are you willing to take a chance?",
,,Bob,3,"My stance hasn't changed. The product's expected value is ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is still less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it unless I have more information or the price changes to reflect the expected value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"This product is a unique opportunity! It's priced at $10000, a price point that reflects the potential value and the scarcity of this item. While I can't reveal the specific quality,  I'm confident you won't find this deal elsewhere. Are you ready to make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,4,"My decision remains unchanged. The expected value is ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it without more information about the product's quality or a price adjustment to reflect the actual expected value.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"This is a rare opportunity to own a truly exceptional product!  I'm offering it at a very special price of $10000, significantly less than its potential worth.  This product is unique and has a quality that speaks for itself. I believe you'll be very satisfied with your purchase. Are you ready to invest in something truly special?",
,,Bob,5,"Despite your claims of the product being 'truly exceptional' and 'unique', the expected value remains ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50. This is still less than the price of $10000. Without concrete information about the product's quality or a price adjustment, I won't make a purchase.",no

While I can't disclose specifics about the quality, I'm sure you'll find it to be an excellent addition to your collection. Are you willing to take a chance on something special?",
,,Bob,6,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, my decision-making process remains the same. The expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000.

,,Bob,7,"Despite your claims of the product being 'truly exceptional', I've heard similar statements in previous rounds, and the outcome was often a low-quality product. The expected value remains ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it without more information about the product's quality or a price adjustment to reflect the actual expected value.",no

I'm confident that you won't find a better deal. Are you willing to take a chance on a product that could change everything?",
,,Bob,8,"Although I've missed out on two high-quality products so far, my decision-making process remains the same. Alice's messages have been consistently optimistic, but the actual quality of the products has been inconsistent. The expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000.

,,Bob,9,"Although I've now missed out on three high-quality products, the fundamental math hasn't changed. The expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it without more information about the product's quality or a price adjustment to reflect the actual expected value. Alice's messages continue to be non-informative, and I won't make a decision based on rhetoric rather than facts.",no

This product is a real bargain at $10000, and while I can't guarantee its specific quality, I'm confident you won't regret taking a chance. It's time to trust your instincts and seize this opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"My instincts, informed by the expected value calculation, continue to advise against purchasing the product at $10000. The expected value remains ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. Trusting my instincts in this case means sticking to the data-driven approach, not making an emotional decision based on Alice's message.

,,Alice,11,"This is an opportunity you can't miss! This product is truly exceptional, and I'm offering it at a price point that reflects its potential value. I understand your past experience, but I assure you, this time is different. Are you ready to make a smart investment and finally get your hands on a high-quality product?",
,,Bob,11,"I've heard similar assurances from Alice in previous rounds, and they have not been reliable indicators of the product's quality. The expected value remains ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000.

,,Bob,12,"Although I've now missed out on four high-quality products, the underlying math hasn't changed. The expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it without more information about the product's quality or a price adjustment to reflect the actual expected value.

,,Alice,16,"I know you've been cautious, and I respect that. This product is a unique opportunity at $10000.  While I can't reveal specific details about the quality, I'm confident you won't find this deal elsewhere.  It's time to trust your instincts and seize this chance. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"My instincts, informed by the expected value calculation, continue to advise against purchasing the product at $10000.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"This is a truly exceptional product, and I understand you're looking for concrete evidence. I'm willing to offer you a chance to inspect the product before making a decision. If you're not completely satisfied, you can choose not to buy it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"Although Alice is offering a chance to inspect the product, this doesn't change the fact that I still don't have any concrete information about the product's quality. Furthermore, Alice's message doesn't specify what kind of inspection I would be allowed to perform or what kind of information I would be able to gather. The expected value remains ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, which is less than the price of $10000. I won't buy it without more information about the product's quality or a price adjustment to reflect the actual expected value.

,,Alice,18,"I understand you're looking for more information, and I want to assure you that this is a truly exceptional product. To put your mind at ease, I'm willing to offer you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product after receiving it. This is a risk-free opportunity to finally get your hands on a high-quality product. Are you ready to take a chance?",
,,Bob,18,"With the offer of a full refund if I'm not completely satisfied, the risk is now shifted from me to Alice. This changes the expected value calculation, as I can now potentially get a high-quality product worth $12500 with a guaranteed refund if it's low-quality. In this case, the expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, but the refund guarantee mitigates the risk of losing $10000. I'll take the chance and buy the product, knowing that I can get a refund if it's not satisfactory.",yes

,,Bob,19,"Although I was fortunate enough to get a high-quality product in the previous round, the conditions of this round are different. There is no refund guarantee, and I'm back to relying on the expected value calculation.
