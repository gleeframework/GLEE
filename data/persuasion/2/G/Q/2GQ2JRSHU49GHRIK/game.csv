low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it, and only one high-quality product has been sold so far, which is a relatively low proportion of the total number of products sold. This suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low, so I'd rather not take the risk."
