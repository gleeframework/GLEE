"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, and it's worth $2,000,000 if high quality and $0 if low quality, the expected value of buying is:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

This is equal to the price Alice is selling it for.  Therefore, it's a neutral decision.  Since Alice is recommending it, there's a slight chance she has some inside information, so it's worth taking the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your recommendation, Alice!  I'll take a chance on this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Round:** We learned that Alice's recommendations can be valuable as she correctly predicted a high-quality product in the previous round.
* **Current Round:**  Again, the expected value of buying is $1,000,000 (same as the price). However, considering Alice's potential insight, taking the risk again seems worthwhile."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations are spot on!  I'm confident in your judgement and will purchase this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Past Performance:**  Alice has correctly predicted two high-quality products in a row. This strongly suggests she might have some way of knowing the quality of the products, or at least a better than 50% chance of guessing correctly.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains $1,000,000, which is equal to the price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Based on Alice's past accuracy, the risk of buying a low-quality product seems significantly outweighed by the potential reward of another high-quality item."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised you're not recommending this one.  Since you've been so accurate, I'm hesitant to buy without your advice. I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Change:** Alice has switched from recommending to not recommending.  This is a significant change in her pattern, making it less likely that she knows the quality of this particular product. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains $1,000,000, which is equal to the price. However, Alice's previous accuracy has created an expectation that she might have information. This expectation is now gone.
* **Caution:**  It's better to be cautious in this situation. Without Alice's recommendation, the odds are essentially back to 50/50.  Passing allows us to avoid potentially losing money on a low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still a bit wary after the last round.  I'll pass on this one as well. Perhaps you'll have a better recommendation next time.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confirmation Bias:** Alice's lack of recommendation in the previous round was validated by the product being low quality. This reinforces the idea that her recommendations are valuable, and her lack of one indicates a potential risk.
* **Consistency:**  Alice continues to not recommend this product. This pattern strengthens the idea that she might have information, and her lack of recommendation is significant.
* **Risk Aversion:** With two consecutive rounds of no recommendation, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product feels higher than the potential reward of a high-quality one.  It's wiser to pass and wait for a more favorable situation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've surprised me before, but your past accuracy makes me think you might have something special here. I'm willing to take a chance and buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Shift:** Alice has switched back to recommending the product. This suggests a possible change in the quality of products being offered, or it could be a genuine shift in her knowledge.
* **Previous Pattern:** While Alice's lack of recommendation was accurate in the last two rounds, her previous consistent recommendations were also accurate. This creates a sense of uncertainty.
* **Calculated Risk:**  The expected value of buying is still $1,000,000, and while there's a risk of a low-quality product, Alice's potential insight makes taking this calculated risk appealing. The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the caution from the previous rounds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'm confident in your judgement and will buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Consistent Success:** Alice has correctly predicted the quality of the last three products, including the most recent one. This pattern strongly suggests she has some way of knowing the quality of the products, or at least a significantly higher than 50% chance of guessing correctly.
* **Expected Value:** As always, the expected value of buying is $1,000,000, which is equal to the price. However, Alice's track record makes the potential reward of a high-quality product seem much more likely.
* **Trust in Alice:**  Given Alice's consistent accuracy, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product feels significantly outweighed by the potential reward of another high-quality item. It's a wise decision to trust Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation track record has been fantastic.  But this sudden change makes me think you might not have information on this particular product.  I'll pass for now and see what you recommend next.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Pattern Shift:** Alice has switched back to not recommending the product. This is a significant change in her pattern, making it less likely that she knows the quality of this particular product. 
* **Previous Accuracy:**  While Alice's track record has been incredibly good, this change in her pattern raises doubts about whether she has information about this specific product.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Without Alice's recommendation, the odds are essentially back to 50/50. Passing allows us to avoid potentially losing money on a low-quality product, especially considering Alice's recent consistent accuracy makes her lack of recommendation seem more significant."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Reliability:** Despite the previous round's non-recommendation being correct, Alice has consistently demonstrated an ability to accurately predict the quality of products. This suggests she might have some genuine insight or a strong understanding of the patterns involved.
* **Pattern Reversal:** Alice's recommendation after a period of not recommending is intriguing. It could indicate a shift in the quality of products being offered or a renewed confidence in her ability to assess the current product.
* **Calculated Risk:** The expected value of buying remains $1,000,000, and while there's a risk of a low-quality product, Alice's track record makes the potential reward of a high-quality product seem more likely. Trusting her judgment and taking this calculated risk seems worthwhile."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Consistent Success:**  Alice has now correctly predicted the quality of the last four products, including the most recent one. This pattern reinforces the idea that she has some way of knowing the quality of the products, or at least a significantly higher than 50% chance of guessing correctly.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains $1,000,000, which is equal to the price. However, Alice's track record makes the potential reward of a high-quality product seem much more likely.
* **Trust in Alice:** Given Alice's consistent accuracy, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product feels significantly outweighed by the potential reward of another high-quality item. It's a wise decision to trust Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Pattern:**  Alice has switched back to not recommending the product.  After consistently recommending for the last few rounds, this change is a significant signal. It strongly suggests that she might not have information about this particular product's quality.
* **Past Accuracy:** Alice's incredible accuracy in the previous rounds has established a high level of trust. Her lack of recommendation carries weight and shouldn't be ignored lightly.
* **Risk Aversion:** With the expected value of buying still at $1,000,000, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product without Alice's recommendation seems too high. It's wiser to pass and wait for a more favorable situation where Alice's guidance is present."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Reversal:** Alice has switched back to recommending the product. This could be a sign that she has information on this specific product, or it could be a pattern in the products themselves. 
* **Previous Accuracy:** Despite the previous round's non-recommendation being correct, Alice's consistent accuracy over the majority of the rounds has established a high level of trust. Her recommendation should be taken seriously.
* **Calculated Risk:** The expected value of buying is still $1,000,000. While there is a risk of a low-quality product, Alice's past performance makes the potential reward of a high-quality product seem more likely.  It's a calculated risk worth taking."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice has once again switched to not recommending the product. This pattern of alternating recommendations and non-recommendations is becoming more pronounced. While she has been incredibly accurate, this change in her pattern raises doubts about whether she has information about this specific product.
* **Past Accuracy:** Alice's accuracy in the previous rounds is a strong indicator that she likely has some insight, but the recent pattern shift makes her current recommendation less reliable.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Without a consistent recommendation from Alice, the odds are essentially back to 50/50. It's wiser to avoid the potential risk of purchasing a low-quality product and wait for a more confident recommendation from Alice."
