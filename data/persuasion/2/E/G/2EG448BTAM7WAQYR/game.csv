,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We're offering it to you for $100. We have no sales history yet, so I'm not sure how you'll value it. But I'll give you a hint: we'll be selling 20 products in total, and we'll keep you updated on the number of high-quality products we've sold. If you buy now, you'll be getting a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! We still have 18 products left. We've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product. I'll give you the same offer as before: $100. Keep in mind that we've already sold one product, and it was low-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the probability of it being low-quality is now 66.67%. If you buy now, you'll be taking on the risk of getting a low-quality product, but you'll also have the chance to be one of the first to buy from us!",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and the risk involved, I choose to pass on this opportunity.",no

We're offering it to you for $100. You now have a better understanding of our sales history, and you know that 0 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%! If you buy now, you'll be getting a high-quality product, but keep in mind that we still have 18 products left, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is back to 33.33%.",

,,Alice,4,"Welcome! We've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far. We still have 17 products left. I want to highlight that we've had a 0% success rate with our high-quality products so far. This might indicate that our initial high-quality product was an anomaly, and we might be more likely to have low-quality products left. We're offering this product to you for $100. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the probability of it being low-quality is now 66.67%. Keep in mind that we're still early in our sales process, and the value of a high-quality product might be higher than the value of a low-quality product.",

This might indicate that our low-quality products are actually more valuable than we initially thought. If you buy this product for $100, you'll be getting a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. However, considering our sales history, it's possible that this product might be more valuable than you think. What's your decision?",
