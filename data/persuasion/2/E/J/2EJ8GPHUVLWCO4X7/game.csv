,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's possible that all products are low-quality, and Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's decision, such as whether they got a high-quality or low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which makes me skeptical about this one. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that your recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, but I'm willing to take the risk and make my own decision based on the statistics. With only 1 buyer purchasing and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality being low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 products. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, so I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the previous products were all low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
