You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, but I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, the same price as the last one. It's a bit of a gamble, but I'm hoping you'll take the chance!",

I want to let you know that I've been selling high-quality products for 3 out of the last 4 rounds, which is a pretty strong streak.
