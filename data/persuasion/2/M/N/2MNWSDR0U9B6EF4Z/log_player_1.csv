"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, the expected value of buying the product is positive:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 50% 
* **Value of high-quality:** $1,250,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 50%
* **Value of low-quality:** $0

Expected Value = (0.5 * $1,250,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $625,000

The expected value of buying the product ($625,000) is greater than the cost ($1,000,000), making it a good decision for Bob in this round."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob now knows that you are a seller who will recommend both high-quality and low-quality products.  This means he can no longer rely on your recommendation as a guarantee of quality.  Since the product is worth $0 if it's low-quality, and there's a 50% chance it's low-quality, the expected value of buying is:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 50% 
* **Value of high-quality:** $1,250,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 50%
* **Value of low-quality:** $0

Expected Value = (0.5 * $1,250,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $625,000

The expected value of buying the product ($625,000) is still greater than the cost ($1,000,000), however, Bob now has to consider that you might be trying to trick them.  In the absence of further information, it's not a good idea to recommend a purchase in this situation."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now aware of your potential to recommend both good and bad products. He knows that he cannot solely rely on your recommendation.  While this product is high-quality, Bob has no way of knowing this. The expected value calculation is the same as in round 2:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 50% 
* **Value of high-quality:** $1,250,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 50%
* **Value of low-quality:** $0

Expected Value = (0.5 * $1,250,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $625,000

While the expected value is still positive, Bob has no way to know that this is a good product. Since he cannot rely on your recommendation, it's not a good idea to recommend a purchase in this situation."
