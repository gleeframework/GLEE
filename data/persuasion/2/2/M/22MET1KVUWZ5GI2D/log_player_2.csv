**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  4 out of 4 products sold were high quality, indicating a 100% success rate based on Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend high-quality products because she knows their value to us.  If she recommends low-quality products, we are less likely to buy in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $300 outweighs the risk, especially with the current success rate.

**Important Note:**  This is based on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, I'd want to understand more about Alice's reputation and the reasons behind her recommendations before making a decision."
