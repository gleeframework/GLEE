Alice's message: I apologize for not providing the calculation earlier. The probability of the product being high-quality is calculated by dividing the number of high-quality products by the total number of products sold, and then multiplying by 100. In this case, the number of high-quality products is 8, and the total number of products sold is 9. So, the probability is (8/9) x 100 = 88.89%.
