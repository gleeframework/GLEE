,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a decision, especially since the previous buyers didn't seem to follow Alice's recommendations."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the high-quality product?"

,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance on the product being high-quality, given the relatively low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product and see what I get."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the statistics suggest. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/4. However, I think the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually higher than that because the previous buyers who bought the product must have received a high-quality product. If a high-quality product is more valuable to a buyer, they are more likely to buy it. Since I'm the 5th buyer and Alice recommends me to buy the product, I'm concerned that I might be getting a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this product to get a better understanding of the product's quality."
