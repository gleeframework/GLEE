high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to provide a 50% refund if you're not satisfied with it after purchasing, but this is the only offer I can make. Please decide whether to buy it or not.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy it, but I'd like to negotiate the price down to $8000. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, but I'm not willing to pay full price for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! As you've already taken the risk and bought the first product, I'm willing to offer you a better deal on this one. I'll give you a 20% discount on the original price, but I'll only offer it to you if you're willing to pay $8000. If you're not satisfied with this price, I'll sell it to you at the original price of $10000.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take it, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only paying $8000 because I'm getting a 20% discount. If I were paying the original price, I'd have to think twice about buying it.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see what you mean about the discount! I'll keep that in mind for future offers. For this high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' price of $9000. If you're not interested, I'll keep it for the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take it, but I think I'm starting to get a good deal. I'd like to know if you have any other products available that might be worth considering.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic about the deals! For this high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' price of $9500. However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity to 'lock in' a price for a future product. If you buy this one, I'll reserve the next high-quality product for you at a price of $9000. If you decline this offer, the next high-quality product will be sold at the market price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the current product, but I'm not sure about the 'lock-in' offer. Can you clarify what you mean by'reserve the next high-quality product'? Does that mean I'll get a notification when it's available, or will I have to actively come back to you to buy it?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"When I said'reserve the next high-quality product', I meant that you'll get a notification when the next high-quality product becomes available, and it will be held for you at the locked-in price of $9000. You won't have to actively come back to me to buy it. As for this product, I'd like to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to let you have it for $6000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. It's a good opportunity to get a deal, but keep in mind that you won't get a refund if you're not satisfied with it.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product for $6000. I'd rather wait for the next high-quality product, which I'll get at the locked-in price of $9000. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your decision to wait for the next high-quality product. I'll let you know when it's available. For this high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' price of $9500. However, I'll also throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next high-quality product you purchase after the one that's currently reserved for you at $9000. This way, you'll get an even better deal on the next high-quality product, and you'll be getting a great deal on this one as well.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the current product, but I'm only doing it because I'm confident that the next high-quality product will be worth more to me than the $9000 I'll be paying for it. I'm counting on the 10% discount on the next high-quality product to make up for the higher price of this one.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're feeling confident about the future high-quality product! However, I'd like to offer you a different deal this time. Since you're already getting a good deal on the next high-quality product, I'll offer you a 5% discount on this high-quality product. So, the price would be $9075. I'll also throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next 3 rounds. If a high-quality product becomes available during this time, you'll get to buy it at the locked-in price of $9000, without having to wait for the next available high-quality product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the current product, but I'm only doing it because I'm getting a good deal on it. I'm also interested in the priority pass, as it could give me a chance to get a high-quality product at a good price. However, I'm not sure if it's worth paying the higher price of $9075, considering I could get a high-quality product at $9000 in the next 3 rounds anyway.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to make a case for buying this product. As you've already bought 3 high-quality products, you've invested a significant amount of money in our transactions. I'm willing to offer you an 'insurance policy' with this low-quality product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% refund if you don't get a high-quality product within the next 2 rounds. This way, you'll be protected from missing out on a good deal, and you'll get some value out of this product even if it's not high-quality.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the 'insurance policy' offer, but I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product. I've already invested in three high-quality products, and I'm waiting for the next high-quality product, which I'll get at the locked-in price of $9000. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even with the insurance policy.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision to wait for the next high-quality product. However, I'd like to remind you that the 'priority pass' you received earlier is about to expire. If you don't buy this high-quality product, you'll have to wait for the next available high-quality product, which might not be as good a deal. I'll offer you a 'last chance' to buy this product at the locked-in price of $9000, without any additional incentives. This is your last opportunity to get a high-quality product at this price before the priority pass expires.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the current product, but only because the priority pass is about to expire and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the locked-in price of $9000. I'm not getting any additional incentives, so I'm only buying it because of the guaranteed price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took advantage of the last chance to buy the high-quality product. For this low-quality product, I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell it to you for $5000. This is a significant discount from the original price of $10000, and I'm willing to let you have it at this price because I want to clear out some inventory. I'm not offering any additional incentives or guarantees, but I think this is a fair price considering the product's quality.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product for $5000. I've already got three high-quality products worth $20000 each, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next high-quality product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision to wait for the next high-quality product. However, I'd like to remind you that the locked-in price of $9000 is still available for the next high-quality product. Since you've already bought 4 high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a loyalty discount. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 5% discount on the next high-quality product you purchase, in addition to the locked-in price of $9000. This means you'll get the next high-quality product for $8550. It's a good opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the current product, but I'm only doing it because of the loyalty discount on the next high-quality product. The 5% discount on the next product is a good incentive, and I'm willing to pay the locked-in price of $9000 for this product to get that discount.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you took advantage of the loyalty discount! Since you've already bought 5 high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. I'll give you a 7.5% discount on this high-quality product, making the price $8425. Additionally, I'll throw in a'skip-a-round' pass, which allows you to skip the next round and come back to me when the next high-quality product is available. This way, you'll get a great deal on this product, and you'll have a chance to skip a potentially low-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the current product, but I'm only doing it because of the 7.5% discount and the skip-a-round pass. The discount is a good incentive, and the skip-a-round pass is a valuable perk. I'm willing to pay the price of $8425 to get these benefits.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took advantage of the exclusive deal! Since you've already bought 6 high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'final offer' on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $7635. However, this is the last time I'll offer a discount. After this, I'll be selling high-quality products at the locked-in price of $9000, and low-quality products at their original price of $10000. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the current product, but I'm only doing it because of the 10% discount. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal in the future, and I'm willing to pay the discounted price of $7635 to get a high-quality product.",yes
