high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous products were low quality, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the product's quality or something else?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $100 for a $0 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the third buyer, and I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think this might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality.
