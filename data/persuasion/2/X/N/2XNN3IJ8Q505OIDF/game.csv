high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on this product.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that all previous products were low-quality. I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that is likely to be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,10,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that Alice is likely recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Since 3 previous buyers also passed on the products, I'm curious to see if the trend will continue. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
