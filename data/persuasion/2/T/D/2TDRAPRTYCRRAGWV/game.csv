low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially given that none of the previous products were high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality. I'm skeptical about this product, and I'd like to pass on it to see if I can get a better deal later."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000, especially since I don't know the true quality until after the purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers purchased the product, it suggests that they received low-quality products, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability. Given that I don't have any information that would make me think the current product is high-quality, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product worth $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended 5 products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the probability of it being high-quality is lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the previous buyers received high-quality products, but since none have been sold, I'm skeptical. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes with more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 7th buyer and I think the probability of the product being low quality is high based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping to be the first one to buy a high-quality product and get the $30000 value."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see for myself."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products recommended to them were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
