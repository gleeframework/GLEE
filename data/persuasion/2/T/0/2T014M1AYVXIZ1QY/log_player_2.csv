Alice's message: I've sold 0 high-quality products so far. This is my first sale. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to be my first customer. If you buy this product, you'll not only get a great deal, but you'll also be helping me build my reputation as a seller. I'm confident that my future products will be of higher quality, and I'd love to have you as a returning customer. The price is $100, a steal for a product that will only appreciate in value as my reputation grows. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

I'd be more inclined to buy if I saw some evidence of consistently high-quality products being sold. Let me know if you have any other sales data available.""}

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I've had 1 low-quality product so far, and 0 high-quality ones. I'm still building my portfolio, but I'm committed to providing the best possible products. I'd like to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that I'll sell you another product at the same price ($100) if the next one is also low-quality. This way, you'll get a second chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?
