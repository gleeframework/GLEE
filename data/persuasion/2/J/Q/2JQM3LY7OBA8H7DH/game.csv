,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation to buy doesn't seem to be based on any reliable information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is reliable given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have received a 'do not buy' recommendation from Alice, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's possible that the products sold were indeed low-quality. I'll pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice is not recommending the product. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% chance. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate the price."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is likely much lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass and let the next buyer decide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers have all rejected the products you recommended, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product by going against your advice."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
