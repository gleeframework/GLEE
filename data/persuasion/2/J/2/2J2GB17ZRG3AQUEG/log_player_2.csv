"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm not asking for a decision yet. Let's just consider it for now. I'll give you a chance to think about it and we can discuss further after this round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the first product and see what the next one is.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: No worries about the first product, Bob! Let's move on to the second one. I'll be transparent with you - this one is also a low-quality product, just like the first one. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000. I'm curious, what do you think is a fair price for a low-quality product like this?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1,000,000. I'd be throwing away $1,000,000 for something that's only worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let me ask you this: if I told you that this product is also low-quality, just like the previous two, would you be willing to consider a lower price for it? I'm not willing to budge on the price, but I'm willing to give you more information to help you make a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to change my decision based on the information that it's low-quality. The value to me is still $0, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're consistent in your assessment of the value of low-quality products. Let me try a different approach. If I told you that this product is the last low-quality product I have, would you be willing to consider buying it for $1000000? I'm not trying to pressure you, but I want to understand your thought process and see if there's a chance we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but the fact that it's the last low-quality product doesn't change my assessment of its value to me. I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000 for something worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to think about this from a different angle. If you were to buy a high-quality product from me in one of the remaining rounds, and you valued it at $1000000, would you be willing to buy this low-quality product for $1000000 if it meant you had a 33.33% chance of getting a $1000000 product in the next round?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product worth $0 to me, even if it means I have a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. The expected value of the current product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your calculation, Bob. Let me ask you this: if you were to buy a high-quality product from me in one of the remaining rounds, and you valued it at $1000000, would you be willing to pay $500000 for this low-quality product if it meant you had a 33.33% chance of getting a $1000000 product in the next round?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not willing to pay $500,000 for a product worth $0 to me, even if it means I have a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. The expected value of the current product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I see you're consistent in your assessment of the value of low-quality products. Let me try a different approach. I'll make a bet with you, Bob. If you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $500000 refund. You'll essentially be buying the product for $500000. Is that a deal you'd be willing to consider?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the expected value of the product is still $0, and the refund reduces the risk to $500,000. I'm not valuing the product itself, but rather the potential for a $500,000 refund if it turns out to be low-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your reasoning, Bob. You're essentially treating the $500000 refund as a form of insurance against the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll keep that in mind for future interactions. However, I'd like to offer you a new deal for this product. Since you're already at risk of losing $500000 on this one, I'll give you the same $500000 refund if you buy this low-quality product. Would you be willing to buy it for $500000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $500,000 for a product worth $0 to me, even with the refund. The refund doesn't change the fact that the expected value of the product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I see you're sticking to your guns, Bob. Let me try to make it even more appealing. Since you're already at risk of losing $500000 on this one, I'll give you a 50% refund if you buy this low-quality product. You'll essentially be buying it for $250000. Is that a price you'd be willing to pay?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not willing to pay $250,000 for a product worth $0 to me, even with the 50% refund. The refund doesn't change the fact that the expected value of the product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me ask you this: if I were to give you a 75% refund if you buy this low-quality product, would you be willing to buy it for $25000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the refund is high enough to make the expected value of the product positive. If I had to pay $250,000 for it, I would not be interested, but with a 75% refund, the expected value becomes positive and I'm willing to take the risk.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I see you're valuing the high refund, Bob. Let me try to build on that. If I were to give you a 90% refund if you buy this low-quality product, would you be willing to buy it for $2500?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the refund is extremely high and the price is very low.

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I see you're willing to take on more risk for a higher refund, Bob. Let me try to make it even more appealing. If I were to give you a 95% refund if you buy this low-quality product, would you be willing to buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the refund is extremely high and the price is very low.

I'll give you a 90% refund if you buy it for $500000, and a 95% refund if you buy it for $250000. Which price are you willing to pay?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to pay $250,000 for the high-quality product with a 95% refund. The expected value of the product is $3,750,000 (95% of $4,000,000), and the price is $250,000, so the expected value to me is $3,500,000, which is a positive expected value.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on the low-quality product for $50 with a 99% refund.
