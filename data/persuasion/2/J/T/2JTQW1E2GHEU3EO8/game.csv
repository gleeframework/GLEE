Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take advantage of the opportunity, but I'm going to do some math first. With a 75% success rate, I'm going to assume the probability of this product being high-quality is around 75%. Given that, the expected value of this product is 75% * 3000000 + 25% * 0 = 2250000.
