"Round 1

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is worth $30,000 to Bob.
* **Price:** The product is being sold for $10,000.
* **Expected value:** Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, the 50% chance of it being high-quality makes the expected value of the product positive: 
    * (0.5 * $30,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $15,000 

Since the expected value ($15,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it is a good deal for Bob in the long run. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."
