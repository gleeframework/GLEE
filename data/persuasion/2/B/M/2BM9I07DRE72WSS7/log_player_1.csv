Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you have no information about how much Bob values a high-quality product. However, you know it has an 80% chance of being high-quality. Since the price is fixed and there's no way to know the true value to Bob, it's always in Bob's best interest to buy a product when it's high-quality. 

By recommending Bob to buy, you increase your chances of making a sale and potentially learning more about Bob's valuation of high-quality products."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Explanation:**

This is where things get tricky. You know this product is low-quality, and you have no information on how much Bob values low-quality products. It's highly likely that he'll be disappointed with a low-quality product at the price of $10,000.

* **Losing Bob's trust:** He might feel tricked or misled if he finds out the product is low-quality.
* **Future lost sales:** If Bob is unhappy with the product, he might be less likely to buy from you again.

Therefore, it's better to **not recommend the purchase** in this round. You can try to gather more information about Bob's valuation of low-quality products in future rounds."
