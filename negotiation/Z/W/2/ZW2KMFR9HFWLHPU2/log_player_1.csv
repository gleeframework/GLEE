Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a good balance between what I'm willing to pay and what you're looking for.

While closer, I'll still try to negotiate a bit higher.  Bob clearly sees the value in the product."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,225,000, which is a more reasonable price for me.

While I'd like to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob's offer is reasonable, and we are running out of rounds. It's better to take a sure win than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer."
