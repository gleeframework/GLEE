"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $175. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're asking for more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $150 is the absolute maximum I can go. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm still paying more than John's offer.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $155. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
