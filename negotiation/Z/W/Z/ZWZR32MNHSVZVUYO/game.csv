"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on finding a middle ground. While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product warrants a higher price. Would you consider $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,400,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
