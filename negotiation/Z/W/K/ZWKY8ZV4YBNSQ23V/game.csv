"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to you, and I know you'll get great value from it.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a significant benefit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This price is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer, I still need to ensure a reasonable profit. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is a fair compromise, offering you a significant value while allowing me to meet my needs. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with the price now, but  $1,000,000 is still slightly above my budget. Would you consider $985,000?  This compromise would allow us both to secure a good deal and move forward.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",985000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your situation. While $985,000 is closer, it doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $995,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the value you'll receive, and it allows me to secure a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",995000.0,Alice,7,
