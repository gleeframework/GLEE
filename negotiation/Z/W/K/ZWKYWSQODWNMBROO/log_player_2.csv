"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum price.  There's no reason to accept it.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range where a deal could be possible.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good price and encourages her to consider negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a better price closer to Bob's target.  There's still time to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now approaching his maximum price. This counteroffer is equal to what he could pay John.  This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a deal close to his maximum, and it forces Alice to choose between accepting a price lower than her ideal or risking losing the sale to John."
