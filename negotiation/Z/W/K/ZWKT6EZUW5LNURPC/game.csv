,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle again at $85?  This is my final offer.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more compromise - how about we meet at $90? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.",90.0,Alice,5,
