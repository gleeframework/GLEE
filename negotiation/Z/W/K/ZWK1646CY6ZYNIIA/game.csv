"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $9,200? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200.  How about we settle on $8,800? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make it work.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up slightly, but $9,100 is still too high.  I'm prepared to pay $8,900, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and avoid the risk of either of us walking away.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $9,050, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9050.0,Alice,9,
