Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win situation.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm willing to go down to at least $150 (John's offer), but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean losing a considerable amount of money. 

While selling to John for $150 is a safe option, I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob.  

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer but not conceding too much. 
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of a fair deal for both of us, aiming to create a sense of collaboration. 
* **Strong but not aggressive:**  The message is firm but avoids being confrontational, keeping the negotiation open.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desire to maximize profit and the need to find common ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll get stuck in a back-and-forth with increasingly smaller increments. 

John is offering me a guaranteed $150, which is more than what Bob is currently offering. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a secure deal with John."
