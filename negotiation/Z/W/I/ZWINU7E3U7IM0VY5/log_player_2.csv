"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, and you have 10 rounds to work with.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm really interested in the product but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $8,500? That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for compromise. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my target of $12,000. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise and only $500 more than my counteroffer.  I'm happy to accept this deal as it's within my budget and saves me $3,000 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate risks going over my budget or running out of time."
