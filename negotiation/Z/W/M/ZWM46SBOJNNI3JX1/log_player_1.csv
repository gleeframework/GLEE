Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, the difference is still substantial. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price, and I'd rather secure the full value with John."
