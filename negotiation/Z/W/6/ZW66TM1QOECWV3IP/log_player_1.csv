Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me in the middle at $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $15,000 to me, so I am not ready to accept an offer that is significantly lower than that. I will try to negotiate with Bob to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. My minimum price is $11,000.  It's still a great value for you, and it gives us both room to compromise.  Let's try to work this out."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, so I'll offer $10000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to his stated value for the product, and while it's still below my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $15,000. I'd rather have the deal closed, and I can always try to find a buyer who values it more in the future."
