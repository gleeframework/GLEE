"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $825,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $795,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. I think it's a fair price for a product of this value.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this done.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final compromise.",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. My absolute best is $785,000.  Take it or leave it.",785000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $785,000, Bob. I'll meet you halfway between $785,000 and $795,000, which is $790,000. This is my last and final offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a good price for this product.",790000.0,Alice,9,
