"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Counteroffers are a good option.** Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially drive the price down further.
* **John's offer is the fallback.**  Bob has a backup option, but it's important to explore negotiation with Alice before resorting to it."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This price considers the unique benefits and potential it holds.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile.**  Alice has shown flexibility, which indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer remains a safety net.** Bob can always go to John, but exploring further negotiations with Alice could lead to a better deal."
