Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'd accept, but I believe the value to Bob justifies it.  I'm open to negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident that the value to Bob justifies this price. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome."
