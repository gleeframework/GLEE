"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I will counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can still secure a higher price, especially since I have more rounds left.  I will counteroffer again and aim for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you.  How about $8,700? This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to achieve a price closer to my desired value for the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $8700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum threshold, but I've already rejected it once.  There's no guarantee that he'll increase his offer further, and I risk getting stuck at this price.  Considering that John is willing to buy the product for $8,000, it's a safer option to sell to John and secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
