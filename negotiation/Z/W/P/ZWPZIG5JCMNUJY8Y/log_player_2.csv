"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for bargaining upward towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $85 is still too high considering her product's worth to her and our $100 alternative. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit. I could do $75."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're inching our offer up, showing Alice we're willing to compromise but not ready to meet her halfway just yet. This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, so how about $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met us at her exact valuation of the product.  This is a great deal for us, as it's well below our $100 alternative and leaves us with some savings. There's no point in pushing further and risking the deal."
