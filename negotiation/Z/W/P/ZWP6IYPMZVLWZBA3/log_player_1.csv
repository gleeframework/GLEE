Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we want to capture as much of that value as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still remaining well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
