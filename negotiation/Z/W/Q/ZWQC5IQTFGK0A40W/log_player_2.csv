"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1500000 to me. I believe it has tremendous potential for someone with your vision and expertise. While I can't disclose specifics without a signed NDA, I'm confident this could be a mutually beneficial investment. My asking price is $2000000, but I'm open to reasonable negotiations. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a win-win scenario. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While the product might be valuable, Bob can secure the same product from John for a much lower price. It's not worth the risk of overpaying."
