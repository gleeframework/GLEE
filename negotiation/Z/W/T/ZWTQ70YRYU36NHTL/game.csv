"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from $9,000. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",7800.0,Bob,4,
