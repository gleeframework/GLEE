"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. I'm confident it's worth more than $1,500,000 to you, but I'll start by offering it at $1,200,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To further align our interests, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair value for the product while being more accommodating to your budget. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000 for the product, which is a significant step towards meeting your needs while staying within my budget. Let's find a common ground at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your feedback and our ongoing dialogue, I'm proposing a price of $1,087,500 for the product. This represents a compromise between our initial offers, aiming to be fair to both parties. I hope this suggestion will help us reach an agreement.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
