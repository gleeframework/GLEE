"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $95? That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $95 isn't quite feasible for me, but I'm eager to make a deal. How about we split the difference and call it $105? That's my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
