"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about $11,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  How about we split the difference this time?  $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. That's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me there?",10750.0,Bob,6,
