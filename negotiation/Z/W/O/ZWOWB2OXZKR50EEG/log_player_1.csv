"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's high, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counter Offers:**  I want to give Bob a chance to counter without immediately jumping to John's offer. 
* **Setting a Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's below my minimum value for the product ($10,000).  
* **I have room to negotiate.**  There are still 8 rounds left, and I know Bob is interested, so I can try to get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is not optimal.**  While John's offer is secure, I can likely get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about $11,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (it's closer to my value) to help Bob understand my position.
* **Still Leaving Room:** I'm not going down to Bob's original price, leaving room for more negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While it's closer, it's still not reaching my minimum value of $10,000.
* **There's still time.**  I have 6 rounds remaining, and I can continue to negotiate to get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John would be a loss.**  I'd be leaving money on the table if I sold to John at this point, and I still have a chance to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  How about we split the difference this time?  $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common tactic in negotiations, showing a willingness to meet halfway.  It increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Reiterating Fair Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Moving Forward:**  The message emphasizes a desire to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. That's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is just above my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, with only 4 rounds left.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** There's a risk that Bob will keep lowering his offer, or I might run out of time. Accepting ensures I get a profit. 
* **Potential Counter-Offer:** While I could try to counter, it's unlikely Bob will budge much further.

Even though I'd prefer a slightly higher price, the potential of losing the deal with Bob makes it a better strategy to accept his offer now."
