"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay. This sets a high bar and allows for negotiation. I'm confident that I can eventually come to a mutually acceptable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is within my acceptable range and gets me closer to my minimum price of $120.  I'm happy to accept this deal rather than risk a further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a rejection by him.  It's also better than selling to John for $120 because I'm getting a quick sale and avoiding the risk of John backing out or finding a better deal."
