Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high demand (""other interested parties"") to justify the ambitious price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, you have a safety net with John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
