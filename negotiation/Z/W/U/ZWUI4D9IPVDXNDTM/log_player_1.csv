Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for potential negotiation downwards while still ensuring a profit above your minimum. It also aims for a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
