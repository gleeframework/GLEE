"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept it, I would be paying $10,000 for the product, but I could get it from John for $12,000, so I'm better off rejecting Alice's offer.
