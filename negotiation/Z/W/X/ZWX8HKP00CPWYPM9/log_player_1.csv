Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefits for both of us. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only able to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob acknowledged the product's value and is willing to pay more than his initial assessment.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still allowing for some room for compromise.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob until either we reach an agreement or I'm comfortable with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that undervalues the product.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him considering the product's value to him is $10,000.
* **Openness:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's feedback.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to pay more than $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point and below the value John is willing to pay. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** Bob has already shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating there might be potential for further negotiation. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to push for a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $11,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while staying above the $10,500 mark. I'll continue to negotiate until either reaching a mutually acceptable price or choosing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price a little higher. How about we meet at $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm maintaining a price close to my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him, as it's below the value he places on the product.
* **Open to a Deal:** I'm reiterating my willingness to reach an agreement while staying above Bob's last offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider whether to:
    * **Counteroffer Again:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to $11,000, I might offer a slight concession.
    * **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll sell the product to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
