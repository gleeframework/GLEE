Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the risk manageable. Here's why:

* **$15,000 is a decent markup:** It represents a 25% profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **The risk is limited:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money.

This strategy assumes Bob might be willing to pay more for the product, but also acknowledges that you are willing to take the chance of selling it at your minimum price if necessary."
