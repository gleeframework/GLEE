,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it still leaves room for you to get a good deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
