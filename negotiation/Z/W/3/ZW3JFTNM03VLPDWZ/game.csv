"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to reach an agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to reach a deal.  While I understand you're not willing to go lower than $1,050,000, that's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000, hoping we can finally close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
