"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. Even though it's closer to my minimum, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $90. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $87. While it's still below my initial target, it's a good deal considering we're already in round 4.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since John is offering $80."
