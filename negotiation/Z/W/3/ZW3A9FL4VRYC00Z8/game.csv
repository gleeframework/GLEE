"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering my financial constraints and the potential value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the product's true value and potential significantly exceed that amount.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the real worth of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, $1,900,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from where I value this product. I'm willing to accept $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. ",1650000.0,Alice,5,
