"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate downwards towards your $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Could you do $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($60), we aim to establish a negotiation range that's beneficial to us. This leaves room to gradually increase our offer while staying well below our $80 limit.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This lowball offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she's open to significant negotiation, it increases our chances of getting a great deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the backup option of buying from John for $80. This knowledge gives us leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $90 is closer to our budget, it's still above our $80 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move from $110 to $90 suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  The option to buy from John for $80 gives us leverage to push for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, Alice.  How about $70? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increment:** We're increasing our offer by $10, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but remaining firm on getting a good deal.
* **Staying Below Limit:**  $70 keeps us below our $80 maximum and leaves a little wiggle room for a final compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us gauge how close Alice is willing to get to our ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. How about we try $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's final offer of $85 is still above our $80 limit.
* **Firm Stance:**  Her language (""That's the lowest I'm willing to go."") indicates she's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Better Alternative:** We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which meets our budget exactly."
