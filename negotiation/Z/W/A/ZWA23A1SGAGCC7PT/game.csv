"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider this price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $150 is the absolute minimum I can do.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $130 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $140? This is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you consider this price?",135.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I can't go any lower than $140. This product is really worth it, and $140 is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $140, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $135, and that's my final offer. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",135.0,Bob,8,
