"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, it leaves a significant margin for potential savings.
* **Negotiation potential:**  You have room to negotiate a better price.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always fall back to John if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value. This product offers substantial returns, and I'm confident it's worth a premium.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is closer to your target, but there's still room to push for a lower price. 
* **Value discrepancy:** Alice is acknowledging the product's value, but her pricing is still higher than your assessment.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** You can always buy from John if you can't reach a suitable agreement with Alice."
