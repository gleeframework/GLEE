Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it for even slightly less still nets a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $11,000 is:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving room for negotiation if needed.
    * Attractive enough compared to John's offer that Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This language adds perceived value and urgency, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
