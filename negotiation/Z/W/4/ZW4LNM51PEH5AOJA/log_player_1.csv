Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" (saving $1,000) while maximizing your profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John who will buy it for $12,000. This allows you to be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
