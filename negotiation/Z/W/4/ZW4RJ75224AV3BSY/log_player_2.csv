**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in a discussion. In light of your offer, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product. This price still reflects its high value and quality, while providing a reasonable margin for both parties. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than your ideal. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering again. You have some room to negotiate further, knowing Alice values the product at $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you at a price of $887,500. This amount reflects the value you perceive in the product, while also allowing for a fair profit margin. I hope this proposal will lead us to an agreement that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now lower than what John is offering, so accepting is the most beneficial option. This saves you $112,500 compared to buying from John. While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't go lower than her current offer, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of her walking away or you running out of time. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
