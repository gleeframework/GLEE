Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to try and push for a higher price. Bob is already showing he's interested and willing to negotiate."

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and we're close to my target. At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the sale."
