{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him a reason to negotiate and potentially find a price both of you are happy with. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and think it could be useful. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you have the potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation. You've already established a higher value for the product (in round 1) and can leverage that to potentially get closer to your desired price of $14,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This still keeps me within my spending limits while allowing us to reach an agreement. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's above your minimum price of $12,000 and closer to your desired price of $14,000. While you could continue negotiating, the potential gains are small and the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher. It's better to accept this offer and secure a good sale."
