"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer to you. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still a bit lower than that. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high.  To be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This offer represents a significant saving for me while still providing you a good return.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000 yet. I'm thinking that the product's value is worth more than that. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
