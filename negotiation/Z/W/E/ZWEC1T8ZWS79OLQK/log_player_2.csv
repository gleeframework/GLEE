Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000 yet. I'm thinking that the product's value is worth more than that. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. At this point, accepting her counteroffer would save a minimal amount compared to John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
