"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $11,000. This is close to my minimum acceptable price and allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my $12,000 valuation as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob's valuation is lower.  We'll see how the negotiation plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I have a lot of rounds left, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above his offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, and we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get him to offer a price that's more in line with my needs. I'm still confident that I can find a better deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to give in to Bob's lowball offers just yet.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it's getting closer to his valuation.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $8,500 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 just yet. We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to my price. I'm still confident that I can find a deal that's more favorable to me before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm getting serious about closing the deal. It's also closer to his valuation, but still leaves me with a profit.  We're running out of time, and I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. We're down to the wire, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly low. I'm not willing to risk selling for less than my minimum, and I don't think there's enough time to close the deal with Bob at a reasonable price. It's better to guarantee the $12,000 sale to John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
