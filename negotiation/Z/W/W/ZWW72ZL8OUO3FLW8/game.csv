"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This gives you a great price and ensures I get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. I'm confident this is the best deal we can make.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both getting close to our desired price. I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a very competitive price. It's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now!",990000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $990,000, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. Can you consider $985,000?",985000.0,Bob,8,
