"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about we bring it down significantly?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price point that works for both of us.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
