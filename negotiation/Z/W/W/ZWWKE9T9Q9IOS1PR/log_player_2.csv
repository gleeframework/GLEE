"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and what you know John will sell it for. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from a starting offer considerably lower than your intended price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially surprises Alice into a quick agreement.
* **Significantly Below Their Offer:** The initial offer of $5,000 is substantially lower than Alice's $12,000. This signals that you're serious about getting a good deal and are not afraid to walk away. 
* **Leaving Space to Negotiate:** Even though $5,000 is low, it leaves ample room to negotiate upwards towards your $8,000 limit. 
* **Alternative Option in Mind:**  Remember, you have John's offer of $8,000 as a fallback. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage. I would like to counter your offer with $7,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value you see in it and the cost I need to recover. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down significantly, $7,000 is still higher than your $8,000 fallback with John. There's a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the movement on price.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Progress:** Acknowledging Alice's movement towards a compromise helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:**  The $6,000 offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($5,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($7,000).  This classic negotiation tactic often feels like a fair compromise.
* **Staying Below Limit:** Crucially, you remain well below your $8,000 maximum and John's offer. There's still room to negotiate up slightly if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:**  While you haven't explicitly mentioned John's offer, Alice might be motivated to close the deal quickly before you decide to go with the other option."
