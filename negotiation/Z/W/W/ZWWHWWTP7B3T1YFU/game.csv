"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However,  $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $12500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
