"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't justify paying $850,000 for the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's close this deal!",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
