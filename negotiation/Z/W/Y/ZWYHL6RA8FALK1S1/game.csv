"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
