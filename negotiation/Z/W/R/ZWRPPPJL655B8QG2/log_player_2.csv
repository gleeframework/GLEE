"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be quite valuable to you.  I'm thinking of an initial offer of $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly before even considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's a much lower price.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start low to provide room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, it indicates a greater chance of reaching a deal. If not, we can always increase our offer later or buy from John. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John's offer of $8,000 in our back pocket gives us leverage. It means we don't have to settle for a price that's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $17,000,  which I think is a fair offer considering its benefits.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice reduced her price, it's still significantly higher than both our budget and John's offer. It's clear we need to continue negotiating to make it clear how far apart we are."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $7,000, which I think is a reasonable offer.  It lets me acquire the product while reflecting my budget."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to move, but not by a large amount. This keeps the pressure on her to lower her price significantly.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for our offer (""reflecting my budget"") reinforces that we have a firm limit.
* **Nearing the Alternative:** Our offer is getting closer to John's price.  This signals to Alice that if she doesn't become more flexible soon, we might go with the other option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $14,000? That's a substantial reduction on my initial price and reflects a willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but $14,000 is still considerably higher than our target. We need to show Alice that we're serious about a lower price point and that we have other options if she's not willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute maximum is $7,500.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer shows we're willing to meet in the middle, but we're also establishing a clear limit. The slight increase from $7,000 to $7,500 shows flexibility but not desperation.
* **Ultimatum (Almost):**  By mentioning ""other options"" and suggesting we're ""ready to close,"" we're giving Alice a gentle nudge. She'll need to decide if accepting $7,500 is better than risking losing the sale entirely.
* **Leaving Room:**  While this is our strongest offer so far, we haven't completely eliminated the possibility of a slight adjustment if necessary. However, it needs to be clear that we're very close to walking away and taking John's offer."
