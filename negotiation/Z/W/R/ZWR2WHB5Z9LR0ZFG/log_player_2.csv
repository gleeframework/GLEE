# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, increasing the chances of her coming back with a lower price."
