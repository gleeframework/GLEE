"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. You'll be getting the product for significantly less than it's worth to you, and I'll be able to earn a substantial amount for my product. If you decline, I have another offer for $800,000, but I'd rather sell to you if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
