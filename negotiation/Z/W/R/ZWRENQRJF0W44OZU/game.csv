"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. You'll be getting the product for significantly less than it's worth to you, and I'll be able to earn a substantial amount for my product. If you decline, I have another offer for $800,000, but I'd rather sell to you if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,1,
