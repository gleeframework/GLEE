"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd love to offer you this great product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $110 is higher than your maximum budget of $80 and even higher than John's offer of $80. It makes the most sense to buy from John to get the best price."
