"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on this valuable product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a reasonable return, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, which I appreciate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and allows me to secure a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",990000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm not comfortable going above $980,000. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, but no higher. This is my final offer.",985000.0,Bob,6,
