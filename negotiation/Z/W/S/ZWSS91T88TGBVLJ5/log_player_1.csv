"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $10,000, but that's really my limit.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting pretty close to my absolute limit. I could go up to $11,500, but that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go significantly higher than $11,500.  We're still quite far apart, and I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
