I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives Alice a decent profit, while still saving me a significant amount of money."

While $13,000 is better than $15,000,  I'm still willing to take a chance to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if Alice is willing to budge further."

I'm raising my offer to $10,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful Alice will see that."

At this point, Alice has shown that she's willing to negotiate, but she's firm on her bottom line.  $13,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer and is worth accepting."
