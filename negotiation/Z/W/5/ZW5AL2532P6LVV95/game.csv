"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $13750?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12500. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13250.0,Bob,4,
