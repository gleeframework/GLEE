"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
