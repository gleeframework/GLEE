"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.
