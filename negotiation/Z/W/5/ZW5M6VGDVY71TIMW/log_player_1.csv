"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product and I think you'd be interested. My starting price is $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'd be happy with the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $135.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident I would be happy with the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum price, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and Bob hasn't shown a willingness to meet my needs. I'm running out of time, and John is offering a guaranteed $150.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the other buyer."
