# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a good deal for you compared to the market rate, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is a fair price for Bob considering he is willing to pay up to $100.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a discount."
