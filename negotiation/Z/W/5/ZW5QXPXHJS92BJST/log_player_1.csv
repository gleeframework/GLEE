Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob immediately walk away. We want a price that's believable and potentially tempting. 
* **Knowing Your Alternatives:** We have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $120. This allows us to be a bit more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob. 

It's important to remember that this is just the opening move.  Bob's response will determine how we proceed with the negotiation."
