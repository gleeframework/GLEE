Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go below $100. This product is worth a lot more than $80, and I'm confident it will be worth your investment.  Let's meet in the middle.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $100, and we know we can get the product for $80 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
