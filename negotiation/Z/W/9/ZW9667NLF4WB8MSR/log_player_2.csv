Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also being fair to me.

You're still closer to your desired price than Alice is to hers.  Reject and counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with a price of $1320000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer. You're at $1,320,000, which is still a good deal for you and within your budget.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and you'd have to buy from John at a much higher price."
