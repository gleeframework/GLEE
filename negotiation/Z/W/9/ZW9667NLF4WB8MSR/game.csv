"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also being fair to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $1300000 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with a price of $1320000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
