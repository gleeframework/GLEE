"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. ",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,200,000 is considerably below what I had in mind.  I'm willing to meet you partway.  How about  $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, but I need a bit more. How about $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, which is $1,262,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1262500.0,Bob,6,
