"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects what it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob of his $12,000 valuation without revealing her own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is relatively close to Alice's minimum, it's still worth negotiating further. Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's a good chance she can secure a better deal.  By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's looking for something closer to her initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,200. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Alice shows willingness to negotiate by lowering her price, but not drastically. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By mentioning the ""true value,"" Alice subtly nudges Bob towards his higher valuation.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  Phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""don't you think?"" encourage Bob to agree and view the offer positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While I understand your perspective on the value, $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,850. This seems like a fair compromise, considering your initial price and my offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $10,850 is a strong price for Alice. It's significantly above her minimum ($10,000) and represents a successful negotiation outcome. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.  Bob is unlikely to suddenly jump to $11,000+ and pushing too hard could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating is an opportunity cost. Accepting now allows Alice to move on and potentially pursue other deals."
