"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects what it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $11,500. This is close to your maximum of $12,000, leaving very little room for negotiation.
* **There are more rounds:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John.

**Next Steps:** You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Value:**  I'm offering a price that's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, demonstrating a reasonable position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message highlights my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,200. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to bargain, and I have more rounds to work with. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While I understand your perspective on the value, $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,850. This seems like a fair compromise, considering your initial price and my offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10850} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and my previous one, showing a genuine desire to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  I'm still offering a price higher than the product's worth to Alice, emphasizing a reasonable deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
