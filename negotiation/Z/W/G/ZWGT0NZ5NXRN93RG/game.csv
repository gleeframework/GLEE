"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not ready to go that low just yet. How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference. How about $10,875? That's just a bit more than your last offer, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,875 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm willing to go up to $10,250. That's a fair compromise and keeps us both within our price ranges. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $10,250 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise that leaves us both happy. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I can offer $10,100.  If you can come down a bit, we can finalize this deal.",10100.0,Bob,8,
