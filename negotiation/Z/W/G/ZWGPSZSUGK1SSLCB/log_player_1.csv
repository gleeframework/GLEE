Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it still allows for some negotiation room if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm confident that I can get a higher price if necessary, and I can always fall back on John's offer of $150 if Bob isn't willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $150, and I'm not going to accept his counteroffer.  I'll try to get a better price from him, or I'll just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise a little bit more to see if we can reach an agreement.  $120 is still a good price for Bob, and it gives me some room to negotiate if he wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product and am willing to pay $90 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price that's so low, especially since John is already waiting to buy the product for $150.  I'll take John's offer and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
