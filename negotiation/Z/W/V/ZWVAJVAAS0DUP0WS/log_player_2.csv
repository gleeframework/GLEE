"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth a substantial investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price.  Rejecting allows us to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my ideal price, but $1,100,000 is still too high.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price with another counteroffer. We've already established that there's room for negotiation, and I'm not going to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is closer to my ideal price of $1,000,000.  While I could keep negotiating, the risk is that we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to take the deal and secure the product for a decent price."
