"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $22,000 to me. I'd be willing to consider a price of $15,000, which is still a premium for me, but I think it's a more reasonable price given the market value.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $19,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get closer to the lower end of the spectrum. How about we discuss $16,000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  $16,000 is close, but I have to consider what I'm giving up. How about we make it $17,500, and we have a deal? ",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'd need to get closer to the lower end of the spectrum. How about we discuss $15,500?",15500.0,Bob,6,
