"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go to $155. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",155.0,Bob,4,
