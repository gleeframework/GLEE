Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 creates a potential $15 profit ($95 - $80) while still being below John's buying price. This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
