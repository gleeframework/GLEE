Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $80. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $78. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $80 guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the best option."
