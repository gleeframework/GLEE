"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  We begin significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000).  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""potential,"" we provide a reason for the high initial price, framing it as an investment opportunity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling our willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value by setting a high initial price point.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to understand his willingness to pay and negotiation style.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:**  We can always adjust our price downwards in subsequent rounds if needed, but starting high gives us more bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my target, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  

It's still early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further. Rejecting his offer signals that I'm serious about getting a better price and keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, I'm confident this product has the potential to deliver even greater returns than you anticipate.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and slightly lower our price, demonstrating flexibility. However, we still maintain a price significantly above his offer, emphasizing the product's potential.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The counteroffer of $1,700,000 is a substantial decrease from our initial price but still above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals a willingness to negotiate while holding firm to a reasonable valuation.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** We want to convey that we believe in the product's value and are not desperate to settle for less. This can encourage Bob to stretch his budget further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's potential, Alice, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but $1,350,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  I need to hold firm.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm prepared to walk away if I can't get a price that reflects the product's true worth to me. I'll make one more counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, hoping Bob will meet me there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle this right now - I'm proposing a final price of $1,550,000."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous price, demonstrating some flexibility. However, it's still above my absolute minimum, ensuring I get a reasonable deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""Let's settle this right now,"" I introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Final Offer:**  Labeling this as my ""final price"" signals that I'm not willing to negotiate further down. This can prompt Bob to seriously consider the offer rather than risk losing the deal. 

I'm taking a calculated risk by presenting a firm offer slightly above my minimum. Bob's responses suggest he's interested but price-sensitive. This offer might be enough to close the deal while still generating a significant profit. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely walk away and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to be realistic, Alice, but I still think $1,550,000 is too high. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is the best price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. It seems unlikely he'll agree to a price that meets my needs.  

Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob.  There's no point in continuing to haggle when I can secure my minimum acceptable price elsewhere."
