"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily decreasing the price throughout the negotiation.  Alice has also shown a willingness to compromise.  At this point, Bob is only $280,000 away from his ideal price, and rejecting the offer might mean losing the deal to John.  Therefore, accepting the offer for $1,280,000 is a reasonable compromise and the best option for Bob."
