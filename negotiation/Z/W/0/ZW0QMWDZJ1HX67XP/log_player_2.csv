"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $14,000, which is $2,000 more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's closer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should continue to try and lower the price.  He can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,500. This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but also that he's serious about getting a good deal.  It's a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, and could be a good starting point for reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally offered a price that is within Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to get the price lower, it's unlikely that Alice will go any lower, especially with the option of selling to John for the same price.  Accepting the offer is the best decision for Bob, as it allows him to purchase the product at the maximum price he's willing to pay."
