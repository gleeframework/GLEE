"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable margin for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to discussing it further.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget constraints. If you accept this offer, we can finalize the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.
