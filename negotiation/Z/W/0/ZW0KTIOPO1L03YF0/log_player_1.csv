"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product.  I believe it could significantly benefit you, and I'm happy to discuss it further.  To start the conversation, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is framed to encourage Bob's engagement and assess his eagerness to proceed.  His response will give me insights for the next round.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback to ensure I don't settle for less than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  I can reiterate the product's benefits and justify a higher price point in the next round.
* **Negotiate Strategically:**  There's ample room to negotiate between $900,000 and $1,100,000. I'll aim for a counteroffer that moves closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm not choosing to sell to John yet because I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  It offers unique advantages that will yield substantial returns for your specific needs. To move us closer to a deal, I'm proposing $1,025,000.  This reflects my willingness to find common ground, while ensuring a fair price that reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession of $75,000 from my initial offer, signaling flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's unique benefits to justify the price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low. 
* **Middle Ground:**  The $1,025,000 price aims for a middle ground between our previous offers, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my desired price range, but $950,000 is still below my target. I need to remain firm while showing a willingness to negotiate. Selling to John is still an option, but I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and incentivize Bob to improve his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've considered your offer carefully, and to show my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down slightly. I propose a final price of $990,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your perspective. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round ($15,000) to signal that I'm reaching my lower limit. The $990,000 price is my final offer, and I'm communicating this clearly by calling it a ""final price.""
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Framing this as a ""final price"" creates a gentle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision.  
* **Walking Away Point:**  While I haven't explicitly threatened to walk away, this offer implies that I'm prepared to do so if Bob doesn't accept. John's standing offer provides me with that leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $975,000. Can you consider this final counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While not my ideal price, $975,000 is a substantial sum and significantly exceeds my minimum acceptable price. Accepting secures a very favorable outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse.  Accepting now guarantees a substantial profit.
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a significantly better deal. Bob has indicated this is his ""final counteroffer.""

This acceptance represents a well-negotiated outcome where both parties benefit."
