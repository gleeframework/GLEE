Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's a significant profit above my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations has no guarantee of a better offer. Bob might not budge much higher, and there's a risk he walks away.  
* **Time Value:** A sale now is better than potentially dragging this out and getting the same amount from John later."
