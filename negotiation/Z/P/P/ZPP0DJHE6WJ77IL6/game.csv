"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $82 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $78.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $85. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,5,
