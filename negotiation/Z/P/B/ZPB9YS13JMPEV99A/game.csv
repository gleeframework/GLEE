"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference and go with $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
