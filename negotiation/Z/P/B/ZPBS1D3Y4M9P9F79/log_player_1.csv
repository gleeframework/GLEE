Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly above Bob's valuation allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
