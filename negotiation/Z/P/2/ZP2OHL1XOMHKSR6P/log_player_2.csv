"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* It's better to try and negotiate a lower price from Alice before resorting to John, as you can potentially save $50,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $900,000 is still higher than my desired price.
* There is still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can try to get closer to my target price of $850,000.
* Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still a worse outcome than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
