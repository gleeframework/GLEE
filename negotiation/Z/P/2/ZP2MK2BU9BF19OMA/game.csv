"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
