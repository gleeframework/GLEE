Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I'm willing to make you a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $14,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it above that but below John's offer creates a potential win-win.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice creates a strong chance of:

* **Bob Accepting:**  He gets the product for $2,500 less than its worth to him.
* **Alice Profiting:**  She makes $14,500,  almost her maximum possible profit.

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her desired price."
