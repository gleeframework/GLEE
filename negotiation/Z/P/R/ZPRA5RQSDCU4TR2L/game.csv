,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you outlining the product's value, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my initial price to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the potential for us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to come up to $900,000. While I value your perspective, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price to ensure a favorable outcome.  Let's aim for a compromise of $925,000. This price acknowledges your value assessment while allowing me to achieve my desired result. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a favorable outcome, and I'm happy to continue working towards a solution. However, $925,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement at this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come up to $910,000. To finalize this deal and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000. This reflects both our needs and allows us to move forward confidently. I'm confident this price will be a win for both of us.",915000.0,Alice,7,
