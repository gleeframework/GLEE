Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come up to $910,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that is just barely above my desired price point.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it also risks the deal falling through entirely, leaving me with only the option to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price while mitigating the risk of losing the opportunity."
