Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to overshoot and risk Bob rejecting your offer. Aiming high within the ZOPA makes sense.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear and positions the product as valuable.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your bottom line, you hint at the ""unique value"" to support the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** You've started high but left some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
