(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,150,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* This offer is better than buying from John for $1,200,000. 
* While you can potentially try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer guarantees you the product at a good price within your budget."
