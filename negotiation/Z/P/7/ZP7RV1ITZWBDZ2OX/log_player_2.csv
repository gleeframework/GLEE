{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's slightly higher than his ideal price, it's still a good deal. He's only a few rounds away from having to buy from John for $800,000.  He's likely to get a better price buying from John, but there's a good chance he could reach an impasse with John and run out of time.  He's better off accepting this offer and securing the product."
