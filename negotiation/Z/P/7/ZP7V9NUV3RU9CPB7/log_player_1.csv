"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $8,500, I'm holding out for a better deal.  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and I'm confident I can get closer to that amount with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  This move shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I also won't be giving away the product for a price that is too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident that I can get closer to that amount with further negotiation. 

I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first.  I'll make another counteroffer, hopefully getting closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,500.  This would be a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm continuing to be firm on my price, but I'm also showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway.  I'm confident that $9,500 is a good price for both of us and I'm hoping that this will be the final offer.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to reconsider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $9,500 is still a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident this price would make both of us happy, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I also need to consider how many rounds are left.  If Bob keeps rejecting, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,400. This would give us both a good deal.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and I think this is a fair compromise.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,400.  It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still closer to my minimum acceptable price.  We're getting very close to closing the deal, but I still need to get a price that I'm comfortable with.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
