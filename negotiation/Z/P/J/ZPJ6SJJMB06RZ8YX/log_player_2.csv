**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, knowing you have John's offer of $12,000 as a fallback."
