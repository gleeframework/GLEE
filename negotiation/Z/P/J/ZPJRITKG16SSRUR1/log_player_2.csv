"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to go down to $7,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200.  Since I can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's no longer worth my time to negotiate with Alice."
