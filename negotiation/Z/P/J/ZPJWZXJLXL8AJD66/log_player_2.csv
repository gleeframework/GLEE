"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I think this represents a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Since you can get the product from John for the same price as Alice's offer, it's better to reject Alice's offer and keep the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or buy from John."
