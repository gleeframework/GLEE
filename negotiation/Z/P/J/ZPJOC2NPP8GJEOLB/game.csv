"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
