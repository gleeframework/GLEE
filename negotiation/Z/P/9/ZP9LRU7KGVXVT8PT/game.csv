"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $16,000 is fair. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a budget of around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I could offer it for $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle somewhere around $10,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go and still feel good about the deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
