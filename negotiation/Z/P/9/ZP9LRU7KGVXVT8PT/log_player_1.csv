Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $16,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a budget of around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I could offer it for $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle somewhere around $10,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go and still feel good about the deal.
