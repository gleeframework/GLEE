"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's valuable to both of us. I am offering it to you for $1300000. This price reflects its high quality and the benefits it will bring to you. Let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,300,000 is still above your desired price point. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a lower price, potentially saving you even more. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  While John's price is higher, it's a backup plan if you can't reach a better deal with Alice within the 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To better align with your needs, I am now offering the product at $1250000. This price still reflects the value and quality of the product, while providing some flexibility within your budget. I hope this revised offer meets your requirements and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than ideal.** While closer to your target, $1,250,000 is still more than you're willing to pay right now.
* **Rejecting allows further negotiation.** There's still room for negotiation to reach a price you're comfortable with. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to have this option in mind if you can't strike a deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's coming down on the price, $1,225,000 is still above your desired price range. 
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is responding. There's still room to get closer to your target price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's wise to keep this in mind, but with only five rounds left, it's better to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
