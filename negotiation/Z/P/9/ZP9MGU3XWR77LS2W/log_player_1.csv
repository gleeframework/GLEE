"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Being polite:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Reasoning:**  Giving a brief reason for the price makes the offer feel more justified.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and see if Bob is willing to engage."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to secure a deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially reach a more favorable price."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has come closer to my desired price, his final offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
