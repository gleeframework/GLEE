"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that the product is a ""great deal"" and ""very valuable"" to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $90. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still below my minimum.** $90 is better than $80, but I'm confident I can get closer to my $100 goal. 
* **More rounds to negotiate:** I have 9 more rounds, and this gives me a good opportunity to push for a better price. 
* **No immediate need for $80:** I have John as a backup, but I'm not desperate to sell yet, so I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good price.  How about $95?  That's a great deal for both of us, and it's still within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $95, which is $5 more than his offer and only $5 less than my initial offer. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm framing it as a ""great deal for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's desire for a good value.
* **Stay within his budget:** I'm emphasizing that $95 is ""still within your budget"" to ensure he doesn't feel I'm being unreasonable."
