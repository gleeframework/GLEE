Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $19,000. I believe in its value and know it would be a worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.  We want to go significantly higher than that to maximize our potential profit, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate.  He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything. We have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, ensuring we meet our minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a safety net with John's offer."
