Round 5

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely she'll go below $100. I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. It makes sense to take the sure thing at this point rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
