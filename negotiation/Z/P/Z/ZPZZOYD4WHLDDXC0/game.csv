"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,250,000. This price is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,175,000? That seems like a fair price to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still not there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's close this now and both walk away happy.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to $1,185,000.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1185000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're so close!  I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,192,500.  This is the best I can do, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny. Let's seal the deal!",1192500.0,Alice,7,
