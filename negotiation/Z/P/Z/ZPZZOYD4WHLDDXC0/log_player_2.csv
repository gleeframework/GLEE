"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. What do you say?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,250,000. This price is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still not there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's close this now and both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're so close!  I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,192,500.  This is the best I can do, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny. Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,192,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,192,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  Her offer of $1,192,500 is a good compromise and a reasonable price considering your $1,500,000 limit.  It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal in the remaining rounds."
