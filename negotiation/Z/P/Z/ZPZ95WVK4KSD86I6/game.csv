"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low.  I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,3,
