Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $82 is only $2 more than Bob's previous counteroffer, and it's still a good deal for him. With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob doesn't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate. He can likely get a better price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  He can also buy from John for $100, but this offer from Alice is $18 better."
