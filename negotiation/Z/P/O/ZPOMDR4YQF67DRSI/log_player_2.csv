"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $9500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is comfortable with. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,750.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position. While $8750 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. He's already close to his $8,000 limit, so it's worth pushing for a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 8900}
