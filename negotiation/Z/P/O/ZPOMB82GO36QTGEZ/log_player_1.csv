"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to start high, at $130. I know Bob values the product at $100, so this is a price he'll likely try to negotiate down from. I want to see how willing he is to pay, and hopefully get him to agree to a price closer to my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise, especially considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $110. Hopefully, this will be close enough for him to accept and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round. If not, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $120. Since Bob's last offer was $115, this seems like a reasonable compromise, and hopefully he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John for the same price."
