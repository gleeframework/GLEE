"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At $95, the offer is significantly above my minimum price of $80 and provides a good profit margin.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and I risk him losing interest.
