Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it just below my guaranteed price might seem like a small discount to me, but it's a significant markup for him.  
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning that this is an exclusive offer, I aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly before he potentially loses the opportunity. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, by starting at a higher price point, I leave room for potential negotiation if needed while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
