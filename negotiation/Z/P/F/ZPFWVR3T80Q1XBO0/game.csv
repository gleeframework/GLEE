"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is higher to you, but considering what it's worth to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your perspective, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I cannot agree to $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
