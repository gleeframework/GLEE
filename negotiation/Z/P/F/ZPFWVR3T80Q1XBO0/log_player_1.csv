{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is higher to you, but considering what it's worth to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to try to negotiate further. There are still 8 rounds left, and I might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your perspective, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I cannot agree to $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd prefer $1,500,000, $1,400,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering I only have 6 rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit while avoiding the risk of getting a lower offer in the remaining rounds."
