Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Potential:**  While $9,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial value. This gives me room to negotiate further.
* **Strategic Delay:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Bob is truly committed and willing to go higher. It also keeps the pressure on him, potentially leading to a more favorable deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price still allows me to earn significantly more than Bob's initial offer of $9,000, while also being closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging Bob to close the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll have to assess his seriousness and decide if another counteroffer is worthwhile or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking $9200 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer is the same as his initial counteroffer. This suggests he's not willing to budge further.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be unproductive and time-consuming.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 ensures a guaranteed profit that exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations.

By selling to John, I'm maximizing my profit and minimizing potential losses in this negotiation."
