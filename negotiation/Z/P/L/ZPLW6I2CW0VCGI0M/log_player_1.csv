Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer itself:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he could potentially gain $200,000 in value.
* **Your Leverage:**  You have a fallback option (John), giving you a strong position.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. A price too close to $1,200,000 might discourage him, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think about a price of $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** 
    * Highlights the product's value to Bob.
    * Hints at the price being negotiable without explicitly saying so.
    * Uses positive language (""pleased,"" ""mutually beneficial"") to set a collaborative tone.
* **The Price:**
    * $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain, incentivizing him to buy.
    * It secures a $150,000 profit for you â€“ significantly more than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly based on Bob's response, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
