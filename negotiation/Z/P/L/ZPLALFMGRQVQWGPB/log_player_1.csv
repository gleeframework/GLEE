"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be attractive to him. I'm aiming to start the negotiation high and see if I can find a compromise closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product, but my budget is around $10,000. Let's start with an offer of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price.  I want to see if I can find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. I hope this counteroffer will entice Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a little over budget.  Let's try $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate. Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm still hopeful that I can reach a deal with Bob that's slightly better.  I believe that I can push for a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit on this sale. Let's compromise at $14,500. This would give you a good deal and would allow me to sell at a price that's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give the product away. I believe that $14,500 is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This price would give us both a reasonable deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I've only got 4 rounds left.  If I keep rejecting his offers, we might not reach a deal before the deadline. I'm also concerned that if I continue to negotiate, Bob might start lowballing me even further.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
