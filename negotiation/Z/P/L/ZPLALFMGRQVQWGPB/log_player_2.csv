"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's too risky to accept at this point. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product, but my budget is around $10,000. Let's start with an offer of $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above your budget. While it's closer to your maximum, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to keep trying for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a little over budget.  Let's try $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit on this sale. Let's compromise at $14,500. This would give you a good deal and would allow me to sell at a price that's closer to what I need. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You have 5 more rounds and can likely negotiate a lower price. You're still better off trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This price would give us both a reasonable deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
