"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer.  However, this sets the stage for negotiation and shows I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm not sure how much longer Bob will continue to negotiate, so I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'm keeping the option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is also the price John is offering, so if Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  He's not budging much, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to move on."
