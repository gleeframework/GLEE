"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation to get an even better price.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Moving to the next round allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  How about $850,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and at $875,000, Bob is getting a good deal.  While there's always the chance of getting an even lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially losing the deal altogether is high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
