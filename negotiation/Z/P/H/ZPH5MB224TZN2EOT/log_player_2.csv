"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice has come down to $11,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll become less willing to negotiate, and I might end up paying closer to John's price anyway. Accepting $11,000 secures a decent discount."
