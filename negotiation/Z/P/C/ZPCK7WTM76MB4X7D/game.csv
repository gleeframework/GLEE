"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth $150 to you. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $130, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",125.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $125, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already made a few concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and consider other options. I'll let you know if anything changes.",150.0,Alice,7,
