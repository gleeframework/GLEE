I've assessed its worth in the current market, and I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,050,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want a price that reflects the product's worth, but I still think $1,050,000 is a good starting point. However, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. Holding firm for now keeps the possibility of a higher price on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be fair, I'm also willing to adjust my position. Let's settle this at $1,090,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,090,000, which would be $1,082,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,082,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,082,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, he's consistently moving upwards and we're now at a price that represents a significant profit ($82,500) above our guaranteed offer from John. It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
