Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still below my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This price allows for some negotiation without dropping below my minimum.
* **Positive and inviting tone:** I'm aiming to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiations or if it's better to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for better price:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

* **I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.** I'll try to find a middle ground that's more appealing to him while still maximizing my profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the significant value of this product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within the range:** My counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting that this price still provides a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm ending the message on a positive note, suggesting a willingness to continue negotiations if necessary.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to weigh whether to lower my price further or go with John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of losing a lot of money is high.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is a reliable buyer, and his offer is guaranteed.  There's no risk involved in selling to him.
* **Time is money:** Continuing negotiations with Bob could drag on, potentially costing me time and ultimately leading to a lower price.

**Next steps:**

* **I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000.** This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids further risk."
