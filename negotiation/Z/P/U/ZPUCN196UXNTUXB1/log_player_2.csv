"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:** Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than what you'd pay John ($1,500,000). 
* **You still get a good deal:**  While Alice is getting a better price than her minimum, you're still getting the product for under your maximum budget."
