I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as much as possible.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and we're already at round 4.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
