Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob may counteroffer.  I'm also aware that John is a safety net at $800,000, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $1,000,000 by making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my profit and I'm not in a rush to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my desired price, and I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, Bob might walk away and I'd be left with only John's offer of $800,000.  It's better to secure a deal that's almost what I want than risk losing the deal altogether."
