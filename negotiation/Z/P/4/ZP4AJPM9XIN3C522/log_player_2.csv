"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $8,500. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and closer to my maximum budget of $8,000. It leaves room for potential negotiation, but it's a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, as it guarantees a purchase within my budget.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether."
