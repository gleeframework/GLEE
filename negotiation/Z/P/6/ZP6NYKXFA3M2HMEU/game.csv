"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $125, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still above my budget. Let's try $140. It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet at $150? It's my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,7,
