This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will recognize the value and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, considering its value to me. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident he values the product enough to continue negotiating. I'll counter with a lower price, but one that's still significantly higher than my minimum."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not ready to accept it.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'll need to be careful not to go too low.  I'll aim for a price that's still significantly higher than my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I've already made several concessions, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further. 

To avoid risking a long negotiation that might not result in a good deal for me, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly better than my minimum, and it guarantees me a sale without further risk."
