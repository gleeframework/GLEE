"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for something that's worth a lot more to me! What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to go as high as $650,000.  I think that's a fair deal considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this work.  This is a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really driving a hard bargain! I can appreciate the value you place on the product, but I have a budget to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  That's the best I can do.",812500.0,Bob,6,
