Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below my minimum of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** A $95 offer provides room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is guaranteed, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially get closer to my ideal price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will now counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $85, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you. While $85 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $90. This still gives me a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $85 and my previous offer of $95. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $90 is still above my minimum of $100, ensuring I'm getting a worthwhile price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to keep the negotiation focused on its worth. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation. If his counteroffer is too low, I might choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I'm still a bit away. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is closer to my minimum of $100, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a better price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is guaranteed, I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to try and get closer to my ideal price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $87.50, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? That way we both get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $87.50 and my previous offer of $90. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While $88.50 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that reduces the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fair deal"" to encourage acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a price that's not far off my ideal, and I've successfully negotiated. 
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I will seriously consider John's offer of $100.  The risk of further negotiation is now high, and it's getting increasingly difficult to justify going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob has stubbornly stuck to his offer of $87.50, and I'm unwilling to go any lower. 
* **Low Return:**  Accepting $87.50 would result in a significantly lower profit than John's offer of $100. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might walk away completely, leaving me with no sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit of $100, which is more than what I can reasonably expect from Bob.  It's time to move on and close the deal."
