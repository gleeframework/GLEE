"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a steal considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to make it seem like a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away if his offers aren't close enough to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for something more within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1500000? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, I can:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to go higher. 
* **Gain leverage:**  Demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at that price. 
* **Maximize my profit:** Potentially earn more than the minimum amount. 

I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer, trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe this product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  How about $1,750,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns to show I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the slightly higher price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your offer and would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than my minimum, and I'm confident that I can still make a good profit. I'm also getting a better price than I would from John.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
