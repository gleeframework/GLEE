Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum ($80) but leaves room for potential negotiation and still provides a good value for Bob.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get closer to my target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me closer to my initial offer and potential profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $92 is slightly less than my target, it's still a better deal than selling to John and it's likely that we'll be stuck in a loop of counteroffers if I reject."
