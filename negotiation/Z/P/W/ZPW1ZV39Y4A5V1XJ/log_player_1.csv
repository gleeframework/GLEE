Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You've set your minimum at $10,000, so this offer gives you some wiggle room to potentially accept a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not overly aggressive, giving Bob the chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This approach allows you to start the negotiation with a good offer while still leaving room to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is above Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.  It's worth trying to push for a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if I don't get a suitable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I increase the chances of getting a more favorable outcome without sacrificing too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll take $9,000 for it? That way we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** By offering $9,000, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while staying above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on finding a solution that benefits both of us, which can be persuasive.
* **Direct and clear:** The offer is straightforward and easy to understand.

This approach balances firmness with flexibility, giving Bob a chance to accept a price that's still advantageous to me while demonstrating that I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I've already rejected two offers from Bob and it seems he's not willing to go any higher.  Instead of continuing to negotiate and potentially get stuck in a stalemate, I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price.  It's more efficient to take the guaranteed offer from John and move on."
