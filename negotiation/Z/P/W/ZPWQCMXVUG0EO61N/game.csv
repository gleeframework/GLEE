"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a decision, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",8500.0,Alice,5,
