Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him ($800,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  A $1,100,000 sale is a significant profit for me.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to negotiate upwards from his initial valuation, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain a backup option:**  I'm still able to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By starting with a high offer, I'm leaving room for potential concessions if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm also confident that I can likely get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm:

* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if I don't get a better price.
* **Preserving potential for a higher price:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired amount. 

While selling to John immediately would guarantee a higher price, I'm choosing to risk further negotiation with Bob, hoping to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Mid-point compromise:** This offer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. It signals a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Appealing to Bob's valuation:** While $1,000,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to him, it's closer to his valuation than my previous offer. This might make him more likely to accept. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount, demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

This strategy aims to find a sweet spot that balances my need for a high profit with the potential for a successful agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I've already made concessions, and there's a risk of continued back and forth with Bob without reaching a mutually agreeable price. 

Considering John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, it's a wiser decision to sell the product to John. This guarantees the best possible outcome for me, ensuring a sale at a price that meets my financial goals."
