"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we discuss a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. Considering my costs and the market value, I suggest we aim for a price around $9,500. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think, and we can proceed with further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
