Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,200,000 if you sell to John. 
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product.

This offer allows you to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, or if he'll simply reject and you can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You're in a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $950,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Moves closer to Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** It's still above Bob's offer, so there's potential for further concessions.
* **Maintains a strong position:** You're still getting a price that's closer to your ideal price and better than selling to John.

Let's see if this counteroffer is enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's time to take the deal. While $925,000 isn't your ideal price, it's still a significant profit and a better outcome than selling to John.  You've shown flexibility and willingness to compromise, and the negotiations have reached a point where further back and forth might risk losing the deal altogether."
