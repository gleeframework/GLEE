"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
