Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly below my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but not desperate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $12,000 to him, making my offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By starting at $14,000, I'm giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, which keeps the negotiation open and avoids a quick rejection.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low counteroffer. I can always walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Above My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a slightly better price.
* **Potential for a Better Counter:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to $14,000. There's a chance Bob might be willing to meet me halfway.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** I have a guaranteed alternative with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a price I'm not happy with.

**Next Step:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise, but still closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still remaining close to my desired price point.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making my price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message to keep the negotiation open and encourage further discussion. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I have John's offer as a backup if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your original asking price, but I'm not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price of $13,000.
* **No Significant Upside:** While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob would budge further. The negotiation could drag on, and I risk losing the sale altogether.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me the confidence to accept this offer. I'm not desperate, and I'm getting a good price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with minimal risk and a price that's close to my minimum."
