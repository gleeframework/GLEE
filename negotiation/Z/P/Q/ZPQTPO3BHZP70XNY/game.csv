"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. How about we meet at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
