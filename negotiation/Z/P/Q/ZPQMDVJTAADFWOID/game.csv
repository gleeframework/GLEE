"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I'd like to discuss the price further to ensure it's within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $1050000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, so I'd like to offer $1025000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if you accept it.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your creative approach to finding a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1025000, which would be $1037500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
