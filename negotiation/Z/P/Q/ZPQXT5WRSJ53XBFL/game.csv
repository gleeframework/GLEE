"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal and worth much more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good price.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in buying it from you.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. That's my final offer, so let me know if you can accept it.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $87.50 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us close the deal. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really close to buying from someone else. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",85.0,Bob,8,
