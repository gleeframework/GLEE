"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $100. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can come to an agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $87.50 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really close to buying from someone else. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, but it's clear we're not going to agree on a price that's good for me.  I've got a guaranteed offer from John for $100, and it's time to take it."
