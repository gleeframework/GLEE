"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to come down a bit.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000? That's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,750 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I suggest you accept this offer. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,900 is still a bit too high. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",8800.0,Bob,6,
