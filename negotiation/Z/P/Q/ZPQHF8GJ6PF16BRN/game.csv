"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000. Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
