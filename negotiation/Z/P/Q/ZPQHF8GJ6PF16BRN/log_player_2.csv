Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

It's time to switch to John. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500, and you can get the product for $10,000 from John. This saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
