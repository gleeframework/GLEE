"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that is valued at $15,000 by you, and we believe this price reflects its true worth while leaving some room for negotiation. We look forward to discussing this further with you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,500. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still leaves a significant margin for negotiation and I believe it reflects the value of the item while being more accommodating to your budget.",11000.0,Alice,3,
