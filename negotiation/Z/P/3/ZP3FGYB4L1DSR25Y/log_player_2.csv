"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer you a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's initial offer is above your desired price point. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and I want to avoid buying from John if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $800,000. This is a price I feel is fair and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, and I'd rather not let the deal slip away. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise and is close to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  While I could continue negotiating, I think accepting this offer is the best option."
