"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer you a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $800,000. This is a price I feel is fair and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, and I'd rather not let the deal slip away. Let's try to meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
