{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,350,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 to John gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can confidently aim high.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential value"" and ""significant benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the high price. 

By starting with a strong offer, you increase the chances of securing a deal closer to your desired outcome."
