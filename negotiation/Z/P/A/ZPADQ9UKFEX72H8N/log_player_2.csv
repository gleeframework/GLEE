"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better deal than Alice's original asking price of $15,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth exploring further negotiations to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum limit of $12,000.  Offering $12,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to buy while also leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's limit but still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  This is a good deal for Bob, especially considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product from Alice. Buying from John for $12,000 is the ideal scenario, but the risk of further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome. It's important to weigh the risk vs. reward and accept the current offer."
