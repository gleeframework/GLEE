"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $95?  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $98?  That's my final offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to budge much more, Bob. I can do $108, but that's really my final offer. I've already lost some profit by not selling to John earlier.",108.0,Alice,7,
