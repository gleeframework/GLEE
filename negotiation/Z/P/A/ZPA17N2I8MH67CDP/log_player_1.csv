I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. There are only a few rounds left, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

We are in the 8th round, and Bob has not moved from his previous offer.  While I'd like to get more than $1,500,000, it's clear Bob is not going to go higher. I'm going to sell to John and be done with this negotiation."
