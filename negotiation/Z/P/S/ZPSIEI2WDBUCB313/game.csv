"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm still a bit away from my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle at $9,000? I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll get a great value at that price. If you're still not comfortable, we can explore other options, but I truly believe this is a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
