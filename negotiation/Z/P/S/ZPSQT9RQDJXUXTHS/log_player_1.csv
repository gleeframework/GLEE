Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're leaving room for negotiation, while still getting a good return.
* **It's less than the product's value to Bob:** This incentivizes him to accept the deal rather than risking losing the product altogether.
* **It establishes a clear starting point:**  This allows Bob to understand your expectations and make a counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
