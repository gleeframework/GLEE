"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500 for the product. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,5,
