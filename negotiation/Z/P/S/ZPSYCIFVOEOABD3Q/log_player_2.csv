# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

I'm thinking of a price of $11,500 for the product. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go below $11,500.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is your maximum price. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and go with John."
