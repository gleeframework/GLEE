"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.
