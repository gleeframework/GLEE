"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
