"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I could do $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
