"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's important to start negotiating and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is far above my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is a reduction from her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
