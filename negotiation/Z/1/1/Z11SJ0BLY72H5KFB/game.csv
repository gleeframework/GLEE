"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still  looking to pay closer to $80.  Would you consider $90? This would be a fair deal for both of us. ",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to pay closer to $80, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which would be $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference again.  Would you consider $95? That feels like a good compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, which would be $97.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,7,
