"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $152. This is as low as I'm willing to go, though. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",145.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'd be happy to make a purchase.",130.0,Bob,8,
