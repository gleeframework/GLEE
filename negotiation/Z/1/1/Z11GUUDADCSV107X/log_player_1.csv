"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob to make him think about its worth to him. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while setting a high initial price to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John is a backup:**  While I'm open to negotiation with Bob, I have a guaranteed alternative with John for $100, which I can utilize if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but showing flexibility by proposing a counteroffer that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum price.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product to try and make Bob see its worth.
* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise, which might encourage Bob to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $75? That's a fair offer, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, given his previous willingness to compromise.
* **John is a Backup:** I have a guaranteed alternative with John for $100, which I can utilize if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target. How about $85? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and moving closer to his price, but still above my minimum.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finding a Solution:** I'm emphasizing a desire to reach a solution that benefits both of us to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $80?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:**  $80 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. However, I've already made several concessions and I'm concerned that further negotiation could lower the price even further.
* **Risk of Counteroffer:** There's a risk that Bob will counter with a lower offer again, and I'm hesitant to continue the negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed sale at $100, ensuring I meet my minimum goal and avoid the potential for a lower price. 
* **Time is Limited:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.

Given these factors, selling to John is the most pragmatic decision to ensure I get the best possible price for the product within the limited timeframe."
