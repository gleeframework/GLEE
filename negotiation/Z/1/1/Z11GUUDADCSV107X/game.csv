"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. ",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $75? That's a fair offer, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target. How about $85? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
