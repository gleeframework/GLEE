"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price range.  I want to see if I can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is my minimum price. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer hasn't changed from the first round.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's still above my ideal range.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to buying from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's closer to my ideal price, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also getting closer to buying from John if this doesn't work out.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm preparing to move on to John if this doesn't get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, and $1150000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1250000, which is $1200000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer hasn't changed from previous rounds. While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm still not ready to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to consider one more counteroffer before I seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal, but I'm really not able to go higher. Let's see if we can finally close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not convinced that $1175000 is enough for me to sell the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has actually gone up!  We've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to get me the price I want.  Considering I only have one round left, and John is offering a product that I'm willing to buy for $1,500,000, it's time to move on. Buying from John is the best option at this point."
