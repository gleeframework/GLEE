"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great price for a product that's worth so much to you. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop to $8,750.  This price is still fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
