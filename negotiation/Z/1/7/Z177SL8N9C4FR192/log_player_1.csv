"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great price for a product that's worth so much to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to go above $8,000. I think $9,000 is still too high for me. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied. I've only got 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate yet. I'm confident that I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop to $8,750.  This price is still fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,500 or am I going to have to walk away? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm on his price of $8,500.  While I've gotten close to my minimum acceptable value, it's getting risky to continue. We're nearing the end of the rounds, and there's a good chance Bob won't budge.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to sell to John at $10,000."
