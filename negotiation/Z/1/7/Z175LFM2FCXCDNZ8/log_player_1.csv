Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This price is within my budget and reflects what I believe the product is worth to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll meet my minimum requirement of $1,500,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
