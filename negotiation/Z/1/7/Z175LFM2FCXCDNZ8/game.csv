"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This price is within my budget and reflects what I believe the product is worth to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,900,000 represents a significant compromise on my end.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the product's true value and potential for return. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I can only consider an offer at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
