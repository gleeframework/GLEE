"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a more reasonable price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. While $1,100,000 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting my offer again, and potentially ending up with a higher price or needing to buy from John for $1,500,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a decent price without risking a worse outcome."
