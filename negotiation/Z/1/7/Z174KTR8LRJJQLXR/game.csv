"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking this product is a great fit for me. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $16,500 is closer, it's still a little out of my price range. My absolute maximum is $15,500. If you're willing to come down to that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,500 is your maximum, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. It's a small increase from your maximum, but I think it's worth considering. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
