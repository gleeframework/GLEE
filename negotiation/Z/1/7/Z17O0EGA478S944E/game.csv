"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
