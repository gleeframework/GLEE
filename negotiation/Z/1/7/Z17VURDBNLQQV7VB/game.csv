"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows me a decent profit while ensuring you get a great value.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
