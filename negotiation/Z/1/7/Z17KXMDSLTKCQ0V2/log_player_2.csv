"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $100? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  You're willing to spend up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100.
* **You save money:** You save $20 compared to buying from John. 

While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
