"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This is a fair starting point given my limitations.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value you've described.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
