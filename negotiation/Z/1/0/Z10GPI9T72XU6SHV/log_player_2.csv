"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that. How about $8,500? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's only $250 more than Bob's counteroffer and it's still below Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to buy from John for a higher price."
