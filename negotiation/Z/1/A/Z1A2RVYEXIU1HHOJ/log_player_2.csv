"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. We have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We want to start with a significant counteroffer, showing Alice that we're serious about negotiating.  $1,300,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to our ideal price, we still have room to negotiate.  Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to move, so we should push further to see if we can get a lower price. We've only had 3 rounds so far, leaving plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,325,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've shown Alice we're serious about getting a better price.  This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It's still a good deal for Alice, and it keeps us within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is a great price for us. It's only $20,000 above our last counteroffer, and we've already shown a willingness to compromise.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential for Alice to increase the price again.  Furthermore, buying from John would cost us $180,000 more."
