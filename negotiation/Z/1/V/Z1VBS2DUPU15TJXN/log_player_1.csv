"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest.  He might be willing to pay a premium, or this could be a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

With only two rounds left, Bob is unlikely to raise his offer further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I didn't get the best price, it's still a good deal."
