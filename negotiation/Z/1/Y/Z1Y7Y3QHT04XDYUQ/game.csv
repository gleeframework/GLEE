"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is closer, but I'm still struggling to justify that price.  How about $1150000?  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
