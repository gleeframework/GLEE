"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer and his own desired price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer, which suggests she's not willing to budge much. However, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still potential for negotiation, as Bob can try to get closer to his desired price of $850,000. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, aiming to find a middle ground with Alice. This offer is a good compromise as it is halfway between Bob's previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much lower than $950,000.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't be able to get the product for a price he's comfortable with.  Given that John is selling the product for $1,000,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  While it's not ideal, it's the best way to ensure Bob gets the product while limiting his losses."
