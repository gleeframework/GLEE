"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000.  I think its value will become clear during our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You want to save as much money as possible and have ten rounds to negotiate. It's better to start with a counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects a substantial investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, and you can always buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product. I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
