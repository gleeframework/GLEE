"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product. I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
