"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay Alice $99."
