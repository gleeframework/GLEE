"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $975,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,012,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
