"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see great value in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $1,200,000, Bob can do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  I understand the value of this product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's start with $850,000."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a lower counteroffer than the previous offer, aiming to push Alice closer to his target price.  $850,000 is a significant drop from the initial offer, and allows for potential negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and Bob has the option to buy from John if he doesn't get a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to slowly decrease the price while remaining within a reasonable range. By suggesting a middle ground at $900,000, Bob demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price. This strategy aims to build momentum towards his target price without risking a stalemate or losing the deal completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but I need to be closer to $950,000.  Let's meet halfway at $925,000.  This gives us both a fair price and allows us to move forward with this transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within striking distance of his target price of $800,000. While $925,000 is tempting,  it's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price. With several rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm willing to go slightly higher, but $925,000 is still too far from my budget. Let's meet at $910,000. This offers a fair compromise and brings us closer to a final agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to chip away at the price, making a small but significant move towards his target. By offering $910,000, he demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his budget. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while putting pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $910,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again and go with $917,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there are still a few rounds remaining.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price.  Bob is still within a range that allows for further negotiation without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $917,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's compromise again and go with $912,500. This would allow us to finalize this deal fairly and quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 912500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to inch closer to his target price by offering $912,500. This is a compromise, showing that he is willing to meet halfway with Alice's latest offer. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward and puts pressure on Alice to concede further, as there are only two rounds left."
