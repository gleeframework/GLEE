"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  I understand the value of this product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's start with $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but I need to be closer to $950,000.  Let's meet halfway at $925,000.  This gives us both a fair price and allows us to move forward with this transaction.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm willing to go slightly higher, but $925,000 is still too far from my budget. Let's meet at $910,000. This offers a fair compromise and brings us closer to a final agreement. What do you think?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $910,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again and go with $917,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to finally close this deal. What do you say?",917500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $917,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's compromise again and go with $912,500. This would allow us to finalize this deal fairly and quickly. What do you say?",912500.0,Bob,8,
