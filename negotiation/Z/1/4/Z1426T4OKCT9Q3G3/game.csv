"I appreciate your interest, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",100.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $95. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $98, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me see... How about I throw in an additional feature that's worth $10 to you, and I'll sell it to you for $108?",108.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate the extra feature you're offering, but $108 is still a bit too high for me.  If you're willing to drop the price to $100, I'll take it.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,110.0
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot by throwing in another feature that's worth $5 to you. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,9,,
