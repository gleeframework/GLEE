"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $112.50? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $110.  Let's split the difference and call it a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I think we were close at $112.50, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $111.50? That's the best I can do.",111.5,Alice,5,,
