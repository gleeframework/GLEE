"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. It's worth a lot more to you, so I think it's a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, which is a good negotiation tactic. 
* I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion."

Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer. I would like to propose $105 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is getting close to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can squeeze out much more. It's important to remember that there are 6 rounds left and I could end up with nothing if I keep rejecting offers.  $105 is a good compromise and a reasonable profit."
