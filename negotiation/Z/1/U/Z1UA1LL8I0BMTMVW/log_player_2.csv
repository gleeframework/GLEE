"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, but you want to save money. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere before resorting to John's offer."
