Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high ($925,000) leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle on a price significantly higher than $800,000.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""incredibly valuable to you"") helps justify the high price, making it more likely he'll seriously consider the offer."
