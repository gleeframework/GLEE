"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If this works for you, we can finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
