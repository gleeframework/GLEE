"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's worth while still leaving a comfortable margin for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. While $1,075,000 is a decent profit, there's still room to negotiate for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's settle this at $1,090,000. This is a final offer, reflecting the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, it's strategic to convey a sense of finality while still leaving room for a slight concession if Bob counters. The message aims to nudge Bob towards a decision while securing a price significantly higher than John's offer."
