"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate while still being above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm ready to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $160. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is getting closer to what I want, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that isn't satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140.  I'm running out of rounds and need to be realistic about what I can get from Bob. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd like to get closer to $150, I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price I'm unhappy with. Selling to John is the safest and most reliable option at this point."
