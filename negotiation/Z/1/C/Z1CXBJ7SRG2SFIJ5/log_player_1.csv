"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit higher than my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also including a friendly message to establish rapport and show that I'm open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more. I will counteroffer in the next round to try and close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $150 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $175 to make this deal happen. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $160 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my preferred price than John's offer of $150. It's worth accepting this deal to get a slightly higher price and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed sale."
