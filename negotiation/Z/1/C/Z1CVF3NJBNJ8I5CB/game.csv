"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects a compromise on my part, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still can't justify spending more than $750,000 on this product. I'm prepared to offer $760,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value you're providing. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $760,000 is still too far below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $790,000, and I truly believe this is a fair compromise given the value you're seeking.  This is my final offer. ",790000.0,Alice,5,
