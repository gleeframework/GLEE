"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:** My message emphasizes being open to negotiation, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This initial offer gives Bob space to counter without feeling like he's being pressured. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $14,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I have several rounds left, and I can likely negotiate a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I'm not desperate to sell yet and can explore a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** My counteroffer is lower than my initial price but still above Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob why $13,000 is a fair price.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground with Bob while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob has moved closer to my price, there's still room for a better deal.
* **John's Offer is a Safe Option:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, but I'm not desperate yet and want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's, showing a genuine willingness to find a compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:** My message emphasizes that $12,000 is a fair price for both of us, making it easier for Bob to accept.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't settle for a loss. 

This approach aims to pressure Bob into accepting, as he's already shown a willingness to compromise."
