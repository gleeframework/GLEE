"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
