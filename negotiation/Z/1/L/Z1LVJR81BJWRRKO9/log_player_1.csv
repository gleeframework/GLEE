Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give insight into his level of interest and price sensitivity.  
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You might be willing to go slightly lower than $15,000, but remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the deal is fair for both parties."
