"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,750? I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",15750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $16,200. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",16200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $16,200 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us. How about $15,900? I believe this would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",15900.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer again. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $15,900. I'm thinking of a price of $16,100. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product.",16100.0,Alice,7,
