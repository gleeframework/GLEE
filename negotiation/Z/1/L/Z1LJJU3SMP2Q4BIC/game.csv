"I'm really interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can we meet in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $19000, but I really think that's the maximum I can afford. Can we meet at $19000?",19000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $19000, but I need to add a small premium for the product's rarity and value. I'll sell it to you for $19500. It's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, Alice, but $19500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can we really meet at $19000?",19000.0,Bob,6,
