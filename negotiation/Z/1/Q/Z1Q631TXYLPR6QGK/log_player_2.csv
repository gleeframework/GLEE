"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire this unique product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still relatively high. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.  It's possible Alice is overvaluing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not simply accepting her first offer. This price is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. It's still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of the product, $825,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my initial strategy of lowering the price by significant increments.  $750,000 is a good midpoint between our current positions and shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway.  This offer also leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $775,000, which is close to my last counteroffer. I'm happy with this price and believe it's a fair deal. It's also much lower than the $1,000,000 I'd have to pay John, so it's a significant saving.  There's always a risk that I could negotiate further and get an even lower price, but the possibility of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John for a higher price is a risk I'm not willing to take."
