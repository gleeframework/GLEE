"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
