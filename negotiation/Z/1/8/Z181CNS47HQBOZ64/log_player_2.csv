Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is within my budget and ultimately saves me money compared to Alice's current offer."
