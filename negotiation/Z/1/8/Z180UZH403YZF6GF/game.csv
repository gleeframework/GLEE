"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9250. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,
