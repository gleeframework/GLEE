"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This reflects its true worth while still offering you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
