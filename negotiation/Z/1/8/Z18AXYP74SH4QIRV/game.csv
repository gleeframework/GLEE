"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
