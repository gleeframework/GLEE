Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob. It gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's my minimum value, it's still a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, potentially ending with a worse outcome.  It's also better than selling to John for the same amount, as I would prefer to sell the product to Bob."
