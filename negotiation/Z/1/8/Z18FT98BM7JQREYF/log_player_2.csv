"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a product worth $12,000 to you for less, and I get a price higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay $12,000, but John will sell it to you at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or simply buying it from John for $12,000."
