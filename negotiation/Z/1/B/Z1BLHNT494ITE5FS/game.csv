"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for countering.  I'm happy to meet somewhere in the middle, but $140 is still pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?",115.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Alice,5,,
