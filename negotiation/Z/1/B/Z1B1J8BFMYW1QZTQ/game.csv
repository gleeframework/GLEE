"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $80.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that.",80.0,Bob,4,
