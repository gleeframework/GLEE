Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's a bit lower than my minimum price of $15,000, leaving some room for negotiation.  It's also high enough that Bob might be willing to accept, as it's still below his perceived value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping that this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still allowing me to make a profit closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is too low. It's below my minimum price and the negotiations are not moving in the right direction. I've reached a point where I'm comfortable selling to John for $15,000, which is a good price for me."
