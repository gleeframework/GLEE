Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Accepting his offer is a significant loss, so it's more profitable to sell to John at $15,000."
