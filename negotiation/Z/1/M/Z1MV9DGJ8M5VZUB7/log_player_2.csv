"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $95. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $100. There's room for negotiation, so reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $92 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still willing to pay a bit more than Alice's offer, and you're getting closer to your target price of $90. Reject the offer and try to get a little closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $92 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $91.  Would you be willing to come down just a little more?"", ""product_price"": 91}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $91.50 for the product. This would be the best price I can offer considering its value and market positioning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've managed to get the price down to $91.50, which is only $1.50 more than your initial counteroffer of $90.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will just drag things out and you might end up paying more. Accept the offer and move on."
