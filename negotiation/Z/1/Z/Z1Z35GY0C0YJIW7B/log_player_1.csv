{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.  However, it's not too far off to make him immediately reject the deal. I'm also being friendly and building rapport to create a more positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I would like to sell the product, $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,500 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower price."
