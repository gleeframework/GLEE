Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the $5."
