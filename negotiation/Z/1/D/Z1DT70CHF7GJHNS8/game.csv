"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate that.  However,  $10,200 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, my maximum limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its true value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
