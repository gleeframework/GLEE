"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my means.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession - how about we settle on $9,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also recognizing your budget.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
