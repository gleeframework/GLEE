Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that you're willing to work with Bob to reach a deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer, allowing you to negotiate further.

If Bob rejects the offer, you'll have to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of your own.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if you feel the negotiation is not going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum value of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap. You've already established a willingness to negotiate, and rejecting this offer shows that you're not afraid to stand your ground.  

In the next round, you can propose a price closer to your desired value while still demonstrating flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is strategically positioned:

* **Meeting in the middle:** It's a compromise, suggesting flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Still above your minimum:**  It keeps your profit margin above your $10,000 minimum.
* **Reiterating the value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, reminding Bob of the benefits he'll gain. 

This approach gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate, while also asserting your position and maintaining your desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  There's still room to negotiate, and you can explore a counteroffer that might push him closer to your desired price point. 

You've demonstrated flexibility in your previous rounds, and this shows that you're determined to get a fair deal.  By rejecting his offer, you maintain your position and encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession - how about we settle on $9,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also recognizing your budget.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Final concession:**  The message indicates a willingness to compromise, implying that this is your best offer.
* **Bridging the gap:**  It's a slight increase from your previous offer but still significantly lower than your minimum.
* **Highlighting the win-win:**  The message emphasizes that a deal at this price is beneficial for both parties.

This counteroffer positions you for a potential agreement, leaving Bob with a decision to make. If he's serious about acquiring the product, he may be willing to meet you in the middle.  However, if he rejects this offer, you can confidently move on to sell to John."
