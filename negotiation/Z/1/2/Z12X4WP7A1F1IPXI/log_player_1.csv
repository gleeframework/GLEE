Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,000 is still above your minimum of $10,000, so you're not losing money. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price provides room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

It's also important to consider:

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a higher price.
* **The time constraint:** If you need to sell quickly, you might be willing to accept a lower price.

By starting with this offer, you're setting a fair starting point and maximizing your chances of getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum and only slightly above the value Bob has for the product.  I need to try to get a better price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $7,500 just isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $7,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my minimum of $10,000, Bob's offer of $8,000 is a good compromise. It's above his initial offer and is within a reasonable range.  It's important to consider that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, and selling to John for $10,000 is always an option.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and keeps the process moving forward."
