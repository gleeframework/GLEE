"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is still above your last offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate in good faith.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but we're getting closer to a point where it's not worth continuing this negotiation.  I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500, which is a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
