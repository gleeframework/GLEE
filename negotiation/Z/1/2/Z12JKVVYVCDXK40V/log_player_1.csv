Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's drastically lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to sell it for a price that's too far below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is still above your last offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate in good faith.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $987,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $987,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I want. I'm going to keep pushing for a price closer to my value. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us with a little more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but we're getting closer to a point where it's not worth continuing this negotiation.  I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500, which is a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $996,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $996,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $996,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting very close to my minimum, but it's clear that Bob is not going to go significantly higher.  With only three rounds left, I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value, and it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower price."
