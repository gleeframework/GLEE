Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers the full $1,000,000, Alice's minimum selling price to Bob should be close to that amount.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" are used to create a sense of urgency and potentially persuade Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to be aware that this strategy carries the (low) risk of Bob rejecting the offer, leading Alice to sell to John at the maximum price. However, it maximizes the potential profit if Bob accepts."
