Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum price point.  My counteroffer is $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  While it's closer, it's worth continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and my counteroffer is $1,200,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, as it's the minimum I can accept. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's the best offer I've received so far and it's the same price as buying from John. I'll accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
