"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum price point.  My counteroffer is $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and my counteroffer is $1,200,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, as it's the minimum I can accept. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
