"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints but $12,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for me. How about $13,500? ",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $16,000. I think that's a very fair offer considering the value you'll be getting.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $14,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really close.  How about we split the difference and make it $15,000 even?  That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,7,
