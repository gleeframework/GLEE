"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly lower than that, but still allows me a fair return on my investment.  Let's talk about a price of $950,000.  This is a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Alice's asking price of $950,000 is still a bit steep. I'd like to explore other options.
