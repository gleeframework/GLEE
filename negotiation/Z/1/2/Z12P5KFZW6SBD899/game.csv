"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the item and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the item to me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is still a good price for me, considering the value of the item to me is $15,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm firm on my last offer of $14,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's seal the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to accept $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,7,
