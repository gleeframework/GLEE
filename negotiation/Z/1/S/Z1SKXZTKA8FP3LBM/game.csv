"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's on offer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only go as high as $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your potential returns. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,500,000.  This price allows both of us to make a decent profit and ensures a successful transaction.  I'm confident this is a fair offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
