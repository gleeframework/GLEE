"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's on offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate negotiations and attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only go as high as $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your potential returns. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still beyond Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further. There's still room for Alice to make concessions, and Bob doesn't want to miss out on potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,500,000.  This price allows both of us to make a decent profit and ensures a successful transaction.  I'm confident this is a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
