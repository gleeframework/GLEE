"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion. How about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is still below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $11500. This would be a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
