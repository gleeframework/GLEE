"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
