{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects, but it also shows I'm serious about selling it to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still above my minimum acceptable price. However, there's still potential for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is the lowest I can go. Let's split the difference and make this happen.  "", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than John's offer of $80, and it's close enough to my initial target price that I'm happy to accept it."
