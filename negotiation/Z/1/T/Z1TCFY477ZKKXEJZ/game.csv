"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  That's a fair compromise and it gives you a great price on a valuable product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
