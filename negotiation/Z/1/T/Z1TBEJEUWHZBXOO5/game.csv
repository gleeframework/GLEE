,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1325000? This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
