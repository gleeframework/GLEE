"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum of $100, leaving room for negotiation. I'm optimistic Bob might be willing to pay a bit more since he values the product at $80.  I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum value of $100.  I'll counter with a lower price but still above $90, keeping the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $95 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $95, which is a compromise and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him, emphasizing the value he'll get from the product. I'm keeping the message friendly to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit shy of that price. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, $85 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll try to counter again, aiming for a price closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $90 for the product? This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great deal on a valuable product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing fairness to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. I'm also reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal on a valuable product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value, but not quite there yet. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of ending up with less than $100 is too high. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
