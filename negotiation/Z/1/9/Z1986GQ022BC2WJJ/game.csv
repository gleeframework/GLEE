"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value and allows me to make this investment work for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
