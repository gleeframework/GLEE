"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $170. There's no way you'll accept that offer. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is your best shot at getting the product for your desired price. You're offering the minimum you're willing to pay, and Alice might be willing to accept to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. You can try to get a lower price by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

You're offering a slightly higher price than your initial offer, but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is tempting, you still have time and a backup option. You can try to negotiate further, but if Alice doesn't budge, buying from John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

You're getting closer to Alice's price, but still trying to save some money. This counteroffer shows your willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd ideally like to pay less, $125 is a good compromise. You're still saving $25 compared to John's offer, and with only a few rounds left, it's worth securing the deal before potentially running out of time."
