"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and negotiating a lower price is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob is still trying to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
