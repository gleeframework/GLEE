Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so this gives him room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  It ensures you don't undervalue the product and are still able to make a substantial profit.

This initial offer allows for negotiation and sets the stage for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial willingness to pay, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's current offer.  This keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still maintaining a price point that is above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired value. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000. The potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are not worth the risk of further time and effort, especially since I have a secure alternative buyer in John."
