"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
