Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, reflecting the product's value to me.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate. If he doesn't, I've earned a profit. If he does, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again, always keeping in mind John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not satisfied with that price.  I believe the product holds more value, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and secure a higher price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. $1,250,000 is still a significant profit for me, and I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to accept. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $950,000 is too far from my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 with John, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer."
