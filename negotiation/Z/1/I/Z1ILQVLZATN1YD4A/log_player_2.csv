"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, far exceeding its monetary worth. I'm confident that it can be a game-changer for your business, but I understand that you might not be aware of its full potential.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects its true value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1200000. So, you have the chance to secure a product that could be incredibly beneficial at a price that's potentially more advantageous for you. What do you say?
