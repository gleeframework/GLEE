Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price of $18,000. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, it's best to start high and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I've made it clear that I'm open to offers. This shows flexibility and makes Bob more likely to engage in a negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value (""amazing"") and the potential fit for Bob. This helps build interest.

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust based on Bob's response and keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value. While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $18,000 might be a bit high. However, I'm confident this product's value will exceed your expectations. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000? This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be happy to work with you."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** I've rejected Bob's offer, but I'm not giving up. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from $18,000 to $15,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially sway him. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and maintains a collaborative tone.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to see if he accepts my counteroffer. 
* If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stuck to his initial offer of $12,000.  At this point, it's clear that I won't be able to get more from Bob. I've already compromised once and still haven't reached a price I'm comfortable with. 

Rather than continue to negotiate and risk further rejection, it's better to accept the offer from John, which guarantees me my minimum value.  

**Key Point:** While it's always good to try to maximize profit, sometimes it's wiser to cut your losses and move on. In this case, continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a prolonged process with no guarantee of a better outcome."
