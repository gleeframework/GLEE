"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $925000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $925000. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $920000. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make this deal work, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, which is my previous offer. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",915000.0,Bob,6,
