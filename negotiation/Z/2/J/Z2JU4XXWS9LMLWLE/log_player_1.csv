Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $120 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is inclined to bargain. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and establishes the value proposition for Bob. It also frames the price as fair.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's perceived value for the product. By setting a slightly higher initial price, I leave room for negotiation while also potentially securing a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.** While it's tempting to accept, doing so would result in a loss for me.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.** I want to avoid selling to John if I can reach a better deal with Bob.

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly above his offer, but still below my desired price of $120. This allows for continued negotiation while preserving my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you're interested in the product. I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can agree on that?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $110, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and allows for potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is positive and reiterates the value proposition for Bob. It also uses the ""great deal"" phrasing to make the offer seem appealing. 

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with a price slightly above Bob's offer, I am demonstrating flexibility while also attempting to steer the negotiation closer to my desired price point. This strategy maintains a balance between potentially securing a better deal with Bob and preventing a sale to John at a lower price."
