Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still coming down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $810,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, pushing for a price closer to my ideal range."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $780,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm becoming more serious about closing a deal. It's also still a fair bit lower than her current offer, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a quick agreement."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is getting closer to my ideal price range.  While I'd prefer to push for a slightly lower price, I'm concerned that continuing to reject offers may lead to her hardening her stance or potentially even backing out of the negotiation entirely.  

This offer represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,000,000, and it's within the acceptable range I've set for myself. It's time to secure the deal."
