"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's a clear indication that she's starting high, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue exploring the possibility of a more favorable price."
