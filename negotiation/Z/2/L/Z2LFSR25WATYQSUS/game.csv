"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
