Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
