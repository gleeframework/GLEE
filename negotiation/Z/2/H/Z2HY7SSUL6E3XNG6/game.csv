"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  I'd like to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for both of us to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair market value, but I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the value I know you place on this product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
