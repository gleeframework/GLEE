"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a much better price.  Buying from John immediately would be a better option than accepting Alice's offer, but it's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above his maximum budget.  This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but he's also not willing to pay an exorbitant price.  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping the price within Bob's range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a price closer to his target.  Buying from John would be a safer option, but there's still potential to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of staying below $10,000, but is also trying to be flexible and meet Alice halfway.  Offering $15,000 shows that he is serious about negotiating a deal, but also that he won't be bullied into paying a price that's outside his range. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept a price that is still more profitable than selling to John."
