"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would be a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
