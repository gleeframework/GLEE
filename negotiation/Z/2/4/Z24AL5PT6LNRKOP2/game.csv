"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11500. It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
