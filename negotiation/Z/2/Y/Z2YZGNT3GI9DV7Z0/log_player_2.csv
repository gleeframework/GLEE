"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $150 is significantly more than his $80 limit. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with his absolute maximum price. There's no point in being more generous at this point, as he can always just buy from John for $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer of $140. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, he's still far below Alice's price point and within his budget. This strategy aims to find a compromise within a few rounds while keeping pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's $80 limit. While it's closer, there's still room to negotiate. Bob should continue to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. However, he's still aiming to get a better deal than $130.  He's hoping that Alice will recognize that he's serious about getting a deal, and will be more likely to accept a price closer to his range.  This is a strategic move to get closer to a compromise point, as he only has a few rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still too high for Bob. He's determined to save as much money as possible and knows he can always get the product for $80 from John. There are still a few rounds left, and he wants to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's still trying to get the best deal possible. He's increasing his offer again, but still keeping it below $120, the minimum Alice would likely accept. This is a strategic move to pressure Alice into accepting a deal that's more favorable to Bob. With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to be aggressive while still maintaining a realistic offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's limit, but it's still above his desired price.  With only one round left, the chance of negotiating a lower price is slim.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and pushed Alice down considerably, but it's likely Alice won't budge further.

Given this, the best option for Bob is to buy the product from John for $80.  This guarantees he gets the product at his target price and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
