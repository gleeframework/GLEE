"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it provides, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. It holds real value and I'm confident you'd find it useful. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm unable to meet the current price of $120. Could we perhaps aim for $95 as a compromise?",95.0,Bob,4,
