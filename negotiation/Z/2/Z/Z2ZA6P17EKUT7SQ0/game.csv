"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my assessment of its value, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my initial valuation for this deal to make sense. I can go as low as $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
