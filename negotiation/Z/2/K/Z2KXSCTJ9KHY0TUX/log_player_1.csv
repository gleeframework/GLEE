Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the maximum I know Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially avoiding a contentious start.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $100,000 gap allows for some back-and-forth without me having to immediately settle for a significantly lower price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to buy for $1,000,000 gives me a firm floor price, preventing me from accepting any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Better Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Again, I highlight the ""fairness"" of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintain a Margin:**  $1,300,000 is still above my minimum price, giving me some room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Setting the Stage for Agreement:** By coming down a bit, I'm aiming to signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, making him more likely to accept or counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to even lower offers, pushing me further below my desired price.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum requirement. This is a safer option than risking a further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't risk dropping below my minimum price. John offers a secure and reasonable alternative."
