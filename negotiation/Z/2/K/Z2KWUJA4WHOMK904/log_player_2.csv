The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she is offering it for $95. This means there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $100. It's a better offer than John's $100. Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a lower price."
