Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give away the product for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. I can't go as low as $90, but I'm willing to sell the product for $105. This is still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be realistic. I'm willing to drop my price to $102, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This price allows me to cover my costs while still giving you a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 102}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $98 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob's offer of $98 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough for me. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating and I'm not sure how much further I can go.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to take that option."
