Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This offers a significant profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
