"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and features.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the price. While $18,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $20,000? This still reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $17,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $19,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's a very fair price for a product of this quality.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $18,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",18750.0,Bob,6,
