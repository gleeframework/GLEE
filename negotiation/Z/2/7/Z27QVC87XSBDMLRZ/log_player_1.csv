Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking for $950,000, a price I believe reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $850,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about we settle on $900,000? This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. That's a fair price for both of us and lets us reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $875,000 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
