"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking for $950,000, a price I believe reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still too high, and there are more rounds of negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about we settle on $900,000? This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There are still many rounds left to try and reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. That's a fair price for both of us and lets us reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $875,000 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $887,500 is a good price for Bob, given his goal of saving as much money as possible. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This suggests that further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a deal is reached before needing to buy from John as a last resort. 

While Bob could potentially try to negotiate a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice becoming unwilling to compromise is too high. Accepting this offer is the most practical and financially beneficial choice at this point."
