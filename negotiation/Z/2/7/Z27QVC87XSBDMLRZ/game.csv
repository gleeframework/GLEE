"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking for $950,000, a price I believe reflects its worth. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about we settle on $900,000? This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. That's a fair price for both of us and lets us reach an agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $875,000 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
