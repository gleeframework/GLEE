"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a lot to me. My initial offer is $1800000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with given the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need at least $1650000 to consider it.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1650000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1650000, which would be $1575000. Would you be open to that?",1575000.0,Bob,4,
