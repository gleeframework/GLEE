"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your life.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18000 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and pay $16500.  Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16500 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $17000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
