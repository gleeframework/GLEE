"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Alice and $15,000 to you. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds:** You have time to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  You can always buy from John if you can't reach a better deal with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint offer:** This offer is exactly halfway between Alice's offer of $14,000 and your maximum price of $15,000. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Signal of seriousness:** By offering a price closer to Alice's, you show that you're serious about buying the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for Alice to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's still potential for a better deal.
* **You have time:** You're only in round 3, and you have 7 more rounds to negotiate.  
* **John's offer is your backup:** You can always buy from John if you can't get a better price from Alice.

By rejecting the offer again, you demonstrate your willingness to continue negotiating. You'll likely be able to secure a better price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental offer:** This offer is a $500 increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. 
* **Staying within your budget:** It's still within your budget of $15,000.
* **Potential for agreement:** This price might be more appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price of $12,000.

By increasing your offer slightly, you're showing flexibility while still pushing for a better price. This approach increases the chances of a successful negotiation within your desired price range."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum:**  Alice's offer is the same as John's offer, meaning there's no further room for negotiation with Alice. 
* **No advantage to continue:** Continuing with Alice would only waste time, as you're not likely to get a better price.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Buying from John secures the product at your maximum price, ensuring you don't lose out on the opportunity.

While you didn't get the best possible price, you're still securing the product within your budget and saving time by avoiding further negotiations."
