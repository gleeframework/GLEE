I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a good chance of getting a higher price than selling to John, while still being a reasonable offer. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Higher potential profit:**  $1,500,000 is significantly more than the $1,000,000 I'd get from John.
* **Not too high:**  It's not so high that Bob is likely to immediately reject it.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, we have room to negotiate down, and we can still potentially get a price higher than John's offer.

Let's see what Bob says!"
