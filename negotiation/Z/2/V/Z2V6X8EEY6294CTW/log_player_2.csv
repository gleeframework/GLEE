"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,150,000, while John is selling it for $1,200,000.
* **You want to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.

While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, that's irrelevant to your decision. You're focused on getting the best deal for yourself."
