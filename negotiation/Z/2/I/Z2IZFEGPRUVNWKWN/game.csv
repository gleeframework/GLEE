"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering its value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
