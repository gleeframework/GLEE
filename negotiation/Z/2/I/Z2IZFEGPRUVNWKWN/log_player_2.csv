"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500. This is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, or that Bob will end up paying more in the end. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
