"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 for it.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there. $16,000 is closer, but I'm only able to go up to $15,500. If you're open to that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",15500.0,Bob,4,
