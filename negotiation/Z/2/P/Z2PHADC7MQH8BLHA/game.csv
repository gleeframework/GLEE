"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still gives you a significant discount on what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
