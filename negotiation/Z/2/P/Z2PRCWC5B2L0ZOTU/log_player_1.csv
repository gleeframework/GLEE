"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* I want to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with just breaking even. 
* I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
* I'm confident I can get more than $1,000,000, as I have 9 more rounds to work with. 
* I'm also considering the option to sell to John, which gives me a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I'm hopeful I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, which is still a significant profit for me.
* This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable margin. 
* By lowering the price, I'm aiming to show Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal and encourage him to come closer to my desired price. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy further, potentially considering selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for me. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and offers a decent profit.
* Considering that I have only 6 rounds left, I'm not sure if I can secure a better offer from Bob.  There's a risk that he might continue to lower his offers, and I might end up accepting a lower price in the end.
* Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for the minimum price."
