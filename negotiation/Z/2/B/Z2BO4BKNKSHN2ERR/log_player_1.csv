Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $100.
* **Not Being Too Greedy:** While you could go higher, an excessively high price might discourage Bob completely, making him less likely to negotiate."
