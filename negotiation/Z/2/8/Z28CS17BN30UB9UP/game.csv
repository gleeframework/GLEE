"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you considering my product. While $10000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $12500. It's still a good price for you and allows me to get closer to my initial value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",10000.0,Bob,4,
