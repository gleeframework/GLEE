"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I can offer you the product for $115. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you. Let's close the deal!",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to go up to $112, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $113. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal now!",113.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $111, and that's my final offer. Can you accept that?",111.0,Bob,8,
