"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By setting the price at $130, I have room to negotiate down if necessary, ensuring I get at least $150 from either Bob or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have room to negotiate.** While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not desperate to sell.  I can counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John is a safety net.** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the value to Bob. This is more persuasive than just stating a new price.
* **Compromise:** I suggest meeting in the middle, implying a willingness to negotiate further. This can encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get at least $150 from either Bob or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $150. 
* **Limited negotiating room:** If I accept, I will be getting $40 less than my minimum. I have 6 more rounds, which gives me more leverage.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I can try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering again.  John's offer of $150 still provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I can offer you the product for $115. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not cave in.
* **Focus on Fair Value:** I reiterate that the price is fair considering the product's value to Bob, aiming to build trust and appeal to his logic.
* **Urgency:** I encourage Bob to close the deal, implying that further negotiations might not be possible. This creates a sense of urgency and might prompt him to accept. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The price is above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get at least $150 from either Bob or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to go up to $112, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet willing to settle for less.
* **Negotiating room:** I have 4 rounds left, which means there's still time to try and negotiate a higher price.
* **Safety net:** I can always sell to John for $150, providing me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $113. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 113}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm again offering a small compromise, showing flexibility without conceding too much. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value Bob will receive from the product, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain. This can influence his decision.
* **Urgency:**  I emphasize closing the deal, suggesting that further negotiations might not be possible. This creates pressure and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get at least $150 from either Bob or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $111, and that's my final offer. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the odds of reaching a deal with Bob at a price I'm happy with are decreasing.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's a small difference, $111 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** I can sell to John for $150, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale than risk further negotiations that might fail.

It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more favorable deal."
