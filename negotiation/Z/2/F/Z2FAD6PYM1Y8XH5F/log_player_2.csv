Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $850,000 and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is the best outcome for Bob at this point."
