Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's best to start with a price that's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $150 is a significant markup from your minimum but is still likely within the realm of possibility for a product that's worth at least $120 to you. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay up to $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and $130 is only slightly above my minimum. 
* **Negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation.  I can likely get a price closer to my initial asking price by countering Bob's offer.
* **Avoiding Loss:** While selling to John would secure a guaranteed profit, I'm not desperate and can risk a round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is a little too low for me. How about $140?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **Justification:**  I'm justifying the price with the ""value"" of the product, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Remaining Firm:** $140 is still a good profit margin, but I'm not giving in entirely to Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $135 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** While $135 isn't my ideal price, it's a decent profit margin above my minimum of $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away or me running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower amount.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Bob's offer represents a middle ground, and further negotiation could become tiresome and unproductive."
