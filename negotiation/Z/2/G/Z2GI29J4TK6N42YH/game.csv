"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, but I can't go any higher. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
