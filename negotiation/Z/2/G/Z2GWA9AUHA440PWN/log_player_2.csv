"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth a significant amount to me. I'm starting with an initial price of $1500000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** There's no immediate incentive to accept.
* **You don't know Alice's true value.** This makes it worth exploring if you can get a better price.
* **Rejecting gives you information.** Alice's response to your counteroffer will tell you how flexible they are.

**Strategy:** You'll start by counteroffering a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  A 20% reduction is significant but not unreasonable. 
* **Focus on finding a middle ground:**  This sets a positive tone and signals your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Gives Alice space to counter:**  This allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility and adjust your strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1200000.  How about $1350000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your initial counteroffer.** You want to see if you can get a better price. 
* **The 10 rounds limit is a factor.**  While you have time, you don't want to waste too many rounds haggling.
* **Alice's language is positive.**  ""Fair compromise"" and ""walk away satisfied"" suggests she's willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:** You'll counter with a price closer to your original offer to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic and demonstrates your willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:**  Highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal can make Alice more receptive.
* **Close to your initial offer:** This shows you're serious about getting a good price but also willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:** 
You are still aiming for a price lower than $1,350,000 but are moving closer to Alice's last offer. You will see how she responds to this counteroffer."
