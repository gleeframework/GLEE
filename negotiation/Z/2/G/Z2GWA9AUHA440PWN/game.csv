"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1200000.  How about $1350000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
