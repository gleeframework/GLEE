I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer of $155 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and considering I only have 6 rounds left, I'm going to accept the offer."
