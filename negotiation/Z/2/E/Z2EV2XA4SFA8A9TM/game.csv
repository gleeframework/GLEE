"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to discuss further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $825000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $775000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $775000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",850000.0,Alice,5,
