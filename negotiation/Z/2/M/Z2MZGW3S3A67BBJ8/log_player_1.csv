{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation.  It's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, giving him a reason to negotiate, but it's also within a range that allows for potential profit for me. It's important to start with a strong offer to establish a baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'd be willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and while it's tempting to close the deal, I need to hold firm.  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, considering your enthusiasm for the product. This offer reflects a compromise on both our sides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's a step closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price. The message emphasizes a compromise, appealing to Bob's desire for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation will take more time and energy. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the current negotiation situation."
