"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $12,500? This would give you a significant discount on its true worth while ensuring I get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
