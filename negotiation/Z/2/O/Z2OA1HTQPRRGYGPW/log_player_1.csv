Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
