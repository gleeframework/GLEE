"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Confident justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth"", I aim to steer Bob's focus towards the potential benefits rather than just the price tag. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The high starting price signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm aiming for a premium outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While I recognize its value, the asking price of $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he acknowledges the product's value, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000. I'll counter-offer in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value and engaging in this negotiation. While your offer is a good starting point,  I'm targeting a price closer to $1,900,000. This takes into account the unique benefits and potential return on investment for your specific needs.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** Showing respect for his initial offer helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm but flexible:**  I've significantly decreased my asking price from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, I'm holding firm above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique benefits and tailoring the pitch to ""your specific needs"" to justify the higher price. 
* **Call to action:** I'm encouraging further discussion and collaboration to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and desire for a higher price point. However, the current offer is still significantly above what I'm willing to spend.  Let's find a compromise - how about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John.  I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer further, so I will reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I've considered your perspective, and I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making another significant concession, dropping by $300,000, to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Firm (Above Reserve):** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm consistently highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business, justifying the higher price. 
* **Simplified Message:**  The message is kept concise and to the point, focusing on the key elements of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,450,000 is still below my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While we are getting closer, the difference is relatively small, and further negotiation might not bridge the gap to a satisfactory level.  

At this point, accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome without the risk of Bob potentially walking away in future rounds."
