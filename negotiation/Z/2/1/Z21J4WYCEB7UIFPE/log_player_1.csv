Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I know Bob is interested, but I'm also aware that he has a limit.  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm at a value that's more than what Bob offered. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I've reached a point where John's offer of $150 is more appealing. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
