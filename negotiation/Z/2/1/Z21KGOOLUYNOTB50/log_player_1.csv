Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to what John is offering, and I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial price.  At this point, I'd rather sell to John and avoid any further haggling."
