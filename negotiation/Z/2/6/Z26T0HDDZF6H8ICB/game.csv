"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think $10,000 is the minimum I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
