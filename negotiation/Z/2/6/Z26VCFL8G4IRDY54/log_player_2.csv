"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,500, which reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $14,500. This is a significant markup, and you have the option of buying from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've had other offers closer to $12,500.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

``` 

While $12,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price, and you have the option of buying from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
