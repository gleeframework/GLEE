"Alice,  $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while also allowing for some profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've had other offers closer to $12,500.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,
