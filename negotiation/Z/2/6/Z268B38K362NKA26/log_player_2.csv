"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is close to your limit, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit high for me. How about $135? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
