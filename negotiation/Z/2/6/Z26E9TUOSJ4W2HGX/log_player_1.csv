Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $800,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $825,000 is close to my minimum and ensures a sale.  There's a risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price, or needing to sell to John for $800,000.  This offer is the best compromise at this point."
