Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low.  There's room to negotiate.
* **Creating Urgency:** By offering a ""great deal"" and suggesting the product is ""perfect"" for Bob, we aim to pique his interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and for us to potentially still get a price higher than John's guaranteed offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much risk you're willing to take, you could start with a higher or lower price."
