"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd receive from another buyer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which is a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle on this. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
