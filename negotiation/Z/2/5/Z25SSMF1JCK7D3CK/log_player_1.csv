Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, allowing space for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel like I've given away too much.
* **Plan B:** I have a safety net with John's offer, ensuring I won't be left with nothing if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $1,350,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still close to my minimum.** I'm not desperate to sell, so rejecting his offer creates room for further negotiation. 
* **I can potentially get a higher price.**  By rejecting and counteroffering, I can try to get closer to my goal of $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always go with John's offer, which is my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $1,375,000?  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller adjustment:** I'm not going down too much, but I'm showing a willingness to negotiate. This keeps Bob engaged.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize ""fair deal"" and ""making this happen"" to keep the tone positive and encourage agreement.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the product's value to keep it top-of-mind. 
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum price of $1,500,000 to ensure I'm getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1,360,000? I think this would be a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is now only $40,000 below my desired price. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and increase the chance of Bob walking away completely.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If Bob rejects my offer again, I can still sell to John. This provides me with some security. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's only slightly below my target. This is a good outcome, considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
