"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
