Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. Considering Bob is only willing to pay $8,000, I'll offer him a price that's slightly higher than that.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $9,000. Since this is still below the value of the product to me ($15,000), I'll decide to reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price.
