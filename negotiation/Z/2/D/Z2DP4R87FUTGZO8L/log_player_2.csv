Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth and my own minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price and I risk losing the product. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at the maximum price I'm willing to pay."
