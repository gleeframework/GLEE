"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price today.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1500000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $1300000 is still outside of my comfortable range. I'm willing to pay $1100000, which is a fair price given the product's value and my budget limitations.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth and my own minimum requirements.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
