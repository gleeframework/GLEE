Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation."
