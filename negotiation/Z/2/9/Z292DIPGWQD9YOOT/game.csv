"I'm interested in the product, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $775,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",812500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $812,500. I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is the same offer I made earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800,000. Can you think about it and get back to me?",775000.0,Bob,4,
