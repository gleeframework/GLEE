"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your ideal range of $150. You have 10 rounds and can counteroffer. This gives you leverage to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** You provide a reason for your offer, mentioning your budget, which might make Alice more receptive. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This round is about gauging Alice's willingness to come down in price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $110 for the product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

* **Good Compromise:**  Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise, falling within your budget range of $150. 
* **Time is Money:** Accepting the offer saves you time and rounds of negotiation. 
* **Potential for Further Reductions:**  While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether."
