"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,250,000.  This reflects a significant discount and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to explore a mutually beneficial deal.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to at least receive $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,050,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value you place on the product while still allowing me to make a profit.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting very close to a deal!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,068,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1068750.0,Alice,7,
