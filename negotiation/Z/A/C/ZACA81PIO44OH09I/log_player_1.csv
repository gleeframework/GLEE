Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd ideally like to get, but it's still below what I'd accept from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. It also makes it less likely he'll walk away entirely.  I'm hoping to find a compromise price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,200,000, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by counter-offering.  I'm confident that John will be willing to wait for me to finish negotiating with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss in profit yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering the product at $1,500,000. This is my minimum price, and it's still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he'd be willing to pay. I'm confident that he'll accept this offer, as it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway. While I could continue to negotiate with him, I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  John is a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale that would cover my minimum price."
