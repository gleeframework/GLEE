Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,400, which would be $10,600. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is offering a price that's a good deal below your maximum budget and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a smaller difference might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
