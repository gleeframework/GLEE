"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $110 is more than Bob's value, it leaves room for negotiation and potentially finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Better Outcome Possible:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still lower than my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This would still allow me to make a profit while getting you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Reasoning Provided:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting that it's still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to continue the conversation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $70? That would be a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $70 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** Bob's offer shows he's still interested, and there's likely more room for negotiation.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  While I want to get the best price possible, I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, which is more than Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $70 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Urgency:**  I add a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I highlight the benefit for Bob, emphasizing it's a good price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to your price, but $85 is still a tad high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob's offer is still too low, he's showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's Offer Remains:** I still have the guaranteed $100 offer from John, which makes me less pressured to accept a lower price.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, while keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75. Let's split the difference and go with $80. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Close to Minimum:** $80 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still gives me some profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the fairness of the offer and the opportunity to close the deal.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to accept his next counteroffer, counter with a slightly lower price, or accept John's offer. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I don't want to lose a potential buyer."
