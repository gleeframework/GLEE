Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as 9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 11000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get the price lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as 10500. I'm willing to meet you at 10800, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's still worth negotiating further to see if we can reach an agreement. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as 10200.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While we're getting closer, I'm not sure if I can convince Alice to go lower, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to buy from John now to avoid potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product."
