"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's offer of $150, but you can still do better.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from another seller."
