 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, maybe around $60?"",

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a great price for a fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is meeting me in the middle, and $90 is a price I'm willing to pay. It's a good deal compared to John's $80, especially since Alice might be offering additional value or service."
