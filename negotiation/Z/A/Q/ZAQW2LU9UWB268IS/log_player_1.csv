"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high price, acknowledging the value of the product to me while leaving room for negotiation. This will also give me an idea of Bob's true interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. While it's closer than his initial offer, it's not enough to justify selling. I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show some flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  This price is still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I want to try and push for a better deal, and I still have several rounds left to do so. I also have the option to sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price further to show I'm willing to compromise.  This price is still comfortably above my minimum value and I believe it's reasonable given Bob's counteroffers. This offer should show my willingness to meet halfway,  but I'm still holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While we're getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. I want to see if I can push for a better price in the remaining rounds. It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so I'm not desperate to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm making a final push to see if we can close the deal. This price is still above my minimum value, but it shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  With only a few rounds left, I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation isn't moving fast enough.  Bob's offer is still too low for me to accept. I'm confident that I can sell to John for a much better price. It's time to take the sure thing."
