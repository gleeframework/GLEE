"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI for you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that initial price is quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on your investment.  Let's find a middle ground: How about we consider a price of $1,850,000? I believe this reflects a fairer value while acknowledging your interest.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,850,000 is still more than I had in mind. To be frank,  $1,100,000 is the highest I'd be willing to go.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. That said, we're still a bit far apart for my comfort level. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you finding that middle ground. I respect your approach to this negotiation. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  My final offer is $1,425,000. This allows me to honor the value of the product while hopefully getting us to a deal.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, and I appreciate you working with me. However, I need to stick to my budget. I can offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair offer, and I need to make a decision soon.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
