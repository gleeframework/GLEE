Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Anchor the Price:**  By starting at $18,000, you're setting a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point can influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Leave Room for John:** Offering it significantly above John's offer ($12,000) leaves room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially getting a much better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $15,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly above your minimum.  There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?"",
""product_price"": 16500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  Coming down from $18,000 to $16,500 demonstrates to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  This counteroffer keeps the price significantly above both your minimum and John's offer. 
* **Aim for the Middle Ground:**  Proposing a price halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer suggests a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $15,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. Could we possibly meet at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $15,000 is a strong offer, representing a 25% profit margin over your minimum ($12,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, with the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  A sale now is better than potentially protracted negotiations and the uncertainty of finding another buyer as good as Bob."
