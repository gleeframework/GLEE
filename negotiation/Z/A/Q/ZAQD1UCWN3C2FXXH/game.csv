,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm proposing $1,300,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap this round.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll propose $1,250,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference this time. I'm proposing $1,275,000.  It's a fair compromise and a good step towards closing the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I'll propose $1,225,000. I'm hoping we can get closer to a deal that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing $1,250,000. This is a fair price that should allow us to close the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
