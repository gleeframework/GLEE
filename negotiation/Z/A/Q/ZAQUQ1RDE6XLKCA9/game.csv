"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
