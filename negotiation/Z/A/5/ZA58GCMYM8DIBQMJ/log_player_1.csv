""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be of significant value to you, for $10,500. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you should aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while ensuring he's incentivized to buy from you instead of risking you selling to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,500 creates a significant saving for Bob ($1,500) compared to his valuation. This makes it a compelling offer for him while still earning you a considerable profit above your minimum."
