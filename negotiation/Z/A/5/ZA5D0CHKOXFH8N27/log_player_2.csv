"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  There are 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to get a better deal without immediately resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000.  Would you be open to that price?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but $1,300,000 is still above Alice's value of $1,200,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is direct and focuses on the price. This avoids unnecessary chatter and keeps the negotiation focused.
* **Sets the stage:** This counteroffer establishes Bob's initial negotiating position, setting the stage for further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Time is of the essence:**  With 10 rounds, accepting this offer saves time and potential further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John's price:**  While John offers the product for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $150,000. 

While further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal or having to accept John's price outweighs the potential for further savings."
