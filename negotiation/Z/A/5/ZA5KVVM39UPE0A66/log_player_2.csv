"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying from Alice at $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

While $130 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product from John for a lower price, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $120 since that's her minimum."
