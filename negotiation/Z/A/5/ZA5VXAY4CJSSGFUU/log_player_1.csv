Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving room for profit:** Offering the product for $120 gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a deal (saving $30 from your initial offer) while still ensuring you make a significant profit over his perceived value.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a reasonable offer."
