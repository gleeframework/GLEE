"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for $100 from John.
* Alice's offer of $85 is a good start, but you can likely do better. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming for a price closer to your $100 limit. 
* Offering $75 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. 
* It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, signaling your intention to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is very close to your limit of $100.
* Accepting this offer is a good compromise. You're getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of further negotiations.
* While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or the deal falling apart is not worth it at this point."
