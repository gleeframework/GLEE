Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great value at this price, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal.
* **Gauge Interest:** The high price is also a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he's immediately turned off, I know he might be a difficult negotiation. A counteroffer, even a low one, shows he's willing to engage.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $120 is higher than his perceived value of $80, showing he's willing to stretch. This is a positive sign.
* **Below My Minimum:** However, $120 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at that loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm open to negotiation but not at any price. This keeps the door open for him to potentially increase his offer closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm signaling flexibility by significantly lowering my initial price while still staying above my absolute minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not be completely undercut. 
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:**  The $170 price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for him to potentially counter again, ideally with an offer closer to my $150 minimum. 
* **John Option Remains:**  It's important to remember I have a guaranteed $150 sale with John. This prevents me from making desperate concessions and keeps the negotiation power somewhat balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. How about $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is now above my absolute minimum of $150. While not ideal, it's a profit I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing he's truly interested. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a potential extra $10 carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting the $140 secures a solid profit now."
