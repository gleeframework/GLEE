"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the [product name]. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's potential to get a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $175. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's try $160. It's a bit lower than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my desired price point, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John if this negotiation fails.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and minimizes risk."
