"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still too high. You'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product higher.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87.50 is still within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
