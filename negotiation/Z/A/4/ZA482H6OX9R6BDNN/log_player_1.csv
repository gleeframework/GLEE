Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($80), but still leaves room for negotiation. It's likely to be appealing to Bob, as he values the product at $100. This strategy balances earning a good price while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, it's still below my desired minimum. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $90 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product higher.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
