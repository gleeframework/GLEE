Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its features and market value, I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the features and value it provides. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value is considerably higher. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe it's worth less than what you're asking. I would like to propose $17,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $17,000 is the best move. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $17,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Better than John:** While John offers $15,000, Bob's offer is $2,000 higher.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $17,000, and further haggling might make him walk away. 

Accepting the $17,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers.
