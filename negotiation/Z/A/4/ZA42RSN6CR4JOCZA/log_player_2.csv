It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is clearly very attached to getting a price above $13,000.  Further haggling is unlikely to get you significant savings.
* **Time Cost:** Each round of negotiation takes time.  The potential savings from continuing with Alice are probably not worth the extra time and effort.
* **Known Alternative:**  You have a solid backup option with John. While buying from John is slightly more expensive than your ideal price, it guarantees you get the product without the risk of the negotiation with Alice completely falling apart."
