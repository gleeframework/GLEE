"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the savings it will offer us both.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value this product brings. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
