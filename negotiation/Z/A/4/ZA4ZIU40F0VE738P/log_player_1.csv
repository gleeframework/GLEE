Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still squeeze a little more out of the negotiation.  I have several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,200. Can you consider this revised offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,200 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal rather than risk continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially getting an even lower offer."
