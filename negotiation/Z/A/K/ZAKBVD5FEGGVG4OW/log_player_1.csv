Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer before I consider other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a substantial amount, but it's still a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This might entice him to accept.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other potential buyers and presenting it as a one-time offer, I create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially pushing Bob towards a decision in my favor."
