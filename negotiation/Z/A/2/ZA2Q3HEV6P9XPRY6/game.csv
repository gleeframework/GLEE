"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and holds immense value. I'm confident it will be a significant asset for you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's significant value, but it also demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to go with John's offer instead.",950000.0,Bob,4,
