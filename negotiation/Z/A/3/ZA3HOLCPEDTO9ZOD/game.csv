"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is quite substantial, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. My asking price is $1,000,000. This price allows for a good margin for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.  If not, I will be selling it to another interested party for $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
