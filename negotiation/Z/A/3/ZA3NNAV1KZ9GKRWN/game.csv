"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $10,500 is still a little high for my budget. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
