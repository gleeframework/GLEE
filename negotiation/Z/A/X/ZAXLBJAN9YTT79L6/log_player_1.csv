Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above that.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $100 offer.  At this point, it's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John."
