"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm very close to my limit here. To make this work, I'll need to stick to my previous offer of $1,175,000. I understand you're looking for a higher price, but this is the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
