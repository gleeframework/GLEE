Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored to $1,175,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  While we could continue negotiating, it's risky. Accepting his offer means a loss of $25,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer.  At this point, the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000 outweighs the potential, but uncertain, gain from a deal with Bob."
