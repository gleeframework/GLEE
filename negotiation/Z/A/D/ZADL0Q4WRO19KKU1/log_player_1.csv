Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,500. I believe this product will be very valuable to you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Aim for a price higher than your minimum ($12,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($10,000).
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above your minimum.
* **Highlight value:**  Subtly remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept even a slightly higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Gauging Bob's personality and negotiation style could influence a different approach."
