"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $18000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $18000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider reducing the price further to $15000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I still think $15000 is a bit below the product's value. How about we meet at $17000? This is a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a final concession to get the deal done.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am also considering purchasing the product from another seller if we cannot come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,6,
