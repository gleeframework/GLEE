"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit for you. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, it's still worth pursuing a better deal with Bob.  There are still more rounds left, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me. It's  more than Bob's offer, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. There are still many rounds left, and it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, but it still offers a good profit for me. It also signals my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still pushing for a price that is more in line with the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is a good deal for me.  It's just below my desired price but is still a significant profit. With only four rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal by pushing for a higher price."
