Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message focuses on the value proposition for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

By aiming high initially, you increase the chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation, while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
