Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Understanding the Goal:** My primary goal is to maximize profit. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Considerations:** By starting high, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understanding of the product's value. 
* **The ""John"" Option:**  The fact that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have an assured fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would mean a loss. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, providing a solid fallback option if the negotiation with Bob breaks down completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, But Not Too Much:** I'm reducing my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows willingness to compromise, but still keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:**  By seeing if Bob accepts this counteroffer, I can gauge how strongly he wants the product.
* **Maintaining a Profit:**  $1,200,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable value, so I'm still in a profitable position. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  This counteroffer balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential reward of getting a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he'll either keep offering low prices or walk away entirely. 
* **John's Guaranteed Value:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a safe and sure option compared to the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I'd prefer to sell for more, selling to John is a good compromise that avoids any potential losses."
