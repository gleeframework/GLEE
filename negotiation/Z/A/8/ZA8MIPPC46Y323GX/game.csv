"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to come down a little to $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  Let me know if that works for you.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. Let's split the difference, and I'm sure we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
