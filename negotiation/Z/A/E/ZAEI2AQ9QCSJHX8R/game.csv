"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a good compromise for both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another seller.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $12,800. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",12800.0,Alice,7,
