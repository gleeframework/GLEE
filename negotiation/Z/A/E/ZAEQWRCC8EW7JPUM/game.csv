"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a slight discount. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further to make this deal happen. How about $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in this product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget! $750,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
