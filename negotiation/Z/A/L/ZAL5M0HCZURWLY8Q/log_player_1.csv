Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you recognizing the inherent value of this product. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob. I believe he's genuinely interested and might be willing to go higher.  I'll use the next round to try and push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I need the price to come down a bit more to make this work for me. I can do $1,650,000.  That's a substantial investment on my end and shows how much I value acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a reasonable compromise at this stage. It's significantly above my minimum price and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
