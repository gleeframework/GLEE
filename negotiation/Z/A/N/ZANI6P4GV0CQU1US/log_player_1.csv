Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $100 is a reasonable markup from your minimum and still within a potentially acceptable range for Bob, given the product's value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price."
