"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer you $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This gives us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
