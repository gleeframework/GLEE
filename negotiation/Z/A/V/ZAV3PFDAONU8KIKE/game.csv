"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
