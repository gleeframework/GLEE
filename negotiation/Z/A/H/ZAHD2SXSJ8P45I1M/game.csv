"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
