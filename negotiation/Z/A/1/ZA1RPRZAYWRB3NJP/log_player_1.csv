Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $750,000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
