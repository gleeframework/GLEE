"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $750,000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
