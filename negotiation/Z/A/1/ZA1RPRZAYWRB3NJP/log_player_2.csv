"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially save a significant amount of money by making a counteroffer.  Buying from John immediately would be a waste of the opportunity to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $750,000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  Accepting her offer at $725,000 would save you $75,000 compared to buying from John.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will become less willing to compromise and you could end up paying more. It's a good deal at this point."
