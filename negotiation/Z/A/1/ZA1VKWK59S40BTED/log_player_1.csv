"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives Bob room to negotiate while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is far too low.  While it's tempting to take it, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,000. This is still a significant amount of money for Bob, but it's a bit closer to my desired range. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to come up a little higher in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still way too low. I'm not willing to go that low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $16,000. Bob is clearly trying to drive the price down, and I need to meet him halfway to keep the negotiation going. However, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable value.  I believe this is a fair price, and it's the best compromise I can make at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging, and his latest offer is well below my minimum acceptable value.  I've made several compromises, but it's clear that he's not willing to meet me in the middle. While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a safer option at this point."
