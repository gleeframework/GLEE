"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit much for me.  How about $7,500? That's a fair offer considering its true value.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
