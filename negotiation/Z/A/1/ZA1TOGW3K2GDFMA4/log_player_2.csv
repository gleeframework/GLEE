Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
