Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer doesn't sound like an ultimatum, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly high. 

**Important:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
