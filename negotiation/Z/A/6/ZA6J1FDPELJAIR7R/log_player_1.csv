Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet in the middle at $90?

I'm willing to take a slightly lower price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'll see if I can make a counter offer that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
