Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $10,250 is a good deal, and it's worth closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation."
