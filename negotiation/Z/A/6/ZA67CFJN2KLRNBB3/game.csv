"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for a very competitive price of $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer you $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me.  Let's try to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $9,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is my final concession for now. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
