Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but we have a comfortable buffer before hitting our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Approach:**  The language suggests the product's value and frames the offer as beneficial for Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
