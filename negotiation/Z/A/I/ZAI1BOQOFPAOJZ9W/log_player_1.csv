"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product.  I'm also emphasizing a collaborative approach to set a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the process.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows for a good return for me, while giving you a significant value proposition.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $775,000 is still too low. I believe I can get a better price, especially since we're still early in the negotiation process. I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Let's try $825,000. It's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $800,000. I think that's a very fair price and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached round 6. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will take too much time and may not yield a better outcome. John is offering the same price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
