"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. I'll do $14500, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final push, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll do $14000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're trying to make a final push, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $10000.",13500.0,Bob,10,
