Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential bargaining.  It also shows confidence in the product's value while not being overly aggressive.  I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a bit more. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still seeking a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge, and I've already made a compromise.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further risk of losing the deal altogether."
