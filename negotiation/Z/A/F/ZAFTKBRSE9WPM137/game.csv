"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1550000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the time it's taken to discuss this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
