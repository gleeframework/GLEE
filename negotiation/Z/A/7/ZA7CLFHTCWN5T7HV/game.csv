"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
