"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $102.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,4,
