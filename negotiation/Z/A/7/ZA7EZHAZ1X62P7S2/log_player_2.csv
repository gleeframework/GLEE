"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $170 when John is selling the same product for $150. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a good starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $155 is closer to my target price, it's still more expensive than buying from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $145. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product from Alice, but it's still a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is $152, which is only $2 less than buying from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially wasting more rounds. I'll buy from John for $150."
