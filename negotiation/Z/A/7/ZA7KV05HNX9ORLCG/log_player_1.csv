Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price from Bob.  It's a strong strategic move to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000. This avoids the risk of Bob potentially lowballing further or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
