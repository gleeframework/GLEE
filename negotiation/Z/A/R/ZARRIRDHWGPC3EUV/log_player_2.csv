It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $120 is still too high for your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
