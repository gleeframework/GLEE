"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, considering its potential and our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above my initial budget. To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This demonstrates my commitment to purchasing the product while staying within a reasonable price range.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
