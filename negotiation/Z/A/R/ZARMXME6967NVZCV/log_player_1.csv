Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business, potentially saving you significant costs and increasing efficiency. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000 before I open up the opportunity to other buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer, you want to get as much as possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below John's offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate up if he's highly interested, increasing your potential profit.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
