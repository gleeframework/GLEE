Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $11,500.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and finally agree to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a great deal. Considering the back and forth, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale and more than my absolute minimum.  I'm also concerned that continued negotiation with Bob might ultimately lead to a lower price."
