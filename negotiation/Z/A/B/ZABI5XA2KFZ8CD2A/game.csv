"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. I think this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach a minimum of $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,275,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
