It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $790,000, a saving of $410,000 from John's price and $10,000 from her previous offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is unlikely to drop the price significantly in the remaining rounds.  Continuing to negotiate risks her sticking to her price, leaving you with a less favorable outcome.
* **Time Value:**  A deal now is better than the uncertainty of further negotiation. 
 
While you could try for a slightly lower price, accepting now secures a very good deal."
