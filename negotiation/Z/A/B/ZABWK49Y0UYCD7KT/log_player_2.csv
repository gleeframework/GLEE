Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

Alice is negotiating, but we're still closer to her value than ours.  We'll reject and counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a price that's good for both of us."

Alice seems stuck around a price point that's not beneficial for us.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from her. Buying from John at $12,000 is a better option now, as we avoid further negotiation and potential price increases from Alice."
