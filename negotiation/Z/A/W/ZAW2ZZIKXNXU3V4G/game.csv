"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $8000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8200?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $8200 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $8500? ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $9000 to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8000 to $8500, which would be $8250. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $8400.  This price is fair for both of us. What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8100, which is the lowest I can go. Can you consider that price?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm trying to do the same.  $8100 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $8200?  I'm willing to accept that as my final offer.",8200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I've already offered $8100 and you rejected it. I'm willing to go up to $8150, which is the lowest I can go. Can you consider that price?",8150.0,Bob,8,
