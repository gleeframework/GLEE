"I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $107.50?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm happy to see you coming down in price,  $107.50 is still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now. How about $106?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
