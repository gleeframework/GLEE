"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $110 is better than John's $120, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating. I have 10 rounds, so I'm not under a huge time pressure to accept immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $107.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but $107.50 is still too high.  I'll try to push for a price closer to $105.  There are still several rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm happy to see you coming down in price,  $107.50 is still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now. How about $106?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and it's only round 5.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a good chance she won't budge further. Accepting $108 is still a good deal compared to John's $120, and I'm happy to avoid more back and forth."
