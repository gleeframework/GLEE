"Alice, thanks for your time.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is way outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial. I could consider $950,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end.",950000.0,Alice,5,
