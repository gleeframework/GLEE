"While I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
