The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $1,100,000. This means there is still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price. I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject her offer and try to get her closer to my desired price."

Alice has come down to $980,000, which is still a bit higher than my ideal price but is within my budget.  I'm willing to accept her offer and buy the product.  It's a good deal considering I could have bought it from John for $800,000 but I'm hoping the product will be worth more to me than Alice is valuing it at."
