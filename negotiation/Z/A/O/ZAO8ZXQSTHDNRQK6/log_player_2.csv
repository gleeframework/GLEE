"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. While he knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, he's offering a price slightly higher to account for potential negotiation. This counteroffer allows room for further discussion and hopefully secures a price closer to his desired target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $200 lower than the price Bob would pay from John. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to compromise. However, he's still trying to stay below his maximum price of $10,000. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $600 lower than what Bob would pay John.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the time and effort. Bob is better off buying the product from John and securing the purchase with a known price."
