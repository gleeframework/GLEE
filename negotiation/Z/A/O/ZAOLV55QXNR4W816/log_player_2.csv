"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product will deliver exceptional returns for your business.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Buying from Alice saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you're still getting a good deal.** You're paying less than what the product is worth to you."
