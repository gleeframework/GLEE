Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore a higher profit margin. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price but significantly above his valuation creates room for negotiation and a potentially higher sale price.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** By highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and  ""unique value"", I'm aiming to make the offer more enticing and encourage a quick decision."
