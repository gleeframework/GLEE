"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price, and it's a significant savings for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us,  and it's the maximum I'm able to pay right now.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant savings for you.  Let's close this deal, I think this is a good compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's wrap this up. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
