"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves some room for you to still make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit margin. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
