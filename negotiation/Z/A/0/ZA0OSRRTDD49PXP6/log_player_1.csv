{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is still higher than the $1,000,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your minimum price of $1,200,000, but leaves you room to negotiate higher if necessary.
* **It's a clear message:** It's direct and concise, making it clear what you're offering."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that we won't get much closer with further negotiation. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale and get a decent price for the product."
