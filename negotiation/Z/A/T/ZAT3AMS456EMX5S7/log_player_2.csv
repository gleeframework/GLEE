"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I'm extending this exclusive offer at a price of $95. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, taking into account its worth to you at $80. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay $95 to Alice."
