"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and I want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is well below what I'm willing to accept. How about $100? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, and we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a little higher than before, it's still well below my minimum. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $75 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $90 to meet halfway. It's a great deal for a high-quality product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  I think $90 is a fair compromise, given Bob's budget constraints and my own minimum."
