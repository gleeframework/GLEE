"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects the value it brings."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can offer you $1,050,000. This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell me a similar product for $1,200,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to use John's offer as leverage, but we know our product is worth more to Bob than John's ""similar"" product.  
* While $1,050,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to our minimum. 
* We are still in the early rounds, so we can afford to push back and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers, especially compared to other options in the market. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We made a substantial concession from $1,750,000 to $1,500,000. This signals to Bob that we're willing to negotiate but also holds firm to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're subtly countering Bob's attempt to use John's offer as leverage by reiterating that our product is superior and justifies the higher price. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This phrasing encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer, moving the negotiation towards a potential close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a strong offer considering my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, his pace is slow. We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and he's still significantly below our minimum.
* **Alternative Not a Threat:**  Bob keeps mentioning the alternative, but it's clear he values our product more.  We shouldn't be pressured by an implied threat that isn't really in his best interest. 
* **Calculated Risk:** By rejecting this offer, we are taking a calculated risk that Bob will come up further. We are still willing to negotiate but need to signal that we're prepared to walk away if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this deal.  However, to be frank, the offers are not moving at a pace that reflects this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000, but this is a firm offer.  I need to see a significant move on your side to justify continuing this negotiation."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Language:**  We're shifting from a collaborative to a more assertive tone. We're signaling that Bob needs to get serious or we'll walk away.
* **Final Concession:** The drop to $1,400,000 is a relatively small concession, indicating that this is our final offer unless Bob significantly increases his offer.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By mentioning that we need to see a ""significant move,"" we create a sense of urgency and put the ball firmly in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. However, this is my final offer. I need to know if we have a deal or if I should pursue my alternative option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product ($1,200,000). He has signaled this is his final offer and is prepared to walk away. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Even if we continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely Bob will go above his valuation.  We've already applied pressure, and further rounds would likely be fruitless.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees us our minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It's the most logical decision at this point to maximize our profit. 

**While we could potentially squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away and the time spent on further negotiation makes selling to John the safer and more profitable choice.**"
