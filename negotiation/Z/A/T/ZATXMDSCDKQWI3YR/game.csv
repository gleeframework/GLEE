"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects the value it brings.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can offer you $1,050,000. This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell me a similar product for $1,200,000",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers, especially compared to other options in the market. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a strong offer considering my alternative option.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this deal.  However, to be frank, the offers are not moving at a pace that reflects this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000, but this is a firm offer.  I need to see a significant move on your side to justify continuing this negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. However, this is my final offer. I need to know if we have a deal or if I should pursue my alternative option.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
