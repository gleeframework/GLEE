Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to stick to your original price, but I'm afraid $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Please let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

}

**Reasoning:**

While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob's offer of $975,000 is significantly above John's standing offer of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. Accepting the $975,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential for losing this sale."
