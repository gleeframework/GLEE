"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from Alice (it's worth $10,000 to her) and he has a backup option of John for $12,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm looking to spend a bit less though. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can potentially negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $11,000 is still within Bob's budget and a good deal considering he's looking to save money."
