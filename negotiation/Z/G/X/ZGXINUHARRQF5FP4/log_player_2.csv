"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way too high ($150). You should definitely counter-offer with a price much closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to feel like she's getting a better deal in the end.
* **Show Interest:**  While going low, it's important to express continued interest in the product. This signals to Alice that you're serious about purchasing and open to finding a compromise. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** By offering $80, we're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. It's unlikely Alice will accept this initial offer, but it opens the door for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $110 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to spend. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Continue Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so it makes sense to continue the conversation.
* **Target the Midpoint:**  $95 represents a compromise between your initial offer of $80 and her counter of $110. This shows a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Maintain Interest:** We still want to communicate that we're interested in the product, even while negotiating a lower price. 
* **Pressure Point:** Offering $95 puts a bit of pressure on Alice.  She knows you have the option to buy from John for $100.  This might encourage her to accept your offer or come down a bit further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is no longer budging in a meaningful way. Her offer of $102.50 is still above your $100 budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for a guaranteed $100."
