"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. That's the best I can do.",102.5,Alice,5,
