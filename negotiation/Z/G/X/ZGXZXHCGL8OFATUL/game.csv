"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $900000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'll meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
