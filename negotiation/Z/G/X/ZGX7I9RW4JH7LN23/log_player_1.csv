Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Could you meet me in the middle at $107.50? That would be a great compromise for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $107.50 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a higher price. There are more rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet halfway again. How about $109?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Could you consider $108? That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $108 is a good deal and only $2 away from my minimum. Since we're running out of rounds, it's a good strategy to accept Bob's offer."
