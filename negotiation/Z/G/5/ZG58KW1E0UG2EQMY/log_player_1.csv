Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to aim high. Starting at $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand about other buyers.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Your goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while keeping in mind your guaranteed $800,000 from John."
