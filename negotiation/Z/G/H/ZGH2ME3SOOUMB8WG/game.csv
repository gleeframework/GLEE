"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my valuation and the fact that I have another option for acquiring a similar product. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
