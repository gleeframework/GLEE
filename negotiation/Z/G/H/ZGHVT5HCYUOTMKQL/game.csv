"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",92.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it.",85.0,Bob,4,,
