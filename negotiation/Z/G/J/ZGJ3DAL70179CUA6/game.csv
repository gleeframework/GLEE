"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, this product offers unique advantages and I can't go as low as $850,000.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While $875,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $885,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",885000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $885,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $880,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product.",880000.0,Bob,6,
