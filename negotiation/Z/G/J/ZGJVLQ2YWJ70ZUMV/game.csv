"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $11,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",13250.0,Alice,5,
