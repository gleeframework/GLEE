"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to be within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,100,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,025,000 is simply not a feasible price for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,075,000. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000, which is my absolute maximum. Can we meet at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.  I believe this is a win-win for both of us.",1060000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, which is my final offer. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
