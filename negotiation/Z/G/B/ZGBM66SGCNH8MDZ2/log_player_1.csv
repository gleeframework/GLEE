Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount of money for Bob, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $800,000, and I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to reach a deal with Bob if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm getting closer to the negotiation limit. It's not the ideal price, but it's significantly better than John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
