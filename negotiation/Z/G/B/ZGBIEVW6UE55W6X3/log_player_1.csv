{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  I think it's a great deal for you, and it's definitely worth more than $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $135, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get by using positive language like ""great deal"" and ""worth more than $120.""
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob a reason to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $150. Bob's offer of $125 is significantly below that.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount, potentially enticing Bob to accept.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $130? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $135 to $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss to myself.
* **Re-emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition by calling it a ""great price for you.""
* **Staying firm:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

This approach aims to bridge the gap between our positions while keeping my goal of maximizing profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do $128. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. Bob's willingness to budge indicates that he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 allows me to take a calculated risk by continuing to negotiate.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $128. To make this work for me, I need to be closer to $130.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $129? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 129}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only asking for $1 more than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I frame the offer as ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially easing his resistance.
* **Finality:**  I'm adding ""we can finalize this deal"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap and hopefully secure a deal that's slightly above my minimum acceptable price, while also acknowledging Bob's efforts to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $128. That's my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob's final offer of $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and might not result in a better offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $150.

Given that Bob is firm on his offer and I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's best to avoid further negotiations and secure the sale to John for a better price."
