"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good starting point,  leaving room to negotiate if needed. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to lower my price if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$70 is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $100. I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $110. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product. However, if he rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $100, as I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging from his price, and I'm getting frustrated. I've already made significant concessions and I'm down to $110. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing any more time. I'm going to sell to John for $100, which is still a good deal for me."
