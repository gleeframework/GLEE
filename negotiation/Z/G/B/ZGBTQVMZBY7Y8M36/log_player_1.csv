Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to me and $100 to him. If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $120, but I'm hoping to make a quick sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $115, getting $110 is still a good deal, especially considering I can always sell to John for $120 if needed. This avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
