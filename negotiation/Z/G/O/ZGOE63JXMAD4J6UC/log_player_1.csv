"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Starting high ($2,000,000) creates room for negotiation and establishes a strong initial position. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""valuable asset to your business"") can incentivize him to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Even though my minimum is $1,500,000, starting at $2,000,000 allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately hitting my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, there are still 8 rounds remaining. This leaves room for further negotiation and potentially finding a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  However, I want to explore all options before resorting to this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the exceptional value of this product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still being above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the ""exceptional value"" reinforces the product's worth and justifies the price.
* **Creating a win-win scenario:**  Framing it as a ""benefit for both"" can make the offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable range, it's still $500,000 below my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **More room for negotiation:**  We've had only four rounds, and I have 6 more rounds to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I want to see if we can close a deal with Bob, I have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product, while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm slowly lowering my price, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reminding Bob of the ""unique benefits and potential"" helps justify the price.
* **Finding common ground:**  ""Reasonable range for both of us"" suggests a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's close this deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I may have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still $400,000 below my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time remaining:**  We're nearing the middle of the negotiations, with only 4 rounds left.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum price, making me less pressured to accept a lower price from Bob.
* **Potential for better offer:**  While Bob is making slight improvements, it's possible to push him further in the remaining rounds.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement.  However, $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  By dropping to $1,300,000, I'm showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Repeating the phrase ""true value"" reminds Bob of the product's worth and justifies my price.
* **Win-Win Scenario:**  Framing the offer as a ""benefit for both"" emphasizes mutual gains and encourages a positive response.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen"" adds a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
