Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,500 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He can either try to negotiate further or purchase from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is unwilling to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  Even though John's price is slightly higher than Bob's ideal, it's still lower than what Alice is willing to accept, and within Bob's budget.  It's better to secure the product now than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
