"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves you $3,000.
* **John's offer is less desirable:**  While you'll get the product, John's price is your maximum, so you won't save any money."
