"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't agree to a price that low.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value while being respectful of your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
