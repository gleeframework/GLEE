"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  A very high initial offer might discourage him completely.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what makes it so special.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is positive and suggests I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim to get closer to his perceived value of $10,000 while staying above my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $22,000 represents its full value, I understand you have a budget in mind. Would $19,000 be a possibility?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but not drastically. This signals some flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my target. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  By asking ""Would $19,000 be a possibility?"" instead of stating it definitively, I'm inviting Bob to engage further and potentially reveal more about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $16,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and provides a good profit margin.
* **Limited Time:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for a higher price might frustrate Bob and risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting this offer secures the sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, the $1,000 difference isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away."
