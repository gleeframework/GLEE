Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I can offer while still covering my costs and making it a worthwhile deal for me.

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still above my maximum. I'll reject and counteroffer again."

Alice is still above my maximum price. At this point, I've negotiated as much as I can, and I'm not comfortable going any higher. I'd rather get the product from John for $1,000,000."
