"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique features of the product, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.  This is the maximum I can afford to pay, given its potential value to me. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I have to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I can offer while still covering my costs and making it a worthwhile deal for me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident this product has value, but for me, $1100000 is the absolute maximum I can pay. If you're unable to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this product has a lot of value, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
