"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your concerns about the price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
