Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer than Bob's maximum allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's value and the return on investment Bob can expect, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, ensuring she doesn't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Alice aims to strike a balance between maximizing her profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
