"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me and the value it holds for you.",925000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, but that's as low as I can go.",900000.0,Alice,5,,
