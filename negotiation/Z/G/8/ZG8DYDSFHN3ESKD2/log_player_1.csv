"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm also hoping to get a sense of Bob's interest level and potential budget with this opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, while also demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this sale and potentially ending up with John's offer."
