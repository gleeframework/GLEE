"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable paying. To show my serious interest, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad to hear that you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating and would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This offer reflects a compromise on both sides and gives us a good chance to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1085000.0,Alice,5,
