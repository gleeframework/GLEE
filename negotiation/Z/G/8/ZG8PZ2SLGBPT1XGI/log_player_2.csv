"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000), so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable paying. To show my serious interest, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, but it's still below the product's worth to Alice, giving her room to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad to hear that you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to the product's worth to her, but Bob still has room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer, potentially securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating and would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This offer reflects a compromise on both sides and gives us a good chance to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. This demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while keeping the price lower than the product's worth to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is getting close to Bob's target price.  While there's still room for negotiation, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate in future rounds, or Bob running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at this point secures a good deal for Bob."
