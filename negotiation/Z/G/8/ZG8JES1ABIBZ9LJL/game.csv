"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we settle on $1,800,000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
