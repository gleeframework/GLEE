``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the benefit to Bob. It highlights the potential savings he can make by accepting the offer.
* **Strategy:** By starting with a high price, I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can either lower the price slightly or decide to sell to John instead."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me is $12,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your business, $13,000 isn't quite enough for me at this time.  Let's split the difference - I'd be willing to accept $13,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,250 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price with a counteroffer.  I'm also considering the risk of losing this deal and having to sell to John. It's a gamble, but I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 still isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and accept $13,375 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it!"", ""product_price"": 13375}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $13,375, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my target.
* **Message:** The message remains positive and focuses on the value the product offers to both parties. I emphasize the fairness of the price and try to encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Strategy:** This is a risky move because I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, it also shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him and willing to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely have to accept his last offer or sell to John."
