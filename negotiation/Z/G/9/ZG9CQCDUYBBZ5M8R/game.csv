"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe it's a good opportunity for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000, Alice. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand you're nearing your limit.  I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.  Let's wrap this up.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
