{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a significant amount. We're still well above John's offer, so it's worth negotiating further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can come down a bit further to $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and I hope you'll agree."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay $1,330,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is clearly committed to purchasing and the difference is getting smaller. Accepting at $1,330,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
