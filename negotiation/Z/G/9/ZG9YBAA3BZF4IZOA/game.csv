"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $92?  That's a pretty good compromise.",92.0,Bob,6,
