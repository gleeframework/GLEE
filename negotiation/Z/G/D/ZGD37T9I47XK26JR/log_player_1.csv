Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its unique value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the ""unique value"" of the product to potentially increase Bob's perceived worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that indicates I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially adjusting the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great!  I've secured a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing negotiations.
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll move on to John and sell the product for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a higher price. 
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my desired price (likely something slightly above $800,000), giving him a chance to come closer to my valuation. 
* I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If negotiations become unproductive, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $900,000? This is a fair price considering what John is willing to pay, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Referencing John:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about John's offer, emphasizing that $900,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Fair and Good Deal:**  I'm using positive language like ""fair"" and ""good deal"" to make the offer more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good price.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer with $850000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiations might stall:**  Further negotiation could risk pushing Bob away or prolonging the process. 
* **Time is money:** It's more beneficial to secure a sale at a price that's close to my minimum than to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
