"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than my minimum of $120.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's more attractive to Bob while still leaving me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm happy to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
