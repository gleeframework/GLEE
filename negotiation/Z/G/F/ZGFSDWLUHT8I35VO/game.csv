"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
