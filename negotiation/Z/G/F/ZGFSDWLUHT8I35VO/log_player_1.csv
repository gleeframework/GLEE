Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""steal"" aspect, hoping to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $1,200,000 offer gives me space to negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for me and potentially acceptable to Bob.
* **The John Factor:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a strong backup position if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I can still potentially negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can still get $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a ""great value"" for Bob, even though it's closer to my desired price point.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000 at this point, knowing John will pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Close Enough:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Going Lower:** Further negotiation with Bob might get me closer to my desired price, but there's a risk that the negotiations will drag on, or he might refuse to budge further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a $1,000,000 profit, which is my minimum requirement. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit with John rather than risking more negotiations with Bob."
