"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking of offering $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'm not desperate, so I can afford to be a little stubborn in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $82.50, which would be $78.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $78.50 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still only one round away from being able to sell to John for $80. I'm going to see if I can get Bob up to $80 in this next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  Let's try $80 then.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll save us from going back and forth any more."", ""product_price"": 80}
