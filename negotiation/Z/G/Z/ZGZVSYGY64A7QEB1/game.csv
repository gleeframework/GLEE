"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $19,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $17,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
