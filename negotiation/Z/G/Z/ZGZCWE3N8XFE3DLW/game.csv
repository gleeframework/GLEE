"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is far too low for me.  I understand it's a significant price difference, but  how about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a little low for me. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $115 is still a stretch for me. How about we settle on $105? That seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a good compromise, and it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,7,
