"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product has significant long-term potential that I'm confident justifies a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
