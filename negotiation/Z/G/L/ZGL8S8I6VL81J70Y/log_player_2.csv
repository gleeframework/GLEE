"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, you can likely negotiate a better price with Alice. You have a significant margin to work with and should aim to get the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. This counteroffer demonstrates my seriousness in buying the product while also pushing Alice to make concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a slight increase from her previous offer, which is not a good sign. While it's still better than buying from John, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will attempt another counteroffer to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $825,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired range. It's also important to note that $825,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuously raising her price. At this point, it's clear that she's not willing to budge significantly on her asking price.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer of $975,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget, and I can avoid further negotiations with Alice."
