"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering my maximum price point.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I've already discounted. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
