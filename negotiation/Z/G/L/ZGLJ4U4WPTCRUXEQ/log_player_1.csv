Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at the special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 tempts Bob with a perceived ""deal"" since it's significantly less than your asking price for John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this specific scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, though any offer below $100 would be accepted as John provides a guaranteed $100 sale."
