Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to Bob, aiming to maximize my profit. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate. However, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a good one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product.  I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'm happy to sell to John and get my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not going lower than this price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John to ensure I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go lower.  Rather than continue a potentially fruitless negotiation, I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself my minimum profit."
