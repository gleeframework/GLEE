Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creates room for negotiation.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Highlighting Bob's exclusive opportunity adds a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $1,100,000, exceeding John's offer.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to negotiate down towards $1,000,000 and still make a significant profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,200,000."
