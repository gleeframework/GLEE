"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,250,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
