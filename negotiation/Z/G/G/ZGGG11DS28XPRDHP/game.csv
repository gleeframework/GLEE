"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, reflecting the value I see in this product and recognizing the potential it holds.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're willing to pay, while also allowing me to cover my costs.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which reflects the value I see in this product while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find a price that satisfies both of our needs.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to make a profit. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
