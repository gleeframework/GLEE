Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're willing to pay, while also allowing me to cover my costs.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,175,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially considering I have the option to purchase from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which reflects the value I see in this product while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find a price that satisfies both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to make a profit. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still too high.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be moving very slowly and I'm worried that I'll run out of rounds.  I'm better off buying the product from John, even if it means paying the full price of $1,000,000."
