"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $800,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $800,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $825,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I respect that.  To be honest, $825,000 is a little too high for me. I'm willing to finalize the deal right now for $775,000.  This offer is firm, as I need to move forward soon.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're running on a tight deadline, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",795000.0,Alice,7,
