"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially closer to her $1,200,000 valuation."
