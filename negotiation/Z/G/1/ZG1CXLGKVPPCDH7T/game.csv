"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome. I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, and I'd like to see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.

"Alice, I understand your need for a good return, but $912,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $887,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm confident we can find common ground if we're both willing to compromise.",887500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $900,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. I'm willing to revisit this price, but I need to be confident that it's a fair deal for both of us.
