Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This is a good starting point as it's below what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is only $3 less than my initial counter-offer, and it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's more likely that Bob won't budge further.  To avoid the risk of him rejecting further offers or me having to sell to John at a lower price, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
