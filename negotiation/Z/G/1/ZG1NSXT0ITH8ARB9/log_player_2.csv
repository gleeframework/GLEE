Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I need to get for the product. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. That's the lowest I can go for now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

It's unlikely Alice will go below $900,000 and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price for my budget."
