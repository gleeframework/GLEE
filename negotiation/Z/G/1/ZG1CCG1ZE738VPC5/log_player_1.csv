{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum value, but still leaves room for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer. It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
