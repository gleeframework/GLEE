"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 10 rounds to secure a better deal, so rejecting Alice's initial offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob is aiming for a significant price drop, starting with a counteroffer that's $150,000 lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Fair Compromise:** While it's a significant drop, Bob frames it as a fair compromise, acknowledging the product's value but highlighting his own needs.
* **Focus on Agreement:** Bob emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement, signaling his intent to negotiate constructively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth to you and the initial offer I made. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:**  Alice's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000.
* **Closing in on Goal:** This price is closer to Bob's desired range, and further negotiation may not yield a much better outcome.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to reject offers risks a stalemate or a scenario where Alice walks away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing a good deal outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price. Accepting this offer secures a significant saving compared to John and allows Bob to move on."
