{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $8,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts at a slightly higher price than the product's value to Bob, allowing room for negotiation. This initial offer sets a strong baseline while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is a decent price, it's below my minimum value of $8,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 8000}
