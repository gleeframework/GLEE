"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1400000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1250000. This would be a fair price for both of us, given the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1250000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1400000. Let's try $1350000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1300000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1350000 and $1300000, which would be $1325000. I think this is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
