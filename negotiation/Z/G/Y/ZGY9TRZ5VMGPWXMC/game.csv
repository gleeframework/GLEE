"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8200. I'll offer you a compromise at $8600. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking that $8600 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $8000 is a fair price. Can we discuss this further?",8000.0,Bob,6,
