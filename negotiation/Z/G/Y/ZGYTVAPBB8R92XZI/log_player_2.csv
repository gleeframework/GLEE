"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering this product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's my absolute maximum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. How about we settle at $9,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $10,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my ideal price, it's still outside my budget. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John for $8,000.  This will save me money and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
