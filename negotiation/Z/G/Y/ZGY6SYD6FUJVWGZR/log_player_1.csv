Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,000,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's a round number:**  Round numbers can be easier for people to grasp and consider.

By starting with this offer, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest while also keeping the negotiation open to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000? This price still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $1,200,000 with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's split the difference and go with $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me. I'm concerned that further negotiation might drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower final price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing out on a better deal."
