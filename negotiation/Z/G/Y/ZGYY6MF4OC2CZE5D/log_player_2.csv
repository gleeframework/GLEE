It's always good to try and negotiate a better price. $850,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement. Let's see what Alice will counter with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  A price of $700,000 is still a good deal for me, but it leaves room for negotiation."

Alice is coming down, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $750,000.  This is still a good deal for me, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer."

Alice has come down to $765,000. That's within my budget, and it seems like we're close to a deal. I'll accept her offer and move on."
