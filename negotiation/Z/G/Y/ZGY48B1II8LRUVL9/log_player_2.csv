Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $13,000, he's getting the product for less than John's price, and it's a good compromise considering Alice's previous rejection."
