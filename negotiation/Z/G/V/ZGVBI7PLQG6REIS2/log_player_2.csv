"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I'll receive, and I'm confident it's a profitable deal for you as well. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
