"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,500, and that's as low as I can go. I think this is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11,200, and that's as low as I can go. I think this is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",11200.0,Alice,5,
