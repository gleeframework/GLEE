"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By mentioning ""finding a mutually beneficial agreement,"" we signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

This initial offer aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging the negotiation process ahead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. My counteroffer for the product is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is substantial, we are still in the early stages of negotiation. It's likely that we can negotiate a higher price, especially since we have eight rounds remaining. Accepting $800,000 from John is our safety net but we're aiming higher for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and recognize his desire for a fair deal. This helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Justify Position:** By stating the price is below its ""true value"" we subtly reassert our product's worth.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** We signal willingness to negotiate by coming down from our initial price, but our counter-offer remains significantly above both Bob's offer and our guaranteed price from John.  
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This phrasing, while not a literal midpoint, suggests fairness and can encourage Bob to move closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our desired range, but $950,000 is still below our aspirational target. We are willing to negotiate further, but we'll hold firm for now to see if we can push the price higher. We still have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is cutting it too close. Would you consider $965,000? I think that's a fair and reasonable price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 965000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Appreciation:** Acknowledging Bob's efforts to find a compromise can foster goodwill.
* **Slight Concession:** We're reducing our asking price, but in smaller increments to signal we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Frame as Win-Win:**  By stating this price is ""fair and reasonable for both of us,"" we aim to make Bob feel good about the potential deal. 
* **No Ultimatums:**  We want to keep the negotiation open and avoid language that might make Bob defensive.

We're getting closer to a potential deal, but we're still aiming for the best possible price above our guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $955,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $955,000 is a strong price and shows movement from his previous position. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher amount, the difference is likely to be small. 

Here's why accepting is a good strategy:

* **Significant Profit:**  $955,000 is a $155,000 profit margin, well above our guaranteed $800,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays or the risk of Bob decreasing his offer later.  
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a reasonable offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and builds goodwill for potential future interactions.

While there's a slight chance of getting a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer outweighs the potential for a marginally better outcome."
