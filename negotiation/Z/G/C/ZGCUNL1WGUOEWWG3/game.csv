"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $157.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle for $152.50? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",152.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,7,
