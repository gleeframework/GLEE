"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $820,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $800,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your hard limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I think I can meet you closer to the middle and offer $850,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",850000.0,Alice,5,
