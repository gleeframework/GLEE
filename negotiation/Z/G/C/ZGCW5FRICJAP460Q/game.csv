"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer, but $1200000 isn't quite enough for me.  Considering the potential value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1350000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm eager to see this product in your hands, $1250000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
