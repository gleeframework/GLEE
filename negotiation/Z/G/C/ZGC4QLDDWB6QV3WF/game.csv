"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to try to make this work.  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure that we both feel good about the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to make one last adjustment.  Let's meet at $975,000.  This would allow us both to close this deal without compromising too much on our individual goals.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $925,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's the final offer I'm willing to make.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go below $950,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I want to be upfront with you - I'm also considering buying this product from another seller for $1,500,000. If we can meet at $925,000, I'd be willing to move forward with the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,8,
