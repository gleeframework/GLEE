Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the value the product holds for Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing interest:** I'm framing the message as if the product would be a good fit for Bob, which can make him more likely to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The question at the end invites Bob to engage in further discussion.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Bob's offer is still above my minimum value of $80, but it's significantly lower than my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, and hopefully reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate you're interested.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'd be willing to meet in the middle at $110.  Does that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Remaining firm:**  I'm not going below $110 because I still want to maximize my profit.  
* **Positive language:**  The message is polite and encourages further discussion.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my initial desired price of $110.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially try to get another $5 from Bob, there's a chance he might walk away entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and I can secure a good price with this offer. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit while minimizing risk."
