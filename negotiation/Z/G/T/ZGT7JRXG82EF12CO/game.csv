"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $1,125,000. This price respects your valuation while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a final offer of $1,137,500.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
