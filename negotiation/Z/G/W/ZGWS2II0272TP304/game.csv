"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $900,000. This is a great product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $825,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
