Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?
