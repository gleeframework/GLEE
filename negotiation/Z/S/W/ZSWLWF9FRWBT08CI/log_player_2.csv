"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal.  You're willing to buy from John for $15,000, so you have some room to bargain."
