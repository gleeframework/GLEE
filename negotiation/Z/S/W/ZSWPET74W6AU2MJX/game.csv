"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for a price of $2000000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is simply not a realistic price for this product, considering its value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value I'm confident you'll gain from this product. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1750000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still significantly lower than what I believe this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $1600000.  This price reflects the value I'm confident you'll gain from this product. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1500000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
