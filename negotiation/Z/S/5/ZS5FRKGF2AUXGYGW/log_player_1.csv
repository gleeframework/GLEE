Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly above Bob's value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I don't undervalue the product too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for $105 just yet. There's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a higher price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to keep negotiating with him and risk getting a lower price. Selling to John for $120 is the best option at this point."
