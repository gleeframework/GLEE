"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so accepting this offer still yields a significant profit.  There is some risk in rejecting the offer and making a new counteroffer, as Alice may not be willing to negotiate further.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 would completely eliminate any potential profit, so it's not the best option in this situation."
