Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe its fair market value is around $20,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $17,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $17,000 positions it as a potential deal for Bob. He gets it for $5,000 less than what he perceives as its market value, and you earn a profit above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies some flexibility in the price. If Bob counters, you can potentially still negotiate a price higher than $15,000."
