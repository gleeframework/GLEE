"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $10000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value it brings to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $12000. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
