"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $10,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John at $10,000, ensuring I stay within my budget.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and I'm already risking exceeding my budget."
