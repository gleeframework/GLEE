"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This product truly is a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I still feel that $1,350,000 is out of my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer, and conceding now would leave money on the table. It's important to show Bob we're willing to negotiate but also that we have a firm bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down slightly further. Would you consider $1,300,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation and Bob is slowly increasing his offers. A small concession on our part might encourage him to move closer to our desired price.  We are still aiming for a price above John's offer to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $1,275,000 is a profitable outcome, exceeding John's offer by a significant margin.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
