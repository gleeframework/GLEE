"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $145 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $125 is closer but still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  How about $115? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's just a small step up from your last offer. Let's try to reach an agreement.",115.0,Alice,5,
