"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go down to $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle at $8,500? This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs.",8500.0,Alice,5,
