{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down to $10,875, which is a significant saving compared to his initial budget of $12,000.  While he could continue to negotiate, the potential gains are smaller, and the risk of losing the deal increases.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
