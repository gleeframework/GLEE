"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at this point.  Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000 shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating. This initial offer is far enough away from Alice's starting point to potentially create room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a step closer to your desired price, but it's still above your target.  You have room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my target.  It's likely that Alice will either accept this offer or counter with something closer to my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $200 above my target price.  At this point, further negotiation may not be worth the risk.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a decent price, and it's still lower than what I'd pay John."
