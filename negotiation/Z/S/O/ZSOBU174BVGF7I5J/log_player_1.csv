Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  bringing the price closer to his $120 limit. 
* **Secure a Sale:** While John guarantees $150, selling to Bob quickly at $140 is still more profitable than potentially waiting or dealing with further negotiation with John. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest price from Bob and ensuring a successful sale."
