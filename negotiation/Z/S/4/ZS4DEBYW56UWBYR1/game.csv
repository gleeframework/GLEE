"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
