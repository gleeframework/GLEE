"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. Is this something you'd be interested in?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $150. Would you be willing to go down to $175? ",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit more than your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise - I'll meet you in the middle at $212.50. Would you be interested in that price?",212.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $212.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $193.75?  Let's get this deal done.",193.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $193.75. I can offer you $225, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but still a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",225.0,Alice,5,
