"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise.  I'm confident this will be a profitable deal for both of us. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
