"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  Considering our respective values, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
