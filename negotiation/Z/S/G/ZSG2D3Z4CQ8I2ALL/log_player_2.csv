"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to you. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's good to keep in mind, but it's not the best choice at this stage."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
