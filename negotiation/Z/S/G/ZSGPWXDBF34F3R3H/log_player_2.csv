"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and worth every penny. Given its value, I propose a price of $9500 for it. This is a great opportunity to own something truly special. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You have a budget of $10,000, so there's room to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $8,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $8500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while being mindful of your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still $500 above your target price of $8,000, so it's worth seeing if you can squeeze a bit more out of Alice. You've already shown that you're willing to negotiate, so there's a good chance she'll come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a little tight. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This allows us both to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you've made a genuine effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. Thank you for considering my perspective as well. To further accommodate your budget, I propose a price of $8400 for the product. This still offers a good return while keeping the transaction within your financial limits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $8,400, which is only $400 above your target price of $8,000.  Considering you have limited rounds left, it's likely you won't get a much better offer from Alice.  Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
