Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll reap from it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message hints at the product's value and positions the offer as exclusive to Bob, potentially influencing him to accept before exploring other options. 

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of:

* **Bob Accepting:** He might find the deal attractive enough, especially if he highly values the product's unique benefits.
* **Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, Alice has room to negotiate down to a price still higher than John's offer.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while keeping the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
