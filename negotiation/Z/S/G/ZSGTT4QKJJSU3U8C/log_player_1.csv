"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and am open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique potential"" and ""true value,"" you create a basis for the high initial price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:** You signal a willingness to negotiate, which keeps Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above your absolute minimum ($1,200,000), but there's still potential to secure a better deal. 
* **Early Stages:** It's only Round 2, so rejecting this offer doesn't significantly increase the risk of losing the deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting and countering, you demonstrate your own value perception for the product and maintain a stronger negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,375,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic signals a compromise and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired price.
* **High Anchor:** By maintaining a price significantly above Bob's offer, you keep a strong anchor point for future negotiation rounds. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the ""true worth"" reminds Bob of the product's value and justifies the higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed it carefully and would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this is closer to what we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there might be a slight chance of getting a higher offer, continuing the negotiation increases the risk of Bob walking away or stalling. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows you to reinvest the earnings or utilize the capital for other opportunities."
