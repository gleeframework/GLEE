Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $10,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. "", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob seems adamant about $8,000. I've already gone through several rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm not comfortable going lower than my floor price of $8,000, so I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
