"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement on this amount.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is still a good price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this amount. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",815000.0,Alice,5,
