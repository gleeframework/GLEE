"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to move closer to your figure. How about we settle at $910,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings to both of us.",910000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $910,000, which would be $880,000. Would you be open to discussing this price?",880000.0,Bob,4,
