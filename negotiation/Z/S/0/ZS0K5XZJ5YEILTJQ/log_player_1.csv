Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value gives him a good deal while still earning you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's concise, positive, and hints at the product's value to Bob without explicitly revealing your knowledge of his valuation.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his perceived value, making it a tempting offer.  You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
