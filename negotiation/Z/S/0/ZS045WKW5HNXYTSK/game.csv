"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,750 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
