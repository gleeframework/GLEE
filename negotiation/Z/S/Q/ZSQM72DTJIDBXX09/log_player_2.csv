"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Given its unique benefits, I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  I'm not in a rush, so I can risk rejecting this offer and see what counteroffer Alice makes."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting the value of the product and a fair compromise. This would still allow you to realize significant gains from this investment.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe I can get the price down further, especially since Alice has already dropped her offer from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000.  I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
