"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $9,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This gives us both a good value and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,750 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Let's try $8,600. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
