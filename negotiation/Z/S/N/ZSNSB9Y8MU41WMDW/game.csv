"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,800,000 is a significant departure from my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
