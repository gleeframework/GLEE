Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a good start, it's significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $780,000 is a tempting offer, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we compromise at $880,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}
