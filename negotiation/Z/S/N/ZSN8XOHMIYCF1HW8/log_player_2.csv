"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a good start, it's significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $780,000 is a tempting offer, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we compromise at $880,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: While Alice is coming down in price, she seems pretty firm on staying above $850,000.  It's unlikely she'll go below John's $800,000 offer at this point.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
