"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a good start, it's significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $700,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I could do $780,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $780,000 is a tempting offer, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we compromise at $880,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's make this happen.",880000.0,Alice,7,
