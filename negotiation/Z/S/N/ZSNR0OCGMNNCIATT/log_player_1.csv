Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
