Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but not so high that it's immediately rejected. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  $12,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell at this point.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to drop my price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come back to $12,000, which is a reasonable offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose Bob as a buyer altogether. It's better to secure a sale at a price that is still above my minimum."
