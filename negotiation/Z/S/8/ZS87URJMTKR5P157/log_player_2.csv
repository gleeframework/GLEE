You should buy from John. You've negotiated with Alice as much as you can, and the price is now only $100 less than what you can get from John.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as it's unlikely she will go lower than $8,900.  You're better off securing the product from John at a guaranteed price."
