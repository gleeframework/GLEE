"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  Let's talk - I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better.  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially get a price closer to your target of $800,000."
