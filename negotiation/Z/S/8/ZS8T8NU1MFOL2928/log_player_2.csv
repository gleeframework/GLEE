"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is way above your budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and it's what I'd be willing to pay to acquire it from another source. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, the value this product offers is truly significant. Let's meet halfway - how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can get closer to my target price.  I'm confident I can secure the product for less than $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
