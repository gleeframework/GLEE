Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than what he'd be willing to pay.
* **It's lower than your fallback price:** This ensures you'll still make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer. 

By offering a price slightly lower than your fallback price, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, while still securing a decent profit."
