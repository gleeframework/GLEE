Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is aggressive, but leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and we can then assess whether to accept or continue negotiating. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **High starting point:**  $1,400,000 is close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves him with a significant profit margin.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept this price, but it establishes a clear expectation that the price will be closer to $1,400,000 than $1,000,000.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we have the option of accepting John's offer of $1,000,000, which ensures we don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still a significant profit for us, but there's room for us to push for a higher price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that we're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Leverage John's offer:** Knowing John's offer of $1,000,000 gives us a safety net. We can confidently negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept his counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

We'll make a counteroffer to Bob that is slightly lower than our initial offer but still higher than his offer. This will demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to our desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that we are willing to move closer to Bob's price point while still pushing for a higher value for the product. 
* **Strategic midpoint:**  $1,350,000 is a midpoint between our previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,300,000). This suggests a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a position of strength.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  We are still above John's offer of $1,000,000, giving us the flexibility to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet us halfway.

By offering $1,350,000, we demonstrate flexibility while also making it clear that we are not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small gap:** The difference between Bob's offer ($1,325,000) and our previous offer ($1,350,000) is only $25,000.  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a small gain, potentially at the risk of losing Bob altogether.
* **Reasonable profit:**  $1,325,000 is still a substantial profit for us and is significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit.  There's always the risk that Bob could change his mind or that further negotiations might lead to a stalemate.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and risk-averse choice. It secures a good price for the product while minimizing the possibility of losing the sale altogether."
