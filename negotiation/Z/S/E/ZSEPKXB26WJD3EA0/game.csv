"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me, but I'm not able to go that high right now.  I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $8250 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you at $8300, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8300.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  Let's try to finalize this. I'm willing to meet you at $8200. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiation.",8200.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8200. I'm willing to meet you at $8300, but I'm not going any lower. This is the final offer I can make.",8300.0,Alice,7,
