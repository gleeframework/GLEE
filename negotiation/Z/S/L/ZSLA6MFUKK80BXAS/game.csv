"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $1400000 for the product?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1200000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
