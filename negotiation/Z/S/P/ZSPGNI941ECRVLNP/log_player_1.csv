{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's of great value and would be very beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to earn at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy ($10 profit for him).
* **Backup Option:** While you have John as a backup buyer at $100, it's always better to secure the highest possible price first."
