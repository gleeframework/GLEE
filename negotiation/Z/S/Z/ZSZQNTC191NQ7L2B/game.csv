"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $105. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? I think that's a reasonable price for the product, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
