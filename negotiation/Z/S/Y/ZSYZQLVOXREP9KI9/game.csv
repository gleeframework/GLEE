"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm serious about buying this, but I can't go any higher.",125.0,Bob,4,
