"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is still a bit high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the price closer to my target. It's a significant jump down, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met you halfway between your last offer and her original price. This is a reasonable deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the opportunity to buy for less than John's offer."
