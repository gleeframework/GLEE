"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate reason to accept.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. If you can't get a lower price, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at this moment. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significant discount, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still reflects the value of this product. This is my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000.  This is still within my budget and is a good deal considering I could purchase from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves me $100,000."
