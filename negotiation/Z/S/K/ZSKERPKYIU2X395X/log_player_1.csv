Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the message positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 
* **Strategic pricing:**  The price is high enough to potentially maximize profits, but also leaves room for a counteroffer without losing too much. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120.  It's not worth selling the product for that price, as I can easily get $120 from John.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  This will allow me to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but remaining open to negotiation.  
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, offering a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $100 is a fair price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while staying within my acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still only able to pay $85.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm ready to buy the product right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $85, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm not willing to compromise further, and selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit.  

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John and end the negotiation with Bob."
