# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but my max is $12,000. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum. There's room for further negotiation. It's important to stay firm on the budget and try to reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm still stuck at $12,000 though. That's my absolute max. Is there any way we can make this work?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I also need to be fair to myself. How about $15,500?  This feels like a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you see the value in closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down in price, $15,500 is still higher than his maximum budget of $12,000.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his desired price, saving him $3,500 compared to Alice's latest offer."
