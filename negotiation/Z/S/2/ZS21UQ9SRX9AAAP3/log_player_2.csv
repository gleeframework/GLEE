"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $95 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to Alice's valuation. This shows good faith and indicates Bob is serious about negotiating.  The offer is still within Bob's budget, allowing for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $90 is closer to his desired price, it's still above Alice's valuation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving, allowing for potential for a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $87.50?  That's halfway between our last offers, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by proposing a compromise.  $87.50 is still within Bob's budget and is closer to Alice's valuation. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."
