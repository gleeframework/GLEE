"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal! ",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
