"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, but still within what I think Bob would be willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate if needed, while also demonstrating that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $90 is still a decent profit for me, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  It's better to secure a sale than risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's offer."
