I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a profit for myself. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and agree to this price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time.  It's not worth risking further negotiation for a lower price. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, so I'll take it."
