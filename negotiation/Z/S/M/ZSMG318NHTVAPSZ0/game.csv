"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product can truly benefit you.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers.",11000.0,Alice,5,
