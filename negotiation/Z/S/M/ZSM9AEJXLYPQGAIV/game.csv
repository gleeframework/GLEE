"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion will help us reach an agreement that suits both of our needs.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,450,000. This allows us both to achieve our goals and move forward with this transaction. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
