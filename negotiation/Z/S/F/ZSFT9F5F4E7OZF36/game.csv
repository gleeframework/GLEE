"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $950,000? This offer reflects the serious interest I have in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your persistence demonstrates your understanding of this product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This offer reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring a fair price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest,  $1,125,000 is a bit too close to my limit for me to be comfortable. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer.  It reflects the absolute maximum I can afford for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
