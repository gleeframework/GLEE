"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the product's significant value while still offering you a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
