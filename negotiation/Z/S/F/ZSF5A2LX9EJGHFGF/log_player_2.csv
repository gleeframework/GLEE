"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for even less.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still within Bob's budget and a decent deal.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's not worth risking losing the product to John for $150."
