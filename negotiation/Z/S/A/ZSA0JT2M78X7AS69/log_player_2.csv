"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's true value, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating further.  There's no guarantee he'll get a better offer, but the potential savings outweigh the risk of losing the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,175,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations, Bob has the chance to get a lower price closer to his ideal. There's always a risk of failing to reach a deal, but the potential savings outweigh the risk at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,125,000 is still significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **The risk of continuing is too high:** There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and Bob has already rejected several offers. With only 5 rounds left, the potential for a successful deal with Alice is shrinking.
* **A guaranteed deal:** John offers a guaranteed deal at Bob's target price. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget.

At this point, the potential savings from continued negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of failing to reach a deal and the guarantee of a successful purchase from John."
