Alice's offer:

This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.

It's time to switch tactics.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and even if she did it would be a marginal saving at this point. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
