Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that is:

* **Attractive enough to accept:** It needs to be below his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Maximizes your profit:**  The closer to $800,000, the better for you.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $780,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency.  
* **Price:** Offering it at $780,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still earning you a substantial profit above your guaranteed sale price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to allow room for bargaining. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly less aggressive price."
