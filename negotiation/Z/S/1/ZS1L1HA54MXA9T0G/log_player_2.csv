"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $120.  This offer is still within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is a reasonable compromise, considering my initial counteroffer of $100 and her previous offer of $120. It's still within my budget of $150, and accepting this offer saves me $35 compared to buying from John."
