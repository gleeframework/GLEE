Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This allows for significant negotiation room.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer ($1,800,000), you set a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than $1,000,000.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** This strategy is aggressive and carries a risk that Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
