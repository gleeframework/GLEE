"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and while I'm not willing to part with it for less than $1,000,000, I'm open to a fair negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a substantial opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential worth. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
