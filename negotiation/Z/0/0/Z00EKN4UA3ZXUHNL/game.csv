"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $13000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
