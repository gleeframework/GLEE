Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
