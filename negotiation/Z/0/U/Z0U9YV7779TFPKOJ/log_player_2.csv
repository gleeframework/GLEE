"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and John's offer ($100). 
* There's ample room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you can try to bring the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($80), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a negotiation range. 
* **Anchoring:**  This opening counteroffer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Alice to make concessions more readily.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer, there's room to gradually increase the bid while staying well below our $100 limit and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand it's a bit more than you were hoping to spend, how about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $140 remains above both your $100 budget and John's $100 offer.
* **Negotiating Position:**  You've successfully moved Alice down from $200. This indicates there's likely room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** The presence of John's offer at $100 provides you with leverage. You can afford to be firmer in your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We're increasing our offer from $80 to $90, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also staying firm. 
* **Below Budget, Above John:**  This counteroffer remains below your $100 budget while being closer to Alice's value of the product. It also maintains a price advantage over John's $100 offer.
* **Pressure Point:** By staying under $100, you're subtly reminding Alice that you have a viable alternative if a compromise can't be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me here.  How about we split the difference again and call it $115? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's ""final offer"" of $115 is still above your $100 budget.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, saving you $15 compared to Alice's final offer. 
* **Finality:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, signaling that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price within your budget.

While you could attempt one more counteroffer, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice refusing and sticking to her $115 price.  At this point, it's strategically advantageous to secure the product from John at your target price."
