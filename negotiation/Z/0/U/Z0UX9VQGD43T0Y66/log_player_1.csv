Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, close to the middle ground between our valuations. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** I highlight the product's value to him, making the offer more tempting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting a response from Bob, making it clear I'm open to discussion.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a balanced negotiation. It positions me strongly while allowing for flexibility and potential concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000, my initial offer. $9,000 is too low.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Bob's counteroffer shows his interest in the product. This gives me the opportunity to push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed option, but I believe I can get more by continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore a more favorable price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price still reflects a significant value for you, and it's closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This can make Bob more receptive to finding common ground.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for him, reminding him of the benefit of this deal.
* **Urgency:** ""Let's find a way to make this work!"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages a response.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility and positions me to potentially close the deal in the next round.  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still retain a decent margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limits. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, let alone my desired profit.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob and explore a more favorable price. 
* **Potential for a Deal:** Bob's continued interest suggests a deal is possible at a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. I can continue to push for a higher price, aiming for closer to my initial offer of $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product will be worth much more to you than that. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a significant concession from my previous offer, showing my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefit of a deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Let's make this happen!"" conveys a sense of optimism and encourages Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a final attempt to close the deal with Bob before considering other options. It offers a price that's fair to both parties and positions me to potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $9750? It's the highest price I'm willing to pay, but I really want to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While Bob's offer is still below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $8,000 is high.
* **Positive Negotiation:** Bob's message shows his sincere desire to close the deal, making it likely he won't budge further.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale, minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the time constraint and the possibility of a lower sale to John."
