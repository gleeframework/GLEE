"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This price still reflects a significant value for you, and it's closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a way to make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limits. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product will be worth much more to you than that. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $9750? It's the highest price I'm willing to pay, but I really want to make this deal work.",9750.0,Bob,6,
