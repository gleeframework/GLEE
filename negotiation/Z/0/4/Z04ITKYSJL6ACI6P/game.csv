"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product though, and I'd be willing to pay $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. Considering your offer of $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14000, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm not sure I can go higher than $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can sell it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
