"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,200. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Bob,4,
