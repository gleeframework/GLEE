"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product for $85? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $78? That's a reasonable compromise between our positions.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $80.  This product is worth more to me than that, and I believe it's worth more to you too.  Let's meet halfway, and I'll offer it to you for $82.  This is a good deal for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,
