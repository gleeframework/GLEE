"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than your maximum, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal. It's still above Alice's value for the product, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down from $130 to $115, which shows she's open to negotiation. However, $115 is still higher than the value you're willing to pay.  By rejecting this offer, you can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're increasing your offer from $100 to $105, showing you're willing to negotiate.  This amount is still below Alice's last offer and within your budget, leaving room for a potential deal. This approach demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a good price."
