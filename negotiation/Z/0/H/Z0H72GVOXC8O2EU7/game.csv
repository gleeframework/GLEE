,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $14000? It's a significant discount from the original price, but it's still a great value for this amazing product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. Can you see your way to meeting me at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $12500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a significant concession from my original price, and I think it's a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Can you meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,9,

I'm sorry to hear that you're reaching the limit of your concessions. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Could we discuss a price of $12500?,12500.0,Bob,10,
