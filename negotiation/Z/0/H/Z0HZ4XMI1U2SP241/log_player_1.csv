{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its potential for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm highlighting the product's value for Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute maximum price, leaving space for potential counteroffers and a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while still allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a step closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's room to improve the price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee me $1,000,000. However, by continuing the negotiation, I have the chance to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,080,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My counteroffer is $1,115,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's proposal but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Compromise Language:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer represents a compromise to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefits:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for both of us to benefit from the deal.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to go lower than $1,115,000 at this point, as that's still a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I believe we can find a more equitable solution. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for you while significantly reducing the cost for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price point. 
* **Acceptable Profit:**  A sale at $1,100,000 still provides me with a significant profit and exceeds my minimum acceptable value.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price, and there's a chance that Bob might become less interested in the deal. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
