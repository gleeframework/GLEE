"Bob, I believe this product holds tremendous value for you, just as it does for me. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This reflects its unique qualities and potential. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that premium. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable offer, it doesn't fully capture the product's unique advantages and potential. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for further negotiation if needed. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to consider it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
