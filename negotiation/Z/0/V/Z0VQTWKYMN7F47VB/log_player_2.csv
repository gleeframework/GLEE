"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $8,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $9,200 saves you $2,800 compared to John's offer."
