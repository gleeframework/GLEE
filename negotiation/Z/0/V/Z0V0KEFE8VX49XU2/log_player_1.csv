Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but I believe it's a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's high value to me. If Bob rejects, we can then gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a good deal. This counteroffer should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I still get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired range, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit while minimizing potential losses."
