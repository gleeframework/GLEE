"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal if you're willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if you come down to $13,500.  I'm eager to finalize this purchase, but need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is getting closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. I understand you may have a different valuation, but I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $13,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think it's time for you to meet me halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,750. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13750.0,Alice,9,
