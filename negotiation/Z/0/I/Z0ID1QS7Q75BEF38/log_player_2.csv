"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what you're currently paying for similar items in the market. Considering its quality and exclusivity, I propose we set the price at $95. This way, you're getting a great deal while also acknowledging the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $95 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $70? I'm ready to buy right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** We acknowledge Alice's offer and the product's value, building rapport for a smoother negotiation.
* **Clear target:** We aim low ($70) to leave room for negotiation while staying significantly below our $80 maximum.
* **Sense of urgency:** By mentioning ""ready to buy right now,"" we incentivize Alice to consider our offer seriously.

This counteroffer is a strategic starting point. It allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and leaves space for potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I would like to accommodate you, I must maintain a fair pricing strategy. I am willing to negotiate further, so how about we aim for a price of $85? I believe this strikes a balance between fairness and value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit closer to our desired price, but $85 is still above our $80 limit. We should continue negotiating,  but be ready to walk away and buy from John if Alice won't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  We recognize Alice's effort to find a compromise, keeping the tone positive.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We propose a price directly between our last offer ($70) and her current one ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Reiterating our readiness to buy now adds a bit of pressure for Alice to accept. 

By now, Alice likely understands we have an alternative option. This offer makes it clear we're serious but also reaching our limit."
