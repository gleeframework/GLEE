"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique value proposition this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which shows my genuine interest. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. To be completely transparent, I'm willing to let this go for $1,700,000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to maximize your return, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant step towards your price and shows my genuine desire to come to a deal. Let's try to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
