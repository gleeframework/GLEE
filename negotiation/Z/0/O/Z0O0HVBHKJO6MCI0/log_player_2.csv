"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's definitely too early to accept Alice's offer.  You're looking to save as much as possible, and $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $850,000 is a significant step away from what I had in mind. Let's try and find a middle ground - how about we settle at $1,000,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to your target, it's still a bit high.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best move at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  To make this work, I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding of the product's value. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its true worth. To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is close to your target, you're still trying to save as much as you can. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can make a counteroffer, but if it fails, you are likely to buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're committed to that price, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $925,000. It's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another option."", ""product_price"": 925000}
