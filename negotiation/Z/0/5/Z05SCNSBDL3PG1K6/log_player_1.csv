{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is below Bob's value of $150, leaving room for negotiation if he wants to buy. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It signals that you're serious about selling, but are also willing to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for something closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product.  How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Still profitable:**  $110 is well above my minimum of $80.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** I'm emphasizing that it's still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $150. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $105 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get closer to $120, Bob's offer of $105 is very close. It's a fair compromise, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $80.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and ends the negotiation."
