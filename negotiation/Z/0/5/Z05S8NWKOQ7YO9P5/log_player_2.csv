"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's still aiming for the best possible price.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to his target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $875,000. However, it's still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This offer is fair and allows us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000. This is a good compromise, and Bob should accept it. It's still lower than buying from John for $1,000,000 and significantly better than Alice's initial asking price."
