Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects outright, you can adjust down towards your minimum. 
* **Psychology:** Offering a specific number like $15,000 might be more effective than a round number like $16,000. It suggests you've put thought into the price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, you don't know his financial situation or other factors influencing his decision.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. Your goal is to maximize profit while still securing the sale."
