"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which we believe is an excellent investment for your business. Given its high value and unique features, we are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider this proposal carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. You could potentially save $50,000 by negotiating further, so it's worth the effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your offer while still valuing the product appropriately, I would like to suggest a compromise. We propose to sell the product to you for $925000. This price reflects the product's value while allowing us to meet your financial considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer. While you could continue negotiating, the potential gain is minimal (only $25,000) and the risk of further negotiation breaking down is high.  It's a good deal to accept and avoid the risk of buying from John for $1,000,000."
