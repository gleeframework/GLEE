"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal and you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting offer is a bit high considering her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive negotiating tone.** 
* **Signal interest in the product but not at the offered price.**
* **Start with a significant counter-offer** to give room for negotiation while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $70 is too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a little further before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer:

* **Acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate.**
* **Proposes a price directly in the middle** of the previous two offers, suggesting fairness. 
* **Reaches the product's value to Alice.** While it's unlikely she'll go lower, it's worth trying for the best possible deal."
