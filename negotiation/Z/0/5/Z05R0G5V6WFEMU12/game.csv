"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $10,750 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? That's my final offer.",10875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $10,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal.",10750.0,Bob,8,
