{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a higher price and see where we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would have preferred a higher price, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation.  There's always a chance Bob could become more stubborn, and I don't want to risk losing this sale entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
