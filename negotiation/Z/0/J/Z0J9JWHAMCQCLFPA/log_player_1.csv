Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $115 is above your minimum price of $100, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to negotiate a price that is mutually beneficial. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, and it shows you're open to negotiation.

This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price from Bob, but it also gives you the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is above your minimum, it's still lower than the price you initially offered. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your bargaining power:**  It shows you're not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Explore potential for a higher offer:** You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, you can always go with the sure $100 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still protecting your interests. 
* **Meet halfway:** It offers a price that's in the middle of your previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105).
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** $110 is still above your minimum price of $100, ensuring you earn a decent profit. 

This approach keeps the negotiations moving forward while increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm willing to make a decision soon, so let me know if that's something you can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:** $108 is just $8 below your minimum acceptable price, but it's still a profit for you.
* **Negotiations are stalled:**  It seems Bob is firm on his price, and further negotiation might just lead to a longer process without a guarantee of a higher price.
* **Time pressure:** Bob mentions a need for a quick decision, implying he might walk away if you don't accept. 

It's better to secure the $108 rather than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for $100."
