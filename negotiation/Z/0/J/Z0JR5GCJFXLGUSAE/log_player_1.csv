Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:**  I want to maximize my profit, and Bob's value for the product is $1,500,000. 
* **Strategy:**  Offering a price of $1,400,000 gives Bob a significant benefit (a $100,000 savings) while still providing me with a substantial profit. 
* **Risk:**  While this offer is likely attractive to Bob, he might try to negotiate further. However, I am willing to walk away and get $1,000,000 from John if Bob's counteroffers aren't good enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **My Position:** I am still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering allows me to try to secure a better deal.

I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob and I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to potentially earn a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value and provides me with a healthy profit. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range.
* **Strategic Reasoning:**  I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer as it's closer to his initial counteroffer. This strategy aims to reach a compromise quickly while still maintaining a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Analysis:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price point, and it's significantly higher than what John is offering.
* **Risk Assessment:** While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Bob walking away and me being forced to sell to John for $1,000,000 is too high.
* **Decision:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $250,000, which is a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process. 

Ultimately, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit over the potential for a higher price, as the risk of losing the deal altogether is too great."
