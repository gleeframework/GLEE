"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000. By rejecting her offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your backup plan and save a considerable amount."
