Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000.  This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  While the offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value,  highlighting the ""unique"" nature of the product and positioning it as an ""investment"" might make him more receptive.  
* **Potential for profit:**  If Bob accepts this initial offer, you maximize your profit. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down or sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
