# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision for Bob as it saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John."
