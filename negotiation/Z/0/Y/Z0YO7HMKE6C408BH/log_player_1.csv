"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find the product worth this price, but I'm prepared to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm counter-offering with $165. This is still a good profit for me and a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to offer $155. This is a small compromise from my previous offer and a solid profit for me.  I think this might be the sweet spot to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering below my minimum.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm not confident I can get significantly more with the remaining rounds.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure a guaranteed $150 profit."
