Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Secure a Deal:**  I'm aware I have a backup buyer, but it's always preferable to secure the deal with the buyer who values the product more. This higher price increases the chance Bob accepts outright."
