Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $6,400. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,400.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough spot. Alice is signaling this is her best offer, but it's a significant jump back from her previous counteroffer.  I'll try one more time to meet in the middle, but I'm seriously considering John's offer if there's no movement."
