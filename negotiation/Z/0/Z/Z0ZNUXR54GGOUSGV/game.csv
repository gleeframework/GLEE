"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $6,500. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value the product brings to your business.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I agree the product is valuable. However, I was hoping to find something closer to $5,000. Would you be open to that?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $6,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also showing I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",6200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $6,400. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",6400.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've been giving this offer serious thought, but $6,400 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $6,000. I think that's a fair deal considering we've both made concessions.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,6,
