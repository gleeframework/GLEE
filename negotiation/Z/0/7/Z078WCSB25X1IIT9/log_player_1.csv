Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's very interested.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" and time-limited adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I am unable to directly reveal my guaranteed sale to John. If I could reveal that information, I could potentially negotiate an even higher price with Bob."
