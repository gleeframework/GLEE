,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $112. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle at $108?  It's a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $108. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product at $115. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $110. This way, we both get a deal we can be happy with.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $110. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. I'll offer you the product at $116. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",116.0,Alice,7,
