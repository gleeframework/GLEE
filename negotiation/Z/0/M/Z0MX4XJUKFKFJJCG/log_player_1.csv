"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is still above my minimum and leaves some room for further negotiation. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum and I'm confident I won't get a significantly better price by continuing the negotiation.  It's better to secure a sale now and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
