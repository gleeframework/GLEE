I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price.  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I have some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, I'm not willing to sell for $1,100,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price given Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not comfortable going any lower than $1,200,000, which is what John is willing to pay. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John and avoid further negotiations."
