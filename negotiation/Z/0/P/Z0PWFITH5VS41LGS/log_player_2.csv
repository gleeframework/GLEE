"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's within your budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffers are possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer allows you to try and secure a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations fail, you can still buy the product from John, ensuring you get it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to me.  While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  $850,000 is still a good profit for Alice (as the product is worth $800,000 to her). 
* **Sets a clear expectation:** This establishes a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to find a compromise. This price reflects the true value and potential of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your desired price:**  $900,000 is a good price, but you can potentially get it for even less.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  You've already established a range with your previous counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal.
* **John's offer is a backup:** If negotiations falter, you have the option to purchase from John. 

**Next steps:** Counter-offer Alice with a price slightly higher than your previous offer, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high. How about $875,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:**  It aims for a price halfway between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintain a friendly tone, reminding Alice you're trying to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. How about we settle at $887,500? This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:**  Alice's offer is just $25,000 above your last counteroffer and is a significant drop from her original price.
* **Time is running out:**  You're halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to reject offers could lead to a deadlock and force you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $887,500 is a good price for you, considering the value of the product to Alice and the potential risk of buying from John.

**Next steps:**  Accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
