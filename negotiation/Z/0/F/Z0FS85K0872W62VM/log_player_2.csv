"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. While I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, there's a good chance I can negotiate a much better price. It's too early to buy from John at his high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? "",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I've started with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's opening, but still well above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate, and hopefully, Alice will be open to moving closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,050,000 is still a long way from a price I'd consider a ""great deal."" I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer to see if I can get her closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about buying this product, but I need a price that works for me. How about $950,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I've made a smaller counteroffer this round, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit. By framing it as a ""significant compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge Alice into making a more substantial move next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I appreciate the compromise.  $950,000 is getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and go with $1,000,000? It's still a good value for you, and it gets me closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is definitely feeling the pressure, but $1,000,000 is still too high. We are getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation, so I need to start pushing a bit harder to see how much Alice is really willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer, but I need you to meet me a bit more on this. I'm willing to offer $960,000. That's a very strong offer, and I think it's fair given where we've landed in the negotiation."",
""product_price"": 960000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I've increased my offer slightly, but not by much. This signals to Alice that I'm serious about my price limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate in good faith. The goal is to make her sweat a bit and see if she's willing to accept a price closer to $950,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're really serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to go higher. However,  $960,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's meet halfway again - how about $980,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $980,000 is a solid price, well below my maximum and a significant saving from both Alice's opening offer and John's backup price. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice might dig in her heels. This offer represents a fair compromise and ensures I get the product without the risk of the deal falling through."
