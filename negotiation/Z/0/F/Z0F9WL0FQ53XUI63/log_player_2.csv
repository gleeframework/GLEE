"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is your limit, there's no reason to pay that much right away. You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (25%) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating. This also gives you room to compromise in future rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for improvement. You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has signaled a willingness to come down from her initial price.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a good sign she's open to negotiation.  A counteroffer of $800,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing you are willing to meet her halfway but still getting a good deal.  This strategy should keep the negotiation moving and get us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $850,000 is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a worse outcome or even a stalemate. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking a higher price or losing the opportunity to buy from John."
