{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and has the potential to be incredibly valuable for the right person. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. This is a common tactic in sales. 
* **Showing Enthusiasm:** My message is friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which can make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer.

**Important Notes:**

* **My floor is $1,000,000:** I won't sell for less than this, as it's my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000. This allows me to be more aggressive with Bob.
* **This is just the first offer:**  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be happy to buy it for $1200000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my starting price of $1,500,000.  However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price. I can use the next round to try and bridge the gap between his offer and my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's a bit below where I need to be right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for you. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price to $1,350,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's unique value and potential. This keeps his interest high.
* **Confidence:** I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  This helps maintain a positive tone during negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a good idea of how close Bob is to accepting a deal.
* **Maintaining Control:** By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I demonstrate that I'm in control of the negotiation and not pressured to accept a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1300000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,350,000. This means we're almost at a mutually agreeable price.  

* **Close to My Goal:**  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and a good outcome for me. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away completely or driving the price down further.  Accepting this offer minimizes that risk.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic decision. While I could potentially try to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the potential gains are not worth the risk of him rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John for a lower price."
