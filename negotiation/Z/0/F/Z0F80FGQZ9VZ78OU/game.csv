"Alice, thank you for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be happy to buy it for $1200000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1200000 is tempting, it's a bit below where I need to be right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for you. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1300000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
