"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?  I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one? Would you be willing to do $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up a little bit. How about $8,000? That's the very top of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,6,
