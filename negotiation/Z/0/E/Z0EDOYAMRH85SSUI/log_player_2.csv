"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is a significant markup. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $150 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get her down further. It's better to secure the product from John at my desired price."
