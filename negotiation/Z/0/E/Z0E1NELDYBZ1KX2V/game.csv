"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
