"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that number?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $8,500, which is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which represents a significant compromise from my original offer.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
