"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000, but I'm not flexible beyond that. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  While $11000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $9500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
