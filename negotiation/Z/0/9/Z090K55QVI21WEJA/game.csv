"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to $100? Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
