Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $15,000, Alice can gauge Bob's interest. If Bob accepts, Alice gets a great deal. If Bob declines, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has John as a backup buyer at $10,000.
* **Confident Language:** The message to Bob uses confident language (""significant value"") to emphasize the product's worth without revealing Alice's bottom line.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on how aggressively Alice wants to negotiate and her risk tolerance."
