"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your target, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be open to that?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000. I can offer you a price of $1,220,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1220000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would $1,185,000 work for you?",1185000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your target, and I'd like to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,9,
