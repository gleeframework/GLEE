"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a price. However, my budget for this purchase is quite limited. Could we perhaps find a middle ground? I am willing to pay $750000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed the product's features again and am still very interested. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price. How about $800000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
