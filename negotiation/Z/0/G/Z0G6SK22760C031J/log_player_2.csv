"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has immense value, particularly for someone like you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit handsomely while ensuring I receive a significant return on my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it.  This price is fair considering your own valuation and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a clear message acknowledging Alice's offer but suggesting a lower price. The $950,000 offer is significantly lower than Alice's price, leaving room for negotiation. It also highlights that the price is still beneficial for Alice, considering her own valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $950000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite in line with my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to come down to $1050000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a much better price for Bob than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate a bit further, the risk of Alice walking away and the potential for further negotiation to take a long time makes accepting the offer a safer and more cost-effective option."
