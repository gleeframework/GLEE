"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has immense value, particularly for someone like you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit handsomely while ensuring I receive a significant return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe $1200000 is a bit too high for me. Considering its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950000 for it.  This price is fair considering your own valuation and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $950000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite in line with my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to come down to $1050000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
