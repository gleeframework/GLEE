Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe $1200000 is a bit too high for me. Considering its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950000 for it.  This price is fair considering your own valuation and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
