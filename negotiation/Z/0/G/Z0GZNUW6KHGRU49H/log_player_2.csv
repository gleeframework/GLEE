**Reasoning:**

Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to go below $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as she might even harden her stance.  Cutting our losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 ensures we get the product without the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome with Alice."
