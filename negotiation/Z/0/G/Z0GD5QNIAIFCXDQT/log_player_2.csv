"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product. While her offer of $14,000 is under your $15,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for a counter-offer or can proceed with your backup plan of buying from John and still stay within your budget."
