"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at a price that is below your maximum budget of $80. Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product at a significant discount and saves you $16. It's more beneficial than waiting to see if you can get a better deal in the next rounds, considering you could end up paying more or even having to buy from John at $80."
