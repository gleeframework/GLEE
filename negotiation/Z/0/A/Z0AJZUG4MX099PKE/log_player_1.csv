{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll be getting a valuable asset for a good price, and I'll be able to move this quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids any ambiguity and allows Bob to easily understand your offer.
* **It highlights the benefits for both parties:** This makes the offer more appealing and increases the likelihood of acceptance.

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response.  If he rejects it, you can consider lowering the price slightly, but be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price falls too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's still a great price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can get closer to that number.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This gives you a great price on a valuable product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is a good balance between your desired price and Bob's offer.  

* **It's a compromise:** This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate, which can increase his trust and likelihood of accepting. 
* **It's still profitable for you:** You're getting closer to your desired price while maintaining a good profit margin.
* **It's clear and concise:** This avoids any confusion and allows Bob to easily understand your proposal. 

Remember, you can adjust this offer based on Bob's response, but you have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, so you have the upper hand in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not quite where you want it to be.  You're very close to your guaranteed sale with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $935,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both. You get a great deal on a valuable product, and I can secure a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

This counteroffer is a small compromise but still keeps you closer to your desired profit margin.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward towards a potential agreement.

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It shows continued willingness to negotiate:** You're not digging your heels in, but you're also not giving away too much.
* **It's a smaller gap:** The difference between your offer and Bob's is now only $15,000, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 
* **It's still profitable for you:** You're getting closer to your desired profit margin while maintaining a good deal for both parties.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response, but keep in mind the $1,200,000 offer from John.  Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to your minimum, but it's still not enough to meet your desired profit margin. You've already had several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to close the gap significantly. With John offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's time to move on. You've made a good effort to negotiate with Bob, but it's not worth risking a lower profit for the sake of a few more rounds of negotiation."
