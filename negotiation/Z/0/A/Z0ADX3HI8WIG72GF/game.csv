"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.  Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit off on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,400. I'm getting close to my target, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can get to a mutually agreeable price.",8400.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $8,400 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,600.  Let's close this deal and move on.",8600.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit off on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm not willing to go much lower than that, so let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",8500.0,Bob,8,
