"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and it gives you a good opportunity to make a profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's best to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  There's a chance that Alice may be willing to go even lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and hopefully closer to what you're looking for. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $900,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum expectation. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the product's worth and allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. With several rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his target. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go even lower to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can realistically afford. I'm prepared to pay $910,000.  This is a fair compromise that's within my budget and hopefully a good value for you.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both willing to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $915,000.  This is a fair price that respects our respective positions.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $800,000. Even though Alice's offer is very close to Bob's budget, Bob still has a few more rounds to negotiate and might be able to get a lower price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go down to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However,  $915,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is the absolute best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a win. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
