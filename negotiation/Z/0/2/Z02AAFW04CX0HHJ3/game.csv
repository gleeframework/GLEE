"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $800,000 is a tough number for me to move on. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer at that price.  However, I believe in being fair and you were my first offer.  If you'd be willing to meet me at $850,000, we have a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
