"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room to negotiate further. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to push the price down closer to his initial counteroffer of $950,000."
