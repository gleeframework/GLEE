Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $15,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product.

Keep in mind that this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adapt based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to your minimum, but you can likely get more.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  That would be a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13750}
