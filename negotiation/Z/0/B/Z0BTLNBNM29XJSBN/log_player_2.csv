"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $850,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice is hoping to get closer to her ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $600,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer.  This should signal my serious intent to purchase but also my desire for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $725,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite high. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to overpay. I'm hoping that this will lead to a quick agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down in price, and $700,000 is a good price. I'm comfortable with this price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's also worth noting that we are halfway through the negotiation process. It's unlikely that Alice will drop her price much further, and if we reject this offer, we may end up buying from John at a much higher price."
