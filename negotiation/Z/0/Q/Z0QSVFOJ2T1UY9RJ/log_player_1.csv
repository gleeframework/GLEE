{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always keep the option of selling to John for $8,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price of $8,500. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $8,000, $7,800 is a good price and is very close to my minimum. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000, and it avoids further negotiation."
