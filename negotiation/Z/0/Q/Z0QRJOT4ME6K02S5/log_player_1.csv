Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of the value difference (Bob's value - your value = $200,000) as possible.  Since Bob doesn't know your minimum, you have room to negotiate above $1,000,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, but still secures you a significant portion of the value difference.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as fair, not a starting point for extreme haggling.
* **No Mention of John:**  Revealing your backup buyer could weaken your position.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could start higher, but be prepared to potentially negotiate down if Bob pushes back."
