"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this counteroffer. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This reflects the product's significant worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a revised counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise further if necessary. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
