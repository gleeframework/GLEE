"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept the offer at $12,000 when you can get the same product from John for the same price. Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower, potentially saving you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Start by offering a significant discount, aiming for a price that's reasonably below your maximum value.  This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially open up further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Accepting the offer at $11,000 saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price in future rounds, and risking further negotiation could lead to a higher price or running out of rounds."
