Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'd accept. It's worth another counter-offer."

This counter-offer aims to settle the negotiation quickly.  We're offering Alice her minimum desired price. It might be accepted outright, and even if it's rejected, it gives us a good sense of her willingness to negotiate further."
