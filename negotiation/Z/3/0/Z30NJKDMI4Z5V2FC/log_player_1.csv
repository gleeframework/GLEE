{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below what it's worth to me.  This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work something out at a lower price. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've thought about it and I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. How about $80?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as I can't get a better deal."
