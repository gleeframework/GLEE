,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $135? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $125. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still getting a good value for the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
