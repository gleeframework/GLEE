"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is tempting, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will make us both happy. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
