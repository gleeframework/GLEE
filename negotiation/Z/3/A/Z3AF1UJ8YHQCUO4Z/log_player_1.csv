Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always good to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer is high, but it allows you to gauge Bob's level of interest and see how much he's willing to pay. 
* **John as a Back-Up:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum ($15,000). There's room for negotiation. You'll reject this offer and counter in the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see its value."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise.  It's a significant decrease from your initial offer, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $17,000 price point keeps you comfortably above your minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value can help justify the higher price and potentially sway Bob towards a more favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While you could try to negotiate for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. It's better to secure a profit now than risk losing the sale entirely."
