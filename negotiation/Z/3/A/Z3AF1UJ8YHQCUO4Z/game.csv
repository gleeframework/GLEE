,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see its value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",14000.0,Bob,4,
