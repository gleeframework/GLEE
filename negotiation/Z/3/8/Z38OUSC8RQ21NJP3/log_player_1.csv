Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation, making it less likely for him to immediately reject the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high increases the chance of getting a higher final price.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By being open to negotiation, Bob might be more willing to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I can always choose to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even lower than my initial offer of $175.  It is clear that Bob is trying to get a very low price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept such a low offer. 

Instead, I'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price while still being competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a good deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $60 but still lower than my initial offer of $175. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while firmly stating my position. It also attempts to frame the offer as a good deal for Bob, which could encourage him to consider it.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balanced Approach:** This counteroffer attempts to balance the need to maximize profit with the need to remain competitive and keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm still open to negotiation and willing to lower my price, but not so low that it becomes unprofitable for me.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By offering a significant reduction from my initial offer, I signal a willingness to compromise, which might make Bob more likely to reciprocate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $70 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.  It's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a profitable outcome. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, I will choose to sell the product to him to ensure I get a fair price. This decision allows me to maximize my earnings and avoid potentially wasting more time on a negotiation that is unlikely to be successful."
