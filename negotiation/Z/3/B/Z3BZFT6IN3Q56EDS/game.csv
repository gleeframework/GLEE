"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm still a bit attached to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $135 is still a little too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $130.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $132.50? It's a small adjustment, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm really close to making a decision, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $131.25.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'll be happy with the product. ",131.25,Bob,6,
