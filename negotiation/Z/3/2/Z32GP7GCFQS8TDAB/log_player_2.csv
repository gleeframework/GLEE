"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $120 is too high for you. You're willing to pay $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
$100 is still more than you are willing to pay. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer, I'm still aiming to keep it at $80. It's my budget limit, and I'd really like to make this work. Let's try to find common ground, maybe something in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $80, which would be $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've already rejected two offers from Alice at prices higher than your budget.  While $90 is closer to your $80 target, Alice has shown she's unwilling to go lower. It's better to go with John's guaranteed $80 price than risk further negotiations with Alice."
