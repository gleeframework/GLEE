"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a relatively high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me some room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a good price. I also want to show confidence in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has expressed interest and acknowledged the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to show you my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to compromise while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not ready to settle for $775,000, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $800,000. I want to see if I can push Bob further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to lower my price to $825,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope you'll see it as a fair offer.  Let's finalise this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still slightly above my minimum acceptable price. This shows continued willingness to negotiate while trying to maximize my profit.  I'm also adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $795,000 is only $5,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached Round 6 and I'm concerned that further negotiations might drag on and potentially result in a lower offer. 

Given that John is willing to pay $800,000, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him. It's a sure deal with a reasonable profit margin.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale with John by continuing negotiations with Bob."
