"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's offer.  There's a good chance Bob could continue negotiating and get a lower price, but the risk is that Alice might walk away or that Bob could run out of rounds before getting a better price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice, balancing savings with potential risk."
