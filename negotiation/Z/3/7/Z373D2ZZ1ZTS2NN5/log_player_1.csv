"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high sale price.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential""  attempts to justify the high price without revealing specific information. 
* **Open Communication:** Inviting Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage in the negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest** and potential for a high sale.
2. **Establish a negotiation space** that favors you.

Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum price at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table.  You started with a high anchor, and it seems Bob is willing to engage in a back-and-forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said,  $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the value I know this product holds."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** You are making a significant concession from your initial price, signaling flexibility. However, you are still staying well above both Bob's offer and your minimum price. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  You are again emphasizing the product's value without being specific. The goal is to subtly shift Bob's perception of what a fair price might be.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay and how he responds to your negotiation tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product has a lot of value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,750,000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and moving closer to your desired range. While $1,750,000 is a good offer, you have the leverage to push a bit further in these next few rounds.  There's still a potential $250,000 profit to be made."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,750,000 is close, but I need a price that truly reflects the value of what you're getting. How about we land at $1,900,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  Showing Bob you recognize his effort keeps him engaged in the negotiation.
* **Small Concession:** You're making a smaller concession now ($100,000), signaling that you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Finality:** The phrasing ""land at"" and ""fair compromise"" suggests this is a strong offer and you're aiming for a deal close to this point. 

You're now getting a sense of Bob's potential price ceiling. Be prepared to consider offers around $1,800,000-$1,850,000 in the next couple of rounds, as he may not go above that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,800,000 is a $300,000 profit over your minimum. While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, it's getting riskier.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob explicitly stated this is his highest offer.  Pushing further might make him walk away. 
* **Time:** You've used half the rounds, and while you have time, securing a good deal now eliminates uncertainty. 

This is a solid offer where you've maximized your potential without jeopardizing the sale."
