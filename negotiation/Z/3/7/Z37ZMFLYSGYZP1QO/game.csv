"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $150 to me.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $127.50. Can you consider that?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate that.  However, $127.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $129.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $129 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $127.50, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $128? That way, we can both be happy with the deal.",128.0,Bob,6,
