"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the unique value of the product, but I'm working with a tight budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get a deal done.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  Would you be open to $900,000?  I feel that's a fair price and would allow me to make this purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. I'm confident that you'll find it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $925,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget ceiling. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'd like to make one more concession to get the deal done. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $920,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
