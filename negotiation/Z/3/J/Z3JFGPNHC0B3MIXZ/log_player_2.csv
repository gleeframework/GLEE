# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget of $15,000. While she emphasizes the product's value, you don't have any information to determine if it's truly worth that much. 

Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price, it makes sense to go with John. This eliminates any risk of overpaying based on Alice's potentially inflated valuation."
