Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's my safety net with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures I get a good price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $150 outright might scare Bob off. By presenting a slightly lower price, I appear more open to negotiation and increase the chances of a sale."
