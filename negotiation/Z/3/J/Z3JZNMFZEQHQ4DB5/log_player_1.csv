Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $130 is below my minimum, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $130 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $140? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $140 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and it's better to secure the sale than risk getting nothing at all."
