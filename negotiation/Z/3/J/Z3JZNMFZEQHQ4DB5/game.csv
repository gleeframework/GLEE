"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a budget. Can you meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $130 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $140? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",140.0,Bob,4,
