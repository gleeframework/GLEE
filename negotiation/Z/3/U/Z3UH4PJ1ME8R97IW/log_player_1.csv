I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm taking a calculated risk by setting the price high, hoping that Bob values the product enough to pay a premium. If he rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I receive at least $1,000,000."
