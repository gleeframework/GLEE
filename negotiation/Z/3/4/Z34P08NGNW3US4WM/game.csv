"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you in the long run.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a good compromise. This would allow for a fair profit for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
