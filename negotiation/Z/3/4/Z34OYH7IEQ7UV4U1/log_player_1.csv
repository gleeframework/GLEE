Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price equal to John's offer sets a strong anchor. While it's the maximum Bob might consider, it establishes the product's value in his mind.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Offering John's price doesn't leave room for Bob to haggle. This signals that the price is firm and based on the product's true worth. 
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. There's no risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable potentially losing Bob as a buyer. 
*  There's a chance Bob might be offended by the high price, even if it's justified.

**Alternative Approach (Riskier):**

Alice could try to gauge Bob's interest level first to personalize the offer. This involves more risk but could lead to a higher sale price if Bob is highly motivated."
