Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, given my current financial situation. Let me know if that's a possibility for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

While $1,300,000 is my ideal price point, I'm willing to negotiate to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe this price reflects a significant compromise while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my range, but I'm getting closer.  How about $950,000? This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident it would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, the difference between his current offer and John's standing offer is too small to risk further negotiation.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
