"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, given my current financial situation. Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,300,000 is my ideal price point, I'm willing to negotiate to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe this price reflects a significant compromise while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down.  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my range, but I'm getting closer.  How about $950,000? This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident it would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
