"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also being reasonable for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
