"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $875000.

"I understand that this is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to accept $860000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable selling the product at this price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $880000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",880000.0,Alice,9,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $860000, and I think that's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had. I'm willing to make one final offer of $860000, but I'm not sure if you'll accept it. If not, I'll have to consider buying the product from John.",860000.0,Bob,10,
