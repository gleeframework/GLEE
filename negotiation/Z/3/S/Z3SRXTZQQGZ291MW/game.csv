"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  Let's cut to the chase - I need to secure at least $1,000,000 for this product.  If you can meet that, we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
