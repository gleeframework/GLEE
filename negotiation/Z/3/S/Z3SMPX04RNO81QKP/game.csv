"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a compromise at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,012,500? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,012,500 is the right price. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $975,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I'm afraid we're at an impasse. I've been very flexible on price, but I can't justify going any lower than $1,000,000. I'm confident this product can bring you significant value, but if you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options. I do have another interested buyer, and while I'd prefer to close this deal with you, I need to be mindful of my business interests.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
