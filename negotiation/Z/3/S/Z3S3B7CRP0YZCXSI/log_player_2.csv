"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer is $135, which is still within Bob's budget.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and the price might end up higher.  
* **Time Constraint:** With only 10 rounds, it's important to consider the time factor.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
