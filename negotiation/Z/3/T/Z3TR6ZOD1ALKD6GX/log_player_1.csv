"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $100. I'm also setting the stage for a potential counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is still a decent profit, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping that Bob is serious about buying the product and will come up with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $125. This is a good profit for me, and I'm getting closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
