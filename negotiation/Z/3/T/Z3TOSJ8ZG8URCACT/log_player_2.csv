"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a decent offer considering the product's value to Alice is $8,000. This should give Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, Bob can still try to get a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $12,500? I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still less than Alice's current offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
