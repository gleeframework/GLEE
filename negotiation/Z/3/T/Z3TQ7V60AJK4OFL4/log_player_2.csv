"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80."", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we try $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $120, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at $100 than risk Alice not going low enough and missing out entirely."
