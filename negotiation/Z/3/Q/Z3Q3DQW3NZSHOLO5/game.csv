"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  That's still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $7,500 is still a little bit outside my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would work for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
