"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,200,000), but still above your maximum budget ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and make another counteroffer to try to get a lower price."
