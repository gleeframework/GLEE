"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,375,000, as I believe that represents a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
