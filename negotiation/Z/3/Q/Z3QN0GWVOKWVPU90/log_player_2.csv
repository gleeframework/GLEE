{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still more than Alice's value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is still a good deal for him as it's within his budget. It also gives Alice some room to negotiate, as it's higher than her value of $12,000. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,200 is still within Bob's budget, it's closer to his maximum price point and Alice is only increasing her offer by a small amount.  There's still room for negotiation and a potential for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $13,500. This is still a good deal for him, and it's closer to Alice's last offer of $14,200. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise but is still trying to get a price closer to his initial offer.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at $14,300.  This is still within Bob's budget and closer to his counteroffer of $13,500.  It's likely that Alice will not go lower and Bob doesn't want to risk going back and forth anymore, potentially causing Alice to walk away. 

Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product within his budget, and he only slightly exceeds his initial goal of saving as much money as possible."
