"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for both of us, given its value and your interest. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the value of the product and acknowledging his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $95. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $95. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $95, which is below my minimum. I've already countered, and it seems unlikely he'll budge further. To avoid risking further rounds and potentially losing out on a better deal, I'll sell to John for $100."
