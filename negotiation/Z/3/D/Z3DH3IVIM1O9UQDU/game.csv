"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a good deal for you. How about $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but $10000 is my absolute limit.  Let's close the deal at this price, as it's a fair value for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
