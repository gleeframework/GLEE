"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000? That's the maximum I can offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $16000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a little higher than I can comfortably go.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, which would be $15200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?",15200.0,Alice,5,
