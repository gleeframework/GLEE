"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price, but still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still allow me to get a fair price while also recognizing your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  It's a significant concession on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk that she won't budge. Buying from John guarantees the best price with no further hassle."
