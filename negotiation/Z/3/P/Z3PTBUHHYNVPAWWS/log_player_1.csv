"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

While I'd love to sell the product, $775,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
