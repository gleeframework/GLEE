"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price, but still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still allow me to get a fair price while also recognizing your budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  It's a significant concession on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
