{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always better to negotiate or find an alternative than to accept a price that's far beyond your comfort zone.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by proposing a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it signals to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to walk away if necessary.  This price is also well within your budget, leaving room for potential negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can either try to get closer to your desired price or explore John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you're serious about buying the product. However, it remains below your maximum budget and is closer to what you'd ideally like to pay. This approach aims to find a middle ground where both sides feel comfortable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.  While you could continue to negotiate with Alice, there's a risk she may not budge further, and you might end up paying more than you're comfortable with. John offers a guaranteed price within your budget, making it the most financially sound choice at this point."
