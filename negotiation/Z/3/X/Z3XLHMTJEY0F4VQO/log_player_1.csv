Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your $100 minimum, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **Below Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is lower than Bob's $150 value, giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 

This approach gives you a chance to get a good price while also keeping the negotiation open for a potentially better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. That's still a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $125 is a decent price, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's also significantly higher than selling to John. I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with a lower price."
