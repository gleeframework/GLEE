I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to get the deal done, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer is more enticing to Bob, and we can come to a mutually agreeable price."

Bob is being stubborn and unwilling to budge on his low offer. I've already lowered my price considerably, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better option than accepting Bob's low offer.  It guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
