"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
