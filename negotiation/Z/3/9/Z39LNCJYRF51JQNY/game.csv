"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,800. It's a bit lower than your original offer, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $13,650?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",13650.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $13,650. How about we try $13,200? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to save a bit more.",13200.0,Bob,4,
