Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond. 

By starting at $100, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price if he's willing to pay more.  Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell for his initial price.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his desired price but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not a price I'm willing to accept. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I don't want to sell for significantly below my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm still open to exploring options that are mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By dropping the price slightly to $90, I'm showing that I'm still willing to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Directness:**  The message is clear and concise, focusing on finding a solution that works for both parties. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $87 is still significantly lower than what I'd prefer.  The negotiation is starting to become more time-consuming, and I'm not convinced I can get a much better price from Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more reliable buyer like John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
