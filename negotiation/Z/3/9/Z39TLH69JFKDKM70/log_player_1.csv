Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is my absolute minimum.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. Can we try $12,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,200 is higher than what John is offering, and it's close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
