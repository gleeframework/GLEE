"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
