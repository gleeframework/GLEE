"I'm really interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1700000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1550000.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $1400000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1400000, and that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from someone else.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
