"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $95. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you. Alice is offering it for $95. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still more than the product is worth to her but less than the price John is offering.  Since the product is worth $100 to you, accepting the offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
