,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1200000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1400000. Can we discuss further?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
