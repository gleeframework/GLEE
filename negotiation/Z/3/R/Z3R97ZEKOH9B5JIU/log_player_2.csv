"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to someone like you.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return while still giving you a significant advantage. Let me know what you think.
