Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $10750 as a compromise. It's closer to my offer, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.
