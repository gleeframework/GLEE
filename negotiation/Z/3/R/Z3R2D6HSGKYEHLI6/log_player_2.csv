"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more for the product.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer will allow Bob to try and secure a lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, which gives Bob time to explore if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's try $10,750 as a compromise. It's closer to my offer, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
