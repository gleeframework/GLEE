"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal that's closer to your budget. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
