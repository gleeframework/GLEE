"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate further. There's a good chance Bob can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer is within Bob's budget, and it's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate further as she wants to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Since Alice is willing to negotiate further, Bob should attempt to lower the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a compromise between his previous offer of $1,250,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,300,000. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, while still staying within his budget. It's a reasonable offer that could incentivize Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's clear that Alice isn't willing to drop the price further to meet Bob's desired price.  Therefore, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $1,200,000.  This ensures he gets the product at his maximum price, avoiding any further negotiation with Alice."
