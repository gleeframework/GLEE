"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $925,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $862,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price and we're still significantly above John's offer. While we don't want to scare Bob off, we're aiming for the best possible price. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $890,000?  That's a significant concession on my end and a fair price for this quality."", 
""product_price"": 890000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the point where Bob's offer might exceed our guaranteed sale to John.  This counteroffer keeps a good amount above John's price while still showing flexibility and aiming to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $845,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now below our guaranteed sale price with John. While there's a chance Bob might come up slightly, it's too risky to continue. We have a sure $800,000 on the table and continuing the negotiation risks getting bogged down in a back-and-forth that might not even yield a better result."
