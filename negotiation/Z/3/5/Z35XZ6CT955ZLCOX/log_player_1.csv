Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
