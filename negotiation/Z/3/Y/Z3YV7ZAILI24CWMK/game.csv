"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and leaves room for discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous prices. How about $1,950,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value this product will bring to your business.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,950,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try to find a more realistic middle ground.  Would you consider $800,000 for the product?  This is my final offer, as I am also evaluating other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm prepared to make one final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential benefits this product offers you.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
