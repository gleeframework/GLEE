"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and leaves room for discussion. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while gauging Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price by emphasizing the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential,""  aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its value higher.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to actively participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While his offer is low, it signals some interest. I will counter in the next round, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous prices. How about $1,950,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant jump down from my initial offer, meeting Bob halfway between our previous prices. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:**  While the new price is a concession, it's still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This maintains pressure and reinforces the product's value.
* **Justification:** The message frames the concession as a calculated move to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It emphasizes the value the product offers Bob, aiming to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,950,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try to find a more realistic middle ground.  Would you consider $800,000 for the product?  This is my final offer, as I am also evaluating other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has now reached his perceived value of the product ($800,000). While it's closer to a potentially acceptable range, it's still below my minimum. His statement about it being his ""final offer"" and ""evaluating other options"" could be a negotiation tactic. I'll reject and present a strong counteroffer, making it clear I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm prepared to make one final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential benefits this product offers you.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting my significant compromise while reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the price.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" implies I'm willing to walk away from the deal and pursue John's offer, which Bob knows is higher than his current offer.
* **Strategic Price:** The price of $1,600,000 is still comfortably above my minimum while leaving some room for a final counter from Bob, should he be willing to negotiate further."
