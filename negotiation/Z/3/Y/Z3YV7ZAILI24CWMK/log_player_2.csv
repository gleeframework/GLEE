Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous prices. How about $1,950,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm prepared to make one final offer at $1,600,000.
