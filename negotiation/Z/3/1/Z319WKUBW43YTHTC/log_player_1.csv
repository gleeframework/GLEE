Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John ($100), which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my fallback option with John, I know the product is worth more to Bob ($120). I'll try to negotiate a better price before settling for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $108?"", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:**  I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Justification:**  The ""meet in the middle"" approach can be persuasive and seem fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product, I would like to counter with a price of $105. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $105 is a solid profit above my minimum ($100), and significantly closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might risk the deal, especially if Bob is getting impatient. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now prevents me from potentially wasting time on extended negotiations with an uncertain outcome."
