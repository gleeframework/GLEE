"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to sell you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than what John is offering, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $87.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is within your budget of $100 and still a decent saving compared to John's offer. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a good price."
