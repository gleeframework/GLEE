,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I could consider coming down to $10,500. This is a very reasonable offer considering its benefits.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $10,500 is still beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,4,
