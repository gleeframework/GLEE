Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000.  I think it would be a valuable asset for you, and this is a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps me understand how badly Bob wants the product. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have gone higher. If he negotiates, I can adjust accordingly.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and my initial offer.  This large gap suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this lowball offer and propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I could consider coming down to $10,500. This is a very reasonable offer considering its benefits."", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to signal flexibility. However, I'm staying firmly above my absolute minimum price of $10,000.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for the price (""true value"", ""reasonable offer"") to anchor the negotiation around worth, not just arbitrary numbers. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's willing to negotiate in this range, we might reach a deal. If he remains stuck at an extremely low price, I'll know to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $10,500 is still beyond my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchored at His Valuation:** Bob's counteroffer of $8,000 shows he's stuck on his initial perceived value and is unlikely to budge significantly higher.
* **Unlikely to Reach Agreement:**  Further negotiation with Bob might yield a small increase in his offer, but it's improbable we'll reach a price close to my $10,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
