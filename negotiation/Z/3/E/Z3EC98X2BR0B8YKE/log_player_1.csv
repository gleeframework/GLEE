Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is just a bit above my minimum acceptable price, it's still better than selling to John for $120.  I'm willing to take the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potential losses."
