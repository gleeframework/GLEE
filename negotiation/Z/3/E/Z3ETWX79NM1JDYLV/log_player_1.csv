"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This gives you room to maneuver and leaves Bob with the perception of a potential ""deal"" later on.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets a psychological anchor. While Bob knows his valuation is lower, the initial price influences his perception of what's reasonable. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth,"" we aim to justify the high price, even though Bob may not fully agree with our valuation.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I recognize its value, your starting price is quite high. I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While selling to John is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better deal than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to move down to $1,900,000. This reflects a more reasonable compromise while recognizing its inherent value."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Calculated Concession:** Coming down by $350,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but not desperation. 
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  The price remains comfortably above John's $1,500,000 offer, maintaining leverage.
* **Reiterating Value:** Continuing to emphasize the product's ""inherent value"" reinforces the idea that the price is justified.

This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation toward a mutually beneficial outcome while keeping us in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $950,000. This reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob increased his offer, $950,000 is still considerably less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob's offer increments and tone suggest he's willing to negotiate further. It's too early to settle.
* **Time Consideration:** We have six rounds remaining, allowing for further exploration of a mutually agreeable price.

Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Bob to improve his offer while signaling that we're serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer moves closer to Bob's range while staying above John's offer.  The $300,000 decrease is substantial enough to encourage Bob but still maintains a strong position.
* **Time Factor:** With six rounds left, we're getting into the latter half of the negotiation. This offer encourages Bob to reciprocate with more significant increases if he's serious.
* **Clear Justification:**  Reiterating the product's ""true worth"" reinforces that we're not simply making arbitrary concessions. This anchors the negotiation around value, not just price. 

This counteroffer balances firmness with a willingness to find common ground, aiming for a price that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I acknowledge your movement on the price. However, we need to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm proposing $1,100,000 as a final offer. This takes into account the product's value and my budget limitations.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's language (""final offer"") is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure us into accepting.  It's important not to fold under this pressure prematurely.
* **Still Below John:**  $1,100,000 remains significantly lower than John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While smaller, Bob's increases show he's willing to move. We have four rounds left, providing space to push for a better deal.

Rejecting now signals that we're serious about getting a fair price and are prepared to walk away if necessary. This can lead Bob to reconsider his ""final offer"" stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  My final offer is $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Leverage:** Revealing John's offer creates a sense of urgency and demonstrates that we have a strong alternative.  It also sets a clear floor for the negotiation.
* **Finality and Compromise:** By stating our ""final offer,"" we signal seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.  The significant $200,000 drop shows a willingness to compromise to close the deal.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price is strategically placed between Bob's last offer and John's offer, encouraging Bob to see it as a favorable solution. 

This counteroffer aims to secure the best possible price by leveraging our position while remaining open to a deal with Bob."
