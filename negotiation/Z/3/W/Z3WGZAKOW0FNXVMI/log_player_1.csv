Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and it's likely that if I reject it, he might be willing to pay a bit more. However, it's also possible that he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer. Given the risk, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision to guarantee a sale at a good price."
