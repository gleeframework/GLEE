Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price I like, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 108
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a reasonable saving compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
