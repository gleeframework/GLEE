"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push the price closer to my desired value before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only do it for $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher. I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also trying to be reasonable by suggesting a compromise.  I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $15,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $12,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him a little further. I still have 6 rounds left and can always sell to John for $15,000.  I think I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm open to a final offer of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be very valuable. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting this is my ""final offer"". I hope this will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I can go up to $13,000. It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value I see in the product. Let me know if this works for you, as I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I have 4 rounds left and can still sell to John for a better price. I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $13,000 is a respectable offer. However, I'm still holding out for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product and the time we've spent negotiating. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below John's price. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by reiterating that this is my final offer. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this price, as we're both getting closer to a deal."
