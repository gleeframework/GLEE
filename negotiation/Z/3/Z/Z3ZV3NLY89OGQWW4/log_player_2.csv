"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is quite high, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $812,500.

At this point, Alice is consistently meeting in the middle.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and there's a risk Alice will stop negotiating. $812,500 is a reasonable price, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk paying John's $1,000,000."
