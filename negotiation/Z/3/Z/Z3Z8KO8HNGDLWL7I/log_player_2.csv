{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to try and negotiate a lower price or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's much closer to my maximum budget. This will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay her asking price.  It will also give us some room to negotiate in the following rounds."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating and try to get her price lower.  Although John is a safe option, there's still potential to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still well below Alice's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but am still trying to get a price closer to my maximum budget.  With only 6 rounds left, I need to start moving toward a possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get her price lower.  There's still room to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal, especially with only 5 rounds remaining.  While John is a secure option, I'm committed to exploring all options to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but still within my maximum budget. This demonstrates my willingness to meet Alice halfway, but I'm leaving room for negotiation in the next rounds. With only four rounds remaining, it's important to show progress without jeopardizing my budget."
