"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but also be aware of the risk of Bob immediately rejecting and moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving down from my initial price but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not desperate, and I have the option of selling to John. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm taking a significant step down to show my willingness to compromise, but I'm not going any lower than my minimum acceptable price. This is a clear signal that I'm serious about closing a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I've made significant concessions already, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of Bob not accepting any further offers."
