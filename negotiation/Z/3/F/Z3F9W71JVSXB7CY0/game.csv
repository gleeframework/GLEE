"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,100,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $900,000 as a starting point for negotiations. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is far too low for me. Considering the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while acknowledging my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  I believe it's a fair offer that considers both our needs and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we are nearing a price we can both agree on. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to offer $975,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while respecting your original valuation.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll unfortunately have to sell the product to John.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
