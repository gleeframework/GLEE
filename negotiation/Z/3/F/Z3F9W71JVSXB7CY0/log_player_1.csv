"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $900,000 as a starting point for negotiations. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is far too low for me. Considering the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while acknowledging my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to find a better compromise in the next round.  I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  I believe it's a fair offer that considers both our needs and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round.  However, if we can't come to an agreement in the next round, I'll likely sell to John."
