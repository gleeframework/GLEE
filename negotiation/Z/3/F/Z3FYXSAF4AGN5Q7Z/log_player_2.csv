"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high! It's much more than you're willing to pay and even above her own valuation. You should definitely counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it seems like a great item, $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By starting low, you provide space to increase your offer gradually if needed, while still aiming to stay well below your $100 budget.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful but clearly communicates your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down significantly, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate further and might be able to get closer to your target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price! I appreciate the compromise. While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** You've significantly increased your offer from $80 to $95, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  The counteroffer remains below your $100 limit, ensuring you don't overspend.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This offer will reveal how much further Alice is willing to lower her price and if a mutually agreeable price point is within reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $130. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice increased her offer from $120 to $130. This indicates she's not willing to go below your maximum budget of $100. It's unlikely you'll get a better deal from Alice at this point. You can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John, which is a much better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
