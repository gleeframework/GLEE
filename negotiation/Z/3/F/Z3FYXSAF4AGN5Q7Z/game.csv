Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it seems like a great item, $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price! I appreciate the compromise. While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $130. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth considering.",130.0,Alice,5,
