,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $140?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm thinking of $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $155 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm wondering if we can settle on $145?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. ",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of $152.50. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",152.5,Alice,7,
