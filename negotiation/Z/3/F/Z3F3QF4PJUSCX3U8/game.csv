"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a good return.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. Can we meet in the middle?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $935,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal!",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I need you to come down a bit more. Can we meet at $915,000?",915000.0,Bob,6,
