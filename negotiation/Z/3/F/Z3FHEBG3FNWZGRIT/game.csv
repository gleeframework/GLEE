,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Would you be open to discussing that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Would you consider $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $18000 is still outside of my budget. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $12000. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you can still make a profit. Let's close this deal!",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Would you consider $16000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I remain firm at $12000. This is my final offer, and it's the best price I can afford. Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. I've already compromised significantly. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $2000. This way, you'll still get a great deal. Would you consider $18000 for the product and the service?",18000.0,Alice,7,
