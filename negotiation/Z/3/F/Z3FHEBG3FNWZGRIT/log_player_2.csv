# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Would you consider $16000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,000 is getting closer to his budget, he's still better off sticking to his initial offer.  He has more rounds left to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice will eventually agree to his price. If not, he can always buy from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. I've already compromised significantly. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $2000. This way, you'll still get a great deal. Would you consider $18000 for the product and the service? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice is not willing to budge on her price, and Bob has already made his final offer.  He's only got a few rounds left, and it's unlikely she'll change her mind.  It's better to secure the product at his budget than risk getting stuck with a higher price."
