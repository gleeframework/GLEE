Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Ambitious but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but secures a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Remember, you have John as a backup, giving you leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but above $1,000,000).
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship is important, a less aggressive approach might be beneficial.
