Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $100 as possible since that's my best-case scenario.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer it at a price that's appealing but still profitable. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives me leverage to aim slightly higher with Bob.

By offering the product at $99, I'm giving Bob a small ""discount"" while still securing a significant profit. This strategy aims to make the offer attractive to Bob while capitalizing on my strong position with John as a backup buyer."
