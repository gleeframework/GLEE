Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counter-offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to me, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm willing to take the $920,000 to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
