"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $108.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $108 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $112. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
