"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You're saving $500, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **There's no harm in trying to get a better deal.**  You might be able to get closer to your target price. 
* **You have a backup option.** If the negotiation fails, you can still buy from John. This gives you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to pay $9,000, which would still represent a good profit for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,200, which is still a great deal considering the value it will bring to your life and business. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has come down to $9,200, which is only $200 more than my counteroffer.**  This is a small difference, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John would cost $10,000, so this offer is still a significant savings.**
* **I'm comfortable with this price and can move forward with the purchase.**"
