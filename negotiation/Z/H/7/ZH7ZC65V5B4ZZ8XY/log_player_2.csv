"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $9,000.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above John's price. I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to John's price, but I'm still willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $8,000.  We're running out of rounds, so the next offer will be my last attempt to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $8,200.  If you can't accept this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 8200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is my final offer, aimed at securing a small discount from Alice's last offer. By stating I'll explore other options, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if Alice doesn't budge. This adds weight to my position and increases the chance of a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  I'm willing to go to $8,300 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and this price is a good compromise. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than John's offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
