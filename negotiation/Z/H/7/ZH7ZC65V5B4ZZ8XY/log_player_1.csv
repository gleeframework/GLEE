Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $10,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $9,000.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is getting closer, I'm still not at my desired price point.  I'll see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $8,200.  If you can't accept this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is tempting, I'm still not quite satisfied with the price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can push Bob a little higher. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  I'm willing to go to $8,300 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 8300}
