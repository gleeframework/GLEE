"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more than that.  He should counteroffer to Alice and see if she's willing to come down closer to his ideal price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a good compromise that gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still able to get the product for $8,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more than that.  He should counteroffer Alice again, hoping to bring the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000,  which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $9,000 is a fair offer. I'm willing to make one last concession to see if we can reach a deal. I'll accept $9,500 for the product.  It's a small difference, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer of $9,500 is still higher than what Bob can get from John. While it's closer to his ideal price, it's not worth risking that John might change his mind or the product might be gone by the time Bob negotiates with Alice any further."
