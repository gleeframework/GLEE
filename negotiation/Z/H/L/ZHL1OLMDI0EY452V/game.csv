"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000. This price still leaves a good margin for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
