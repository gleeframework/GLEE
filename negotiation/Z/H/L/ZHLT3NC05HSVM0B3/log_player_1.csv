Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also leaving room for you to benefit greatly."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), she should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying above Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but it's a calculated risk Alice takes to potentially earn an extra $150,000."
