{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below the market value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's higher than the value to Bob:** This ensures that Bob will have an incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer.

By starting with this offer, you are increasing your chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement while also ensuring you get a fair price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my goal of $1,500,000."

Bob's offer:

While $950,000 is closer to my acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still too far away from my desired outcome.  John is offering a much better price and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that's not beneficial to me.  I'm going to sell to John and ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
