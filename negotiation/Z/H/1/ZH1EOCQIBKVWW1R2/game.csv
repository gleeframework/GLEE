"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer, I'm not sure I can go any lower.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation and appreciate your final offer. While I'm willing to meet you halfway again, $9,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $10,000 as a final compromise.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if this is something you can work with. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
