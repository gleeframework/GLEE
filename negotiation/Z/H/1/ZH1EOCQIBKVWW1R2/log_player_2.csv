Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us.
