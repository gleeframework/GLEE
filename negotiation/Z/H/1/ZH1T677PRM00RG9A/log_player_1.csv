"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but also want to avoid immediately alienating him with an overly aggressive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000.  This is still above my minimum price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway.  I believe this is a fair price considering my initial offer, and hopefully, it will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm determined to get at least $10,000 for the product. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with him in hopes of reaching a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000.  This is a compromise that shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with Bob. However, it's still a price I'm comfortable with, as it's above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm satisfied with this outcome.  There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or having Bob walk away.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
