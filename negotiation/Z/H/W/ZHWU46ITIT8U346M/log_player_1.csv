Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I use language like ""Let me know your thoughts"" to show that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation becomes too lengthy or unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I have room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** The fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me strong leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. 
* I'll continue to assess the situation and consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob proves unsuccessful or takes too long."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's finalize this! "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am unable to agree to $1,300,000. I would like to counter with $1,250,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you, while also being within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Opportunity for a final push:**  I have a little more room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as backup:**  The fact that I have John as a buyer gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.
* If Bob rejects, I will accept John's offer and move on."
