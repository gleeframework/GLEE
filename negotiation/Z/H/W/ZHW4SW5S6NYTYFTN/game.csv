"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise.  However, $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500, as that's as far as I can stretch my budget.  Let's try to make this work.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15,500 is as far as you can stretch, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $500. Considering the value this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
