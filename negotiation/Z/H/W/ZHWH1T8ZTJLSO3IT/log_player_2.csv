"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While your product is appealing,  $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is still a fair price considering your own valuation and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain a certain profit margin for this transaction. I am willing to consider $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000. This is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will reject the offer and he'll be forced to buy from John.  It's a good balance between saving money and not risking losing the deal altogether."
