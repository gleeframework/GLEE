"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point. However, the value this product represents to me is quite significant. I could come down to $1,275,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
