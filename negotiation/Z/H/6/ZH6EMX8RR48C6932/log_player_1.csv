Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to move closer to your number to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm confident that this product will be valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. Can you consider that?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob has consistently moved his offer upward and has now reached $900,000. This is a significant amount, and continuing to negotiate risks him walking away. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk getting stuck with no deal at all and having to settle for John's offer."
