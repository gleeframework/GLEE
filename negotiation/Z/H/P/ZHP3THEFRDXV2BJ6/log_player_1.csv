**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer, we're still significantly above his perceived value of $1,000,000.  It's worth pushing him a bit further, but we need to be prepared to walk away soon if he doesn't move closer to $1,300,000."

Bob has met our target price. While we could push for more, it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
