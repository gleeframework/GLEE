"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12000. I think it's a fair offer considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $10500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
