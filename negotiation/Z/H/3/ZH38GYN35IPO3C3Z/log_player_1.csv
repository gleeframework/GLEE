Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell the product for $120, I believe there's still some room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm coming down to $135, a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close enough to my minimum value that it's worth accepting.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing him as a buyer and forcing me to sell to John for $120."
