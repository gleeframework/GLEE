Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move forward, I can offer it for $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,900,000 is still a bit steep, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,000,000 is his absolute maximum.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Bob."
