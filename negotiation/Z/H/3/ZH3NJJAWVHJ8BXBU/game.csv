"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move forward, I can offer it for $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,900,000 is still a bit steep, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
