"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I've done my research and understand its value to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that we're both willing to meet halfway. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
