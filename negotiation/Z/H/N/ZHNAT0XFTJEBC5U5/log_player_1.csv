Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and lower than the product's worth to Bob of $150. This gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn more than selling to John while giving Bob a slightly better deal than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $95 is still significantly more than selling to John. It's a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can make a profit on this sale."
