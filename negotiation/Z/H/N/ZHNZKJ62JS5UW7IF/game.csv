"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm sure we can both find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Alice,5,
