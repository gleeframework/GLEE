Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $10,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. It avoids potential delays and ensures a guaranteed sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. There's a chance he might be willing to go slightly higher, closer to his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The offer isn't exorbitantly high, which might deter Bob. It presents a price point that encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will dictate further negotiation strategy."
