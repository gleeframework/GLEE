Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start high.  A starting price of $1,200,000 leaves significant room for negotiation while aiming for a substantial profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely and doesn't sound like an ultimatum. By asking for Bob's thoughts, we invite him to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.
* **Justification:** While brief, the mention of ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the justification for the high asking price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to reach an agreement with Bob."
