Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $650,000.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this would be a win-win."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's still room to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $725,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $825,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on your end but ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset."",
