Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and my minimum is $8,000, there's room for negotiation. Starting at $10,000 leaves space to potentially negotiate down while still exceeding my minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies a willingness to discuss the price, making Bob feel more comfortable countering.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing out completely."
