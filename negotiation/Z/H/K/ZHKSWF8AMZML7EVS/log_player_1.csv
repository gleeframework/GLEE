Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $12,000 but lower than our guaranteed $15,000.
* **Balance Confidence and Flexibility:** We're confident in the product's value, hence the relatively high offer. However, we're not starting at $15,000 because it might scare Bob away without a counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible sale price while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
