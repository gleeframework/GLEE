"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There are 9 rounds left, and Bob has room to lower the price.  There's no need to rush into a deal yet, especially since John's offer is a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant price drop. This strategy is risky but could pay off if Alice is eager to sell. The offer leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds. This approach aims to establish a lower price range early on, while still keeping the possibility of reaching a deal within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to compromise further. It's important to remember that there are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample time to negotiate.  Buying from John at this point would be less beneficial than continuing to see if a better deal can be reached with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about reaching a deal but isn't willing to give in completely.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.  The goal is to find a point where Alice is motivated to accept, while still keeping the final price within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is only $50,000 away from Bob's previous offer.  There's a good chance that the next few rounds will only involve small adjustments to the price, and it's unlikely that Alice will come down to Bob's desired price.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk missing out on a deal and having to pay John's higher price.  Additionally, with 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to potentially negotiate a further reduction, potentially by offering a smaller discount in exchange for additional perks."
