Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming for the best deal, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer could potentially get you the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,100 for the product.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,100, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I think I can do better than that. Let me think for a moment... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still trying to get the best possible deal and haven't reached your ideal price point. It's likely Alice will come down a bit more, and you can potentially reach an agreement that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,150 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm hoping we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,300. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best deal you can get from Alice, as she has made it clear this is her final offer.  Although you can still try for a lower price in round 10, you risk losing the opportunity to buy from her and having to pay the full price from John."
