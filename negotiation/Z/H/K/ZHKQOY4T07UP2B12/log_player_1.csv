Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100 before I list it publicly. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first allows me to potentially earn a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $100 is:
    *  Higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving me room for negotiation if needed.
    * Low enough to be enticing to Bob, as it represents a significant discount compared to the alternative buyer's offer. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the value to Bob and suggesting a sense of exclusivity by mentioning a public listing."
