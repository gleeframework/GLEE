"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1100000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this some more thought, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This is still below the original asking price, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1075000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1060000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
