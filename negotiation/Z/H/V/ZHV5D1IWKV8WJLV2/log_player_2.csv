"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and acknowledging your need for a fair return. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  There's still room for compromise before Bob needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and still allows Bob to save $200,000 compared to his initial maximum budget.  While Bob might be able to squeeze a little more out with continued negotiation, there's a risk Alice will walk away or reject any further counteroffers.  Accepting the offer secures a good price with minimal risk."
