"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $15500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $13000 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.
