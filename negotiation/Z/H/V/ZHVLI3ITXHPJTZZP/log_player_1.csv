{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $100?  That would be fair to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum,  I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'd rather sell to John and get my target price."
