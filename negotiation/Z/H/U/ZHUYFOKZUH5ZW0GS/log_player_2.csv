# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to go lower than $10,000 and still get a good deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $9,500. This price is still a good deal for me, considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could continue to negotiate,  Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise.  It's still below your maximum price of $8,000 and allows you to avoid the potential risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer or a lengthy negotiation process."
