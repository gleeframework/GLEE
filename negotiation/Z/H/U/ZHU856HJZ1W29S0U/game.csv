"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true value. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this revised offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $800000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase the product from John for that price.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers, including the one from John for $1000000.",825000.0,Alice,5,
