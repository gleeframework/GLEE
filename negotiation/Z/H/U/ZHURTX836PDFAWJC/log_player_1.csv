Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm mindful of John's offer of $1,500,000, so I'm not willing to go below that. 
* **Negotiation:**  This offer allows for back-and-forth negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, and we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for negotiation. He's shown a willingness to pay more than his initial assessment ($1,200,000), indicating he values the product. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob.

**Next Step:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:** My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Reason:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and the fact that this is a significant discount from my initial offer, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  This counteroffer maintains the negotiation process and allows for further back-and-forth to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my offer, I'll finalize the deal. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counteroffer again, or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1300000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price but is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, which means further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he might walk away, and I might have to settle for John's offer, which is slightly less than what I'm currently being offered.

**Conclusion:**  Given that Bob's offer is relatively close to my acceptable range and the potential risk of losing the deal altogether, I believe accepting his offer is the most strategic decision."
