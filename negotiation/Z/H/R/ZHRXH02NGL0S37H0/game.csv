"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
