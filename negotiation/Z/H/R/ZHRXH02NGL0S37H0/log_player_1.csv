Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?
