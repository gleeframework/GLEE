Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

Alice is bluffing. She knows you have a backup option at $8,000, and she's unlikely to risk losing the sale entirely. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John."
