"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value. To be fair to both of us, I could go as low as $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
