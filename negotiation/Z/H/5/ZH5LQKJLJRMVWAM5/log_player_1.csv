I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $82 is a good price, and it's more than what I'd get from John. I'm satisfied with this outcome and don't want to risk losing the deal by counteroffering."
