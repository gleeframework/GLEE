"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This price still gives you a significant margin for value and allows me to secure a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
