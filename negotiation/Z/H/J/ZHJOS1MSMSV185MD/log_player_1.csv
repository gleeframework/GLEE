Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, aiming high initially allows you to potentially capture the majority of the value difference ($2,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price (which still might be more than your alternative with John).
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:** This strategy prioritizes getting a deal done with Bob quickly, as you have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
