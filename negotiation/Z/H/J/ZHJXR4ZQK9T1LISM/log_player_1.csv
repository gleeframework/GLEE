I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can push for a higher amount, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'm a little disappointed I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm confident that selling to John is the best option for me financially.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I don't want to risk losing out on the chance to get my target price."
