"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $17000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $17500. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $17000.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me in the middle, I'd be happy to make the deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,
