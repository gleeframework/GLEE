"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $130 for a product you value at $100. It's better to try negotiating with Alice or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer of $90 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than her asking price but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my limit. I'll continue to negotiate to see if I can get it closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm increasing my offer to $105, which is still less than Alice's offer, but closer to my maximum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to overpay."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still above my price limit, but I'm getting closer. I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering my maximum price of $100. This is a firm offer, and if Alice rejects it, I'll go with John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

```

Alice is not budging from $108. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. It's not the best deal, but it's still within my budget."
