"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a good profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
