"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,200,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
