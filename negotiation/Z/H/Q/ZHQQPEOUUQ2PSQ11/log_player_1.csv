"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low.  I'm confident I can get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,200,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
