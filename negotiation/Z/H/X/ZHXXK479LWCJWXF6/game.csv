"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,250,000 is a fair offer, it's a bit below what I'm hoping to achieve. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
