Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (but not too much):** While Bob might be willing to pay the full $1,500,000, starting with a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quick acceptance.  
* **Strong Position:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and uses a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach, leveraging the knowledge that there's a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while minimizing the risk of him rejecting the offer and forcing a sale to John at a lower price."
