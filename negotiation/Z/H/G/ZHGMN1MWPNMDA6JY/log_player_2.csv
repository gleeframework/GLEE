"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $90. Would you like to make a purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is cheaper than John's offer, you can likely get a better price from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you encourage her to potentially lower the price closer to her $80 value."
