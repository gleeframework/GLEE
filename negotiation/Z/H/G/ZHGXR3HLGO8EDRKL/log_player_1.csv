Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum. Bob is likely to negotiate, and this gives you the option to come down slightly while still making a significant profit.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** While aiming for maximum profit is important, consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is desirable. A slightly lower price might foster goodwill for future interactions. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), adjust your approach accordingly."
