Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9500. I'd like to propose a compromise: how about $8800? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm still hopeful that we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not willing to settle for anything below $9,000.  I'm also considering the value of the product to me and the potential of John offering me a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $8,800 is closer, I'm still unable to go lower than $9,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8900? It's a bit above my initial target, but I'm willing to stretch to get a deal done. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $9,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to get me a higher price.  John is offering a price that is significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity."
