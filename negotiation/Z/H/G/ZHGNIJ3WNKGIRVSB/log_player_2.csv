Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $105?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can do $95, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $95. While closer to my goal, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed $100 offer from John."
