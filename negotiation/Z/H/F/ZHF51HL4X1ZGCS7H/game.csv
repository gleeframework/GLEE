"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to consider a price of $1000000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1100000?  This is a fair price considering the product's unique qualities and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
