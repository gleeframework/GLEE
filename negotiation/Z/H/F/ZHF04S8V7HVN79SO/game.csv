"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product has value, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a significant reduction on my end.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering we've both been willing to compromise. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Bob,6,
