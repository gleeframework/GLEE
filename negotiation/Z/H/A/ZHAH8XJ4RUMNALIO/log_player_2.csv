{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than your $150 limit, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($120) creates room for negotiation. This also shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal.  The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of securing a lower price open."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her price to $110.  This counteroffer of $105 shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price within your budget. It also demonstrates that you are actively trying to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now very close to your desired range.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, and the potential savings are minimal.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price you are comfortable with."
