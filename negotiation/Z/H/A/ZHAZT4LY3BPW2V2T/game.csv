"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $14,000. I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means.",14000.0,Bob,4,
