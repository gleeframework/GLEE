Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,125,000 is just too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly more, to $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,200,000 and you're running out of rounds to negotiate. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
