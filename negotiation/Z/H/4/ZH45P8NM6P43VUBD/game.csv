"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
