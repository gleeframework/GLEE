Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's still significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,100,000, which is a good compromise. It's more than what Bob is willing to pay, but still significantly less than what it's worth to me.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value for Bob while maintaining my own position. I'm also keeping it casual and encouraging a response.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit while still securing a sale.
* Offering $1,100,000 gives Bob a good deal, potentially making him more likely to accept. 
* If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup, ensuring I won't lose out on my desired profit."
