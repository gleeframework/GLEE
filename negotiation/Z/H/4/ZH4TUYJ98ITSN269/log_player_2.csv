"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $100 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget. You can always buy from John later if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This tactic aims to:
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility.
    *  Establish a lower range for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains respectful and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further discussion.
* **Strategic Positioning:** While $60 is far from Alice's desired price, it leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while staying well below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $80 is my absolute minimum. Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product at your target price.  You could try to negotiate further, but there's a chance Alice might not budge and you'd end up buying from John anyway."
