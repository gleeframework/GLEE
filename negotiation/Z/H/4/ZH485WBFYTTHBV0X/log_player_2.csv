"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's  worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if a more acceptable price can be reached."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has immense potential, and I'm confident in its value.  How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There's a chance Bob might be able to secure a better price by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a little higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which reflects its true value and allows us both to have a successful transaction.  I'm ready to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
