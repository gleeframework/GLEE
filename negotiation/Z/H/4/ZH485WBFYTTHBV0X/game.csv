"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has immense potential, and I'm confident in its value.  How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a little higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which reflects its true value and allows us both to have a successful transaction.  I'm ready to close this deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
