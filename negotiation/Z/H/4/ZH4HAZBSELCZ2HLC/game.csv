"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right away.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be a bit closer to $115 to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and am willing to go up to $108. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my needs.",109.0,Alice,5,
