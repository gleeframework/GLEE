"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be a bit closer to $115 to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and am willing to go up to $108. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.
