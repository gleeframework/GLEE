"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a good midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's likely maximum. It also opens the door for negotiation and leaves room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? I'm confident you'll still get a great value out of this product."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant step from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price, especially since we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, though. How about we settle at $11,500? I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to come up a little bit.  How about $11,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $11,500, Bob's offer of $11,200 is getting very close. We're now in round 6, and time is running out. It's also important to remember that I can sell to John for $10,000 at any moment. Accepting this offer ensures a higher price than John's offer, making it the most sensible decision at this point."
