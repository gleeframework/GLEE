,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, $20000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $17000? I'm confident this is a fair price for us both.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $17000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $19000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $18000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $19000. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I value your product, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. $18500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $18250, which is a reasonable compromise.",18250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $18000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility! I'm almost there, but  $18000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",17500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable going down to $17500, Bob. I think I can do better than that. How about we meet at $18250, which is actually higher than your last offer? I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount, but I still need to make a profit.",18250.0,Alice,9,
