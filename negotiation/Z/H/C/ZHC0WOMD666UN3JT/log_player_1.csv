Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that amount.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to increase his bid in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's try to bridge the gap and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer, $10,750 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you're trying to meet me in the middle.  Unfortunately, $10,750 is still not enough for me to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a fair price given the product's value.  Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
