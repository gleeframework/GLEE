{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are still leaving yourself room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand what you're proposing.

By starting with this offer, you are setting the stage for a successful negotiation. You can adjust your strategy depending on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, you can consider lowering your price slightly, but be careful not to go too low. If he accepts, you have secured a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $850,000?  This price still leaves you a good margin for profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better offer from him.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $1,000,000, this is a good deal for me."
