Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, which might make Bob more willing to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  $175 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  It's not worth it to sell at that price. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to keep the conversation open and encouraging.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm trying to find a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to you, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could we settle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. I'm hoping to get a little closer to my goal of $150. I will reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is still above my minimum but demonstrates my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a significant compromise to emphasize my willingness to negotiate.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
