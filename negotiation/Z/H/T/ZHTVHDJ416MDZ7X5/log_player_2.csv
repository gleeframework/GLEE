It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first, as you can potentially get the product for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $85? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer of $87.50 is within your budget and still saves you some money compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise."
