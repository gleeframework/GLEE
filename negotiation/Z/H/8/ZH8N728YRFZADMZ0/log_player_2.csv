"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product ($10,000).  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to go with John, who will sell the product for Bob's maximum value."
