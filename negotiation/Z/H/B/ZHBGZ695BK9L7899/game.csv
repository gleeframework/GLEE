"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, and I am serious about purchasing it. To demonstrate that, I'm increasing my offer to $700,000. This is a substantial jump and reflects my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point. However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge. To show I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, I'll come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the current price point is still not feasible for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I need to see significant movement towards my budget, otherwise, I'll need to consider other options for this purchase.",750000.0,Bob,6,
