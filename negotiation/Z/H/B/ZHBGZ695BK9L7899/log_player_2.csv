"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating often involves starting with a lower offer than your actual target. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to feel like she's getting a better deal in the end.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **Justification:** While a simple ""too high"" is valid, briefly explaining the counteroffer shows seriousness and a desire to find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice dropped her price, but it's still significantly higher than our target and John's offer.  We need to show we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.  It's time to increase our offer, but still stay well below her current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, and I am serious about purchasing it. To demonstrate that, I'm increasing my offer to $700,000. This is a substantial jump and reflects my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  Jumping to $700,000 shows Alice we're serious but also establishes a firm upper limit close to John's offer.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:**  The wording aims to shift the tone from a back-and-forth to finding a solution that works for both parties. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're now close to our walk-away point.  This puts pressure on Alice, as further counteroffers from her risk pushing us towards John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point. However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge. To show I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, I'll come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's price drops are becoming smaller, and we're still significantly above our target. 
* **John's Offer:** The constant availability of John's offer at $800,000 gives us leverage.
* **Time Pressure:**  We need to signal that Alice's concessions aren't moving us fast enough.  Another rejection might make her more amenable to a larger drop in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the current price point is still not feasible for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I need to see significant movement towards my budget, otherwise, I'll need to consider other options for this purchase."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This firmly communicates that our patience is limited. 
* **Small Increase:** A minor bump to $750,000 shows flexibility but also emphasizes that we're nearing our walk-away point.
* **Alternative Mention:**   By mentioning ""other options,"" we subtly remind Alice about John's offer without directly referencing it, adding pressure.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, this creates urgency for Alice to either accept or make a substantial counteroffer."
