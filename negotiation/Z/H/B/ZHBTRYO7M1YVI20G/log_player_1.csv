"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but I want to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest by asking for his opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is worth less than $90 to me. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $80 for the product. This aligns closely with what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 aligns with my minimum acceptable price and is the same as what John is offering.  Therefore, it makes sense to accept his offer."
