"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value in your product, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
