Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000,  selling to Bob at a higher price yields greater profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it slightly above that entices him while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly before losing the opportunity."
