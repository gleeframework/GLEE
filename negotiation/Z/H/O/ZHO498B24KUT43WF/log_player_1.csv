Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust your price slightly downward while still aiming to stay above your $10,000 minimum."
