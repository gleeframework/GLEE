"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $10000 for this item. Would you be able to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
