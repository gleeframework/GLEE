"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in paying $110 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer. This might encourage her to come back with a lower price closer to her $80 valuation.  If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
