"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
