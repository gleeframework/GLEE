"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting close.  How about we settle at $800,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
