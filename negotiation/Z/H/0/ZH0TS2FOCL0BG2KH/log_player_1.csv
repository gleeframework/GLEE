Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and appealing to Bob's interests. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting high, I have room to negotiate down if necessary. However, if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer, it's significantly lower than my starting point. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm not able to go that low.  $1,100,000 is the lowest I can go, considering the value of this product. I believe this still represents a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I've maintained a friendly and professional tone while stating my firm stance. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise that's beneficial for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1075000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price.  While $1,075,000 is slightly less than my initial hope, it is significantly higher than John's offer.  At this point, it's more beneficial to close the deal with Bob and secure a profit. There's always a chance he could lower his offer further in the next round, but accepting this offer ensures a relatively strong return and finalizes the sale."
