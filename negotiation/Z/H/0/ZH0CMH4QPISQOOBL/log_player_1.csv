"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and above Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Setting the Stage:** This first offer establishes the negotiation range and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Compromise:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room for me to get a better price. 
* **Seeking Higher Value:** Selling to John for $100 is an option, but I'm still aiming for a higher price if possible.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate and maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to emphasize its value.
* **Urgency:** ""Let's close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($100) but willing to concede slightly to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $100, but it's still below my desired price. 
* **Seeking Higher Value:** I'm still aiming for a higher price if possible. Selling to John for $100 is still a viable option. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating position. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm again showing a willingness to compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that $90 is a good deal for both of us, making it more appealing. 
* **Fairness:**  ""Split the difference"" is a common negotiation tactic to reach a mutually acceptable price.

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to Bob while still earning a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $100. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet willing to accept a price that leaves me with less than my minimum.
* **Seeking Higher Value:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $90 before accepting.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to see if he's willing to budge further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $89.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This is my final concession before I consider selling to John. I'm offering a price that's just below my target of $90. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value again, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  The message creates a sense of urgency, suggesting that this is a good opportunity for Bob to secure the product.

I'm hoping Bob sees the value in this final offer and closes the deal. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about we try $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $86 is below my minimum price of $100. 
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a failed deal.

I've reached a point where the potential risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
