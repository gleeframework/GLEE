"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $60. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's opening offer is significantly lower than her stated value for the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. While $60 is a good price, I might be able to get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product looks great, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to consider $40?"",
""product_price"": 40
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a low counter-offer of $40 aims to gauge Alice's flexibility. While it's a significant drop from her offer, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation and avoids offending Alice. 
* **Budget Justification:**  Mentioning a ""tight budget"" subtly reinforces the desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $40. How about we meet in the middle at $55? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway from her initial offer. However, the gap between her current offer ($55) and my desired price (around $40) is still significant. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $50 is really the highest I can go right now.  How does that sound?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer ($55) and my previous counter-offer ($40), with a slight edge in her favor. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating ""$50 is really the highest I can go,"" I'm setting a subtle but firm boundary.  It suggests that I'm reaching my limit but still interested in the deal.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The phrase ""How does that sound?"" aims for a collaborative tone, suggesting I'm looking for a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $50. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we try $58? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $58. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $58
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice's offer of $58 is only $8 above my target. Further haggling might yield minimal gains while risking the deal altogether. 
* **Time Investment:** We're halfway through the rounds. Continuing to negotiate takes time, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge much further. 
* **Acceptable Price:**  $58 is a reasonable price for a product valued at $80, especially considering I'm getting a discount."
