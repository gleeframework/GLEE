"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $40. How about we meet in the middle at $55? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",55.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $50. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we try $58? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",58.0,Alice,5,
