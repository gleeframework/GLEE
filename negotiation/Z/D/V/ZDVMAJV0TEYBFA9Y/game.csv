"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This price still gives you a considerable advantage, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm confident that this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is my final offer.  This price still provides you with a substantial savings compared to the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
