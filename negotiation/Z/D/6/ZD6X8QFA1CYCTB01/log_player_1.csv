Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price enticing enough for Bob to accept, maximizing your profit while ensuring you don't go below your minimum. 

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition,"" framing the product positively.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 sits comfortably within the negotiation zone. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value while still being below your guaranteed price from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. You can adjust the price and messaging based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your own risk tolerance."
