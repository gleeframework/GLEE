{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and allows for a possible counteroffer.
* **Message:** The message is polite and sets a positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for a response. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  This price is likely to trigger a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and still have the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  Here's why:

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation. This suggests further negotiation is possible.
* **Seeking a better deal:** I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, especially since I have John as a backup option.

**Next steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim for a price that's still enticing to Bob but keeps me closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's true value and offers you a great opportunity. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,350,000:** This price is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. It signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value. 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer, emphasizes the value of the product, and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding common ground:** By coming down slightly, I show I'm flexible, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** The price remains above Bob's initial offer, reminding him of the potential gains from acquiring the product. 
* **Staying within my bounds:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, but I must stick to my budget. I am now willing to offer $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, I'm choosing to sell to John for the following reasons:

* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob will take more time and effort, which I'd rather avoid. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of Bob further lowering his offer.
* **No Counteroffer:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll counter again. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I secure a quick and profitable sale, ensuring I don't need to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price. While I'm slightly disappointed in not achieving the full $1,500,000, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob."
