I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push Bob higher."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher or, if I can't, at least get him to $1,500,000."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers have consistently been below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk a lower price with Bob."
