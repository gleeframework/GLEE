"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe is worth a significant investment.  I'm asking $15000 for it, but I'm confident it's a price you'll find fair considering its potential value.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and John is already offering the product at that price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John to guarantee getting the product within his budget."
