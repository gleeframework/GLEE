Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle on a price significantly higher than your fallback option of $800,000 from John. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically (""someone with your expertise"") adds weight to the price and might make him more receptive."
