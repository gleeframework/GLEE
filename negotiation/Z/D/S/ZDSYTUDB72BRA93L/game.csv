"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my value for the product. Let's make this deal work.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 still doesn't work for me. We're getting close, but I need to be closer to $1,125,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,112,500.  Let's find a common ground and finalize this deal.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
