``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point - it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
