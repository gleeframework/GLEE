"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe could be of immense value to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1200000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I believe the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
