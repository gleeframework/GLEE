I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly less than my minimum selling price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay this price as it's still lower than the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this price is still fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500.  Since selling to John will give me a better price, I'll choose to sell the product to him."
