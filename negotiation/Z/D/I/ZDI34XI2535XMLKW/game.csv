"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial price is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $850,000, which is still significantly less than your initial price, but represents a fair value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's unique nature and potential for substantial return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which represents a significant jump from my previous offer and a compromise on both sides. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while staying within my financial limitations. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find middle ground.  Let's make this simple: I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a final offer, reflecting my best judgment of its value while acknowledging your interest. It's a deal that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  This would be a fair deal that allows us both to achieve our objectives.  I hope we can find a way to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
