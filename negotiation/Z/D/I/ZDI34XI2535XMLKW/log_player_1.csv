"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** In negotiations, it's generally advisable to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you set a high anchor, making subsequent offers around $1,000,000 seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  You have 10 rounds and the option to walk away to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.  This strategy allows for concessions while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial price is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $850,000, which is still significantly less than your initial price, but represents a fair value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's a step in the right direction, you have room to negotiate. You have the security of John's offer and plenty of rounds left to try to bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's unique nature and potential for substantial return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You are making a significant concession from your initial offer, signaling to Bob that you are serious about finding a deal.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While the new offer is lower, it's still substantially above Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** You are reiterating the value proposition to keep Bob engaged and potentially willing to move closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which represents a significant jump from my previous offer and a compromise on both sides. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while staying within my financial limitations.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to your $1,000,000 minimum, but you're not there yet. You're still in a strong negotiating position with John's offer as a safety net. It's worth seeing if you can get Bob closer to your target in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find middle ground.  Let's make this simple: I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a final offer, reflecting my best judgment of its value while acknowledging your interest. It's a deal that benefits both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer makes it clear that you're getting close to your bottom line while still leaving some room for negotiation if Bob is truly motivated.
* **Simplified Terms:**  Presenting a ""final offer"" can add weight to your position and encourage Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By coming down to $1,100,000, you're still significantly above Bob's offer but also making a clear concession that might entice him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  This would be a fair deal that allows us both to achieve our objectives.  I hope we can find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut your losses.  Bob's latest offer still falls short of your $1,000,000 minimum. His incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to meet your valuation in the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it's the most logical decision to maximize your profit."
