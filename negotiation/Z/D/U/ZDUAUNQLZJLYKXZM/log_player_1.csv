"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum valuation.  It's important to set a strong starting point to establish my desired value and leave room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to Bob, highlighting the potential benefits for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target, so I'll reject his offer and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is still above Bob's offer but a significant concession from my initial price. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a price that remains closer to my minimum. I'm also highlighting the mutual benefits of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get a better offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would ensure you get a product that's worth its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm proposing $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a middle ground between our last offers.  I'm framing it as a win-win scenario to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. Is this a price you're comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and the negotiations are getting tedious.  While $975,000 is close, it's still below my threshold. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum and a guaranteed deal."
