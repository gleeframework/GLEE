Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price:**  $1,200,000 is a good chunk more than the $800,000 I would get from John. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he might be willing to pay more than my offer. This gives us both some room to negotiate.
* **It's likely to be accepted:** It's a fair price for Bob, considering the value he places on the product. It's highly probable he'll accept this offer rather than risk losing out on the product.

By offering this price, I increase my chances of earning a higher profit while also keeping the possibility of a successful negotiation open."
