"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I'm happy to work with you. However, I need to make a profit, and $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12500.0,Alice,5,
