"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. While I can't disclose the specific details just yet, I can assure you it's worth no less than $800000 to me. I believe you'd find it highly beneficial, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $500,000 less than John's price. 
* **You don't know the true value:** While Alice claims the product is worth at least $800,000 to her, you don't know the true value.  It could be worth more to her, and she might be willing to accept a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Alice's offer gives you a chance to potentially save $500,000.  Rejecting it guarantees you'll pay the higher price to John. 

**It's better to take the risk and accept Alice's offer.**"
