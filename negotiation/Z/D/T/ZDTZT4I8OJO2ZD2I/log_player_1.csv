Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much more. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the value of the product and presents the price as a ""steal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiating but also sets the initial terms.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiating range. I'm willing to go lower, but I won't accept anything below $1,000,000 (John's offer), as that's my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to reach a price closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. I will aim for a price closer to my initial offer while also acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher to reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:** The message highlights the willingness to compromise while emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $875,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, which shows a genuine effort to reach a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and open tone, encouraging Bob to consider the counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's willingness to pay. It's likely Bob will be more receptive to this offer, as it shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is significantly below my desired price and getting increasingly close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of lowering the price even further, potentially jeopardizing my profit.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and also a higher price than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to negotiate a higher price with Bob, the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price is too high. Selling to John ensures a secure and profitable outcome."
