Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for some potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, ensuring you don't make a loss. 

This strategy aims for the highest potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
