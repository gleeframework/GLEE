{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and makes the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **It's higher than the product's worth to Bob:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **It shows you're serious about selling to Bob:**  By starting with a concrete offer, you demonstrate your willingness to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses. If he rejects, you can lower your offer slightly, but be careful not to drop below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  You also have the option of switching to John if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired range.  It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price that's more in line with your goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but also that you value the product.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  Bob may still want a lower price, so there's room to compromise again.
* **Is still above your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're not losing out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering your original asking price and my ability to secure the product elsewhere.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below what you ideally want. There's potential to push for a higher price, and it's worth exploring a counteroffer. You can try to meet halfway and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

```

This counteroffer:

* **Offers a compromise:** It shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Is still above your minimum acceptable price:**  You're not giving up too much profit.
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  It highlights the value of the product and your concessions, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my ability to purchase it elsewhere for $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiations have reached a stalemate. While $975,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you're aiming for. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to go much higher, and continuing to negotiate risks wasting time and potentially losing a better deal with John. Selling the product to John guarantees you your desired minimum price of $1,500,000, making it the most financially advantageous option."
