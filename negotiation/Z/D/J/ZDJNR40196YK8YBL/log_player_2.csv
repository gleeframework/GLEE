"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000, a price that reflects its true value to you. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she states the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, this doesn't change the fact that her asking price is higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
