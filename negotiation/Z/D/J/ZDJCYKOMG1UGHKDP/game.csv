"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $1,075,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product is worth it for me.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
