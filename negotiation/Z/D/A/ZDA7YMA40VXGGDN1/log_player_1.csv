"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me immediately feeling like I'm losing too much.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also considering the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work towards a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to propose $9,500 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve:**  I'm still early in the negotiation process and have 8 rounds left.  By rejecting, I can continue to explore better deals. 
* **Potential for counteroffers:** Rejecting gives me the opportunity to send a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that's more favorable for me.

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's try $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and we can both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding a significant margin.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and reinforcing the mutual benefits of a deal.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  $11,000 still leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's been forced into a corner. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation process, slowly bridging the gap between my desired price and Bob's perceived value, while also keeping the possibility of selling to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you can consider this and let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,500 remains well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I have leverage:** I have 6 rounds left and the possibility of selling to John for my desired price. This gives me leverage to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is firm on his offer, there's still a possibility he might be willing to budge if I remain persistent.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500.  It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a good compromise, allowing us both to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Highlighting mutual benefits:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that a compromise would benefit both of us.
* **Remaining firm on my minimum:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

**Strategy:**  I'm trying to reach a compromise with Bob while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to consider selling to John in the next round as I'm nearing the end of the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to propose $10,000 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. I look forward to your feedback. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer, but still not enough:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly below my desired value.
* **I have leverage remaining:** With 4 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $15,000, I have leverage to continue pushing for a better price. 
* **Potential for further compromise:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering the value of the product to him.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a deal that's more profitable for me.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will likely consider selling to John in the next round to ensure I don't lose out on a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  However,  $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make a deal.  This would be a good compromise, allowing us both to walk away happy with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but showing flexibility:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further by moving slightly closer to his proposed price.
* **Reiterating the value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him and highlighting that a deal at $11,000 would still be beneficial for him.
* **Setting a clear deadline:** I'm subtly implying that if Bob rejects this offer, I'm more likely to sell to John in the next round.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible while recognizing the need for compromise. If Bob still refuses, I'll have to weigh the possibility of accepting his offer versus selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with $10,500 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the item while also being fair to both parties involved. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to the final two rounds, and there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $10,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price or a failed deal.

**Strategy:** With the clock ticking and Bob's offer still below my minimum, it's more prudent to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John.  This ensures that I receive my desired value for the product without the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
