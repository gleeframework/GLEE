"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:** I'm aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can lower my price in subsequent rounds. 
* **It's above my minimum:** I'm still comfortable with this price as it's higher than my minimum of $1,200,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I will reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still allows for a decent profit. It's also closer to my minimum, which might make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not the highest price, it's a good compromise. I'm getting a higher price than John would offer, and we're only in round 4.  It's worth securing the sale now to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
