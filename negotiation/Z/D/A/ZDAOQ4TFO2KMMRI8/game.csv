"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $975000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1025000. This is as close as I can get to my target price without compromising too much. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but I'd like to discuss some additional value that you can provide. Could you consider throwing in a free warranty or a discount on future purchases?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your request, Bob, and I'm willing to consider adding some value to the deal. However, I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin too much. I can offer a 5% discount on future purchases, which I think is a fair compromise. As for the product price, I'm willing to meet you at $990000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to add value to the deal, but I'm not convinced that a 5% discount on future purchases is enough. I'd like to propose an alternative: a 10% discount on the initial purchase price. If you're willing to do that, I'd be willing to meet you at $990000. What do you think?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to give away too much profit. I can offer a 7.5% discount on the initial purchase price, which is a compromise between my target price and your request. As for the product price, I'm willing to meet you at $990000. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm at my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but no lower. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to walk away from the deal and buy the product from John for $1000000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,10,
