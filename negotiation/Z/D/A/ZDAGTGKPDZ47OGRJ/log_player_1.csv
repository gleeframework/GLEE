{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes the potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to go below this price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $11,500 offer is a strong starting point, encouraging Bob to consider the deal seriously."
