"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's always a good strategy to start by rejecting an initial offer that is too high, especially when you have the option to buy from another seller.  Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price. This establishes his budget and sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (""out of my budget""), which is polite and avoids appearing overly aggressive.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $12,000 is still a good distance from Bob's maximum budget, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product to you for $17000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price.  The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate suggests that further concessions might be possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:** Bob continues to negotiate with small increments, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.
* **Positivity and Collaboration:**  The message emphasizes a desire to find a solution that works for both parties, fostering a more collaborative tone. 
* **Remaining Room:**  $14,000 still leaves some room for negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially close the deal without exceeding his budget."
