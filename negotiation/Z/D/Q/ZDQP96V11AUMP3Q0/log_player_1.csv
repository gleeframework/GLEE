Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to get as close to $19,000 as possible. Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John if Bob declines. This gives you leverage to aim high with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception of Value:**  While you know his base valuation, Bob might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives additional value that you haven't highlighted. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate.  You might need to adjust your price slightly downward, but always aim to stay above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000)."
