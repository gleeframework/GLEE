"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to still make a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $90 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
