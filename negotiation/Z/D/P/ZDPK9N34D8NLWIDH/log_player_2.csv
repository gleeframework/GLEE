"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you, which holds significant value at $10,000 to you. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $9,500. This opportunity is exclusive and designed to ensure you receive the best value while allowing me to maximize the return on my investment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a counter-offer, potentially getting you a price closer to $8,000. Even if she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
