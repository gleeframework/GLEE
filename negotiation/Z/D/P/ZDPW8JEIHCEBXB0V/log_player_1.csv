Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob interested:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in.  To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. Offering it at $1,400,000 gives him a $100,000 incentive to buy from you. 
* **Maximizing Your Profit:** This price is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), ensuring a healthy profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the slight buffer below Bob's maximum valuation allows for some negotiation if he counters.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to give yourself bargaining room.
* **Market Factors:**  Are there other potential buyers similar to Bob? If the market is hot, you could consider a slightly more aggressive price. 

This offer strikes a good balance between attracting Bob and securing a great deal for yourself."
