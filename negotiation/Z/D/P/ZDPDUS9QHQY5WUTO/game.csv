"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but that price is outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a compromise at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value this product will bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit out of my comfort zone at $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm eager to get this product. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is as close to your offer as I can get, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
