Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us a range to work with.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible without pushing Bob away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives us leverage and a fallback option if Bob rejects the offer."
