Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is still a good profit and ensures a sale. Further negotiation might not be fruitful, and I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely or having to settle for John's lower offer."
