"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a starting price of $9,500. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $9,000. This reflects a compromise between my initial asking price and your counteroffer. I hope this proposal will be agreeable to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Based on our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at a price of $8,900. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both the value of the product to you and my original asking price. I hope this proposal will meet your expectations.",8900.0,Alice,5,
