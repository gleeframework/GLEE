Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $127.50? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 127.50}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $127.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Please consider this as my final offer.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. Continuing the negotiation has a high risk of ending with a lower sale price than what John is already offering."
