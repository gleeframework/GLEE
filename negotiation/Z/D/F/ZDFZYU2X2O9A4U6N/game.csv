"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is quite low for the value of this item.  Could you do $150?  That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and a fair compromise.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your current one. How about $105? That's the best I can do at this point.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I want to find a price that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $105.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $127.50? That's my final offer.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $127.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Please consider this as my final offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
