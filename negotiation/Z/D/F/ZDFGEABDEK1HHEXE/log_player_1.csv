Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment that will yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product has a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), Alice can afford to start negotiations high.  A starting price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential to benefit from it, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" the message creates a sense of scarcity and desirability. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point for negotiation.  Alice should be prepared to potentially lower the price during the negotiation process if Bob shows resistance. However, she should aim to secure as much of the potential profit above $1,000,000 as possible."
