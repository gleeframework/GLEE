"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $112.50.  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm still a bit far from your last offer, but I think it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
