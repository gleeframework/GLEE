"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is simply out of my budget. Considering my maximum spending limit and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential it holds for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 remains too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,200,000. This reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be candid, I need to see a significant jump to make this work on my end. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and minimizes my risk in letting it go for less than my ideal price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
