Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is simply out of my budget. Considering my maximum spending limit and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential it holds for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

While $1,800,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 remains too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,200,000. This reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be candid, I need to see a significant jump to make this work on my end. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and minimizes my risk in letting it go for less than my ideal price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.
