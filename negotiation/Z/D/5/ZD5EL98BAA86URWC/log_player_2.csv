"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's definitely closer to what I was hoping for.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000, and significantly lower than buying from John.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving him with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, moving from $10,000 to $9,500.  Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise."
