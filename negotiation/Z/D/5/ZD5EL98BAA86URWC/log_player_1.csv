Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for counteroffers, showing I'm willing to work with him. 

This approach balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open and ensuring Bob doesn't immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a good price for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $12,000, so I can likely get closer to that price. 
* **Avoiding settling too early:**  Selling to John now would guarantee $8,000, but I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's definitely closer to what I was hoping for.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrates that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Emphasize value for Bob:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, hoping to incentivize him to pay a bit more.
* **""Meet me halfway"" language:** This language suggests a sense of fairness and collaboration, making the counteroffer more appealing. 

By taking this approach, I'm aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
