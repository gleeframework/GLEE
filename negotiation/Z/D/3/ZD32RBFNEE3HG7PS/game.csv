"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the current market value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This reflects the product's potential and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's compromise at $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
