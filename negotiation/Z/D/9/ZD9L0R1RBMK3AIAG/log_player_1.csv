Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but still leaves room for potential compromise. It gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations while also leaving some space for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than my desired price. I believe there is room for further negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it is closer to my minimum acceptable price and a further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. It's important to balance potential gains with the risk of losing the deal entirely. Selling to John would mean a lower profit, and the risk of another buyer appearing with a better offer is uncertain. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice in this scenario."
