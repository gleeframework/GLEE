"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your life.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit out of my budget. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to your life.",8500.0,Alice,5,
