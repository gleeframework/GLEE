Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000.  Let's aim for a price closer to my original offer. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm offering the product to you for $885,000.
