"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I value highly. Given its unique features, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the value it brings. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
