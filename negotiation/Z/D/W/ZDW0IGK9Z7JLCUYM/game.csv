"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,000? That would work much better for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you exactly at $10,250. I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $10,400. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10400.0,Alice,7,
