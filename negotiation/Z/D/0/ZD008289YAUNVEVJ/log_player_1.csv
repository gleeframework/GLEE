"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $1,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me.  I could potentially do $725,000.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly under our minimum acceptable price. We're willing to negotiate, but we have a strong alternative with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $762,500?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $745,000?  I feel like that's a fair compromise, and it would help me finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $745,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $745,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are now only $55,000 away from our ideal price and Bob is moving much smaller increments. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $800,000.  We still have John as a reliable backup if Bob won't budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're really close.  I can tell you're serious about this. How about we split the difference and settle at $773,750? It's a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final exchange - $750,000.  It's a fair deal at this point, and I'm ready to close if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is signaling this is his final offer, and we're unlikely to close the $25,000 gap in the remaining rounds. While we could try to squeeze a bit more, it's risky. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is a better outcome than potentially ending up with nothing if Bob walks away."
