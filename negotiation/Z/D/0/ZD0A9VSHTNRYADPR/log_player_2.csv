"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and Alice is offering the product for $120, there's no point in negotiating. You might as well buy it from John directly as you are guaranteed to get the product at your desired price."
