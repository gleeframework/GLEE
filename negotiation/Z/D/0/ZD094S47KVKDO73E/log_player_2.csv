"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. Alice is motivated to sell the product, and you have the advantage of being able to walk away and buy from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary.  By offering $900,000, I'm also leaving room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe I can potentially get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  By rejecting this offer, I can explore further concessions from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  By offering $925,000, I'm trying to find a middle ground between Alice's offer and my previous counteroffer, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is close to my preferred price, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice will become less willing to compromise as we reach the later rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price that's better than what John offers, and it saves me further rounds of negotiation."
