"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
