"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is now within your budget, and it's a decent compromise.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
