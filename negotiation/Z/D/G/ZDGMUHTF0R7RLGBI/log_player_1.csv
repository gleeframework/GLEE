Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair offer considering its potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000) as possible while still securing a profit. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives us a strong fallback position.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with a higher price ($950,000) leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle for a price higher than John's offer.

This strategy aims to balance a high potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
