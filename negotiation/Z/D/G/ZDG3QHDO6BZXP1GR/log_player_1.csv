"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,000,000. This leaves a decent profit margin for me while still being significantly less than the product's value to Bob. I'm aiming to secure a good price quickly while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is clearly interested, so I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but it's still closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject and try to push for $950,000 in the next round.  It's getting late in the game, but I'm not ready to settle for $925,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is Bob's previous offer, and I think it's a fair price given how many rounds have passed.  I'm hopeful he'll accept it and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of time, I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is only $20,000 lower than my previous offer. I'm going to counter again and try to reach a compromise.  We're getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm countering with $935,000.  This is a slight concession from my last offer, but it's still above Bob's latest price point. I'm hoping to show I'm willing to compromise while staying within my desired range. This round is crucial as we are nearing the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob and I are not going to come to an agreement. We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and we're both dug in. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my desired amount. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
