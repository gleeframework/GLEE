Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he wishes, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:**  Acknowledging that the product is valuable to Bob can make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines."
