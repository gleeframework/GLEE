"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11500? This would still be a good value for you considering the product is worth $12000 to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $11500. How about we try $10800? That's as high as I'm willing to go for now.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $11200, so how about $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
