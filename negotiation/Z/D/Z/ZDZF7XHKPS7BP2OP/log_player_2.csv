"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85. That's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're still aiming for a better deal. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

We're getting closer to a deal! This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and our previous one, aiming for a mutually agreeable price."
