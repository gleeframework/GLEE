"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is halfway between Alice's offer of $14,000 and his maximum price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price, so he should reject the offer and continue negotiating.  There's a chance to get a better price, and buying from John is still an option if a deal can't be reached with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying within his maximum budget. This shows that he is willing to compromise, while also pushing for a price closer to his goal. The offer is also a midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, indicating a willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price. While there's a chance Alice might lower her price further, it's also possible that the negotiation will go on for several more rounds without a successful outcome.  Since Bob can buy the product from John at the same price, it's more efficient to end the negotiation and buy from John. This saves time and ensures he gets the product."
