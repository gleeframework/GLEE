"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $14,500 is better than his initial offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $15,000.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial asking price.  How about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $17,000 to $16,000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $16,000 to $14,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

Bob has offered the exact price I'm willing to sell to John for.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer."
