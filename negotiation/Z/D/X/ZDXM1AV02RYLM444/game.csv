"I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial asking price.  How about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can find common ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $17,000 to $16,000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $16,000 to $14,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
