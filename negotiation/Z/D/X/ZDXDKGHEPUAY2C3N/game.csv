"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85? I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $98, which is a bit higher than your offer but still a good compromise. I think this price is reasonable considering the value of the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
