Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $120, making it a reasonable starting point.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This approach balances my desire to get a good price with the possibility of reaching a deal quickly. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, potentially closer to my initial $100 asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $92.50, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for potential negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, thanking Bob for his interest and highlighting the fairness of my counteroffer. This helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to continue.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** $92.50 is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Show flexibility:** Meeting in the middle demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a positive atmosphere:** A friendly message helps keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $88 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer still yields a decent profit. Continuing the negotiation risks losing the sale altogether, as Bob might walk away or John might change his mind about buying. 

Therefore, it's more strategic to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
