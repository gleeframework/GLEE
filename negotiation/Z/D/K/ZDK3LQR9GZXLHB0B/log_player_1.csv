Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Risk assessment:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, I'm comfortable with that risk, knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John.
* **Value unknown:**  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming high, hoping he sees value in the product exceeding $1,500,000.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the potential for rejection."
