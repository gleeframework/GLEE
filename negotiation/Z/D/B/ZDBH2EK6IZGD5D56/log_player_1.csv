"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **John as a Backstop:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm not pressured to make a significant concession early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is my ideal outcome, I still have time to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about achieving a higher price, which might encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from the previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value he would be getting.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm explicitly stating my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution, creating a more collaborative tone.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not making a huge concession, demonstrating that I'm still serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough for me to accept at this point.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have John's offer as a fallback option.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,375,000. This is a compromise that gets us closer to a deal. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing my price only slightly, demonstrating flexibility but not conceding too much.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm still using the ""fair price"" language to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Reaching a Deal:** I'm signaling that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start considering whether John's offer is more appealing than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's my final offer. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are at Round 6, with only 4 rounds left. 
* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  His offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a real risk that we'll reach a stalemate, and I'll end up with nothing.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer is guaranteed, and it meets my minimum requirement.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Selling to John now ensures that I achieve my minimum profit goal.

While I would like to get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high. Selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point, guaranteeing me a good return."
