"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a little ways off from that price point. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,5,
