"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $150, which is the price I can get it for elsewhere. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with the other seller.",150.0,Bob,4,
