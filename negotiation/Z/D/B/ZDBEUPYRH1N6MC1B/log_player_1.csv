Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
