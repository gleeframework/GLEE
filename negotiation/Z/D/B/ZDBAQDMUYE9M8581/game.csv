"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, while I appreciate you moving a little,  $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is closer, but I still can't justify that price.  How about we split the difference and do $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite willing to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to compromise at $16,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",16000.0,Alice,7,
