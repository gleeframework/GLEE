"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product, I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than the $12,000 he'd pay John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price."
