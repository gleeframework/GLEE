"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a slightly higher price that reflects the value this product brings to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
