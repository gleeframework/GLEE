Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good price. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob and increases the chances of him accepting. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's response, keeping in mind your minimum of $800,000 and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your target price.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to push for a higher price. You're still in a good position, as Bob has expressed interest and is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would ensure a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $950,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is close to your desired price and significantly better than selling to John. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for you while also finalizing the sale."
