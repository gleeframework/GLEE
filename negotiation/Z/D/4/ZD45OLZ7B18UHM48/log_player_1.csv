"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the product's true worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is a price I believe is fair, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We're still a good bit away from John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit harder to see how much he's really willing to pay."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but this is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and understand your need to get a fair price. While $1,275,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and hopefully is a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

While we could push Bob a little further, accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is the best move at this point.  This secures a profit beyond John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
