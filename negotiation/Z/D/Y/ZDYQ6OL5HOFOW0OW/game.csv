"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to give you a good deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount to $13,500, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a really nice product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Your final offer is a bit higher than I can justify. I could meet you halfway at $12,750.  Let me know if that works for you.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my desired price. I can offer you a slight discount to $13,200. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $12,975?",12975.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,975. I can offer you a slight discount to $13,500, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the deadline. If we can't come to an agreement, I may need to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,9,
