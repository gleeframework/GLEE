Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth the asking price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to be bolder in her initial offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is friendly and invites a counter-offer from Bob. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then gradually reduce the price, aiming to stay above her minimum of $12,000 while still trying to maximize her profit."
