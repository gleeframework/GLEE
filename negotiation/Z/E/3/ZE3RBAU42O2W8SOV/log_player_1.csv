"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point given Bob's value for the product. It leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm getting a decent profit.  I'm optimistic that Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking for something within my budget of $150. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I want to try and get closer to my initial offer of $140. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still staying within your budget."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $135 as the price for the product, which is within both our budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is insistent on $135. While it's not ideal, it's still above my minimum and is within my budget.  I'm choosing to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
