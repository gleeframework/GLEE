Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's worth to me.  I'm confident this offer represents a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
