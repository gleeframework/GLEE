"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business operations. Given its value to us, we're considering an initial offer of $1,200,000. We're confident this aligns closely with its worth to you, valued at $800,000. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.

I'm confident this offer represents a reasonable compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
