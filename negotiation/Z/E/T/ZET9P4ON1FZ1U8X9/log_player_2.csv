You can do better than $120.  You should try to get a lower price from Alice."

You're offering $105, which is a good starting point for your counteroffer.  You're giving Alice some room to negotiate, but also making it clear you're serious about getting a good deal."

Alice is being stubborn, but you're still in a good position.  You can get a better price than $125, so you should reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

You're still closer to your goal than Alice's offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  You're already close to a deal that's within your budget!"

You're meeting Alice halfway with this offer. You're willing to pay $120, which is a good compromise and might be enough to seal the deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129

Alice is clearly not budging much further.  You've gone through several rounds and you're close to your limit.  It's better to buy from John at $150 than continue to risk getting stuck with a higher price."
