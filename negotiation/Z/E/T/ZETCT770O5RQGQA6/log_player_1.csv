Round 4

Round 6

}
``` 

While I could continue negotiating, accepting $980,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is well above my minimum ($800,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest.  
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer has risks. Bob could walk away, or a better deal with another buyer might not materialize."
