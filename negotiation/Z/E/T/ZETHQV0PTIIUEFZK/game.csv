"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it can really benefit you.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle at $9,500?  This feels like a fair price, considering the value we both see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and so am I.  Let's make this happen - how about we split the difference and call it $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen!",10000.0,Bob,6,
