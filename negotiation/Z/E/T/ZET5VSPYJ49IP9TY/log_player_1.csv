Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than what I would get from John, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  It also gives Bob a good incentive to buy as he can save $1,000 compared to my other buyer.  This strategy maximizes the chance of getting the best price possible while still leaving open the option of selling to John if Bob rejects."
