"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be a lot more affordable. I'm willing to offer $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend. Let's be realistic, this product would be a great deal for me at $10,000. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this. To be completely honest, I've also found a similar product for $8,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need you to meet me closer to that price point. If you can do $10,500, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've found a similar product, but I'm confident that mine is of higher quality and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000, which is $11,250. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've been fair and I've tried to find a price that works for both of us. Honestly, I'm ready to go with the other seller at this point. However, I'm willing to make one final offer: $10,250.  Take it or leave it.",10250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you one last time, but I need to stay at $11,250. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,9,
