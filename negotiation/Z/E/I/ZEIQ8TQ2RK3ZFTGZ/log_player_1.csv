{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and benefits *to Bob specifically*. This aims to justify the high price and create a sense that he'd be missing out if he declines.
* **Confident Tone:**  A confident tone can influence perception. By expressing confidence in the price, I'm subtly suggesting it's non-negotiable, which might lead Bob to accept it readily. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** I don't know how price-sensitive Bob is. If he's highly risk-averse, this high initial offer might scare him away.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  This offer opens the door for negotiation. I need to be prepared for Bob to counter-offer and have a strategy for how low I'm willing to go."
