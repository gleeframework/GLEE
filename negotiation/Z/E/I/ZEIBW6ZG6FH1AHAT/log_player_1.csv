Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that is above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially make a new one, but I'm always ready to sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for some profit. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John for $80 by being too greedy."
