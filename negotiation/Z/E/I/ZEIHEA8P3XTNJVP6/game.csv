"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
