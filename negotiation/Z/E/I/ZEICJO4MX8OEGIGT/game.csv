"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While $1,200,000 is a reasonable starting point, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more beneficial for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $975,000. I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm offering the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to $1,015,000?  This would be a significant saving for me while still securing you a good price.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to give away too much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,015,000. I'm offering the product for $1,045,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1045000.0,Alice,7,
