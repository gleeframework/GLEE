Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. $700,000 is significantly less than what I need and I can get more from John. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still leaves room for a profit for you, while ensuring I can meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
