# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
