"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make it work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we try $700,000? That's a significant offer on my part.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
