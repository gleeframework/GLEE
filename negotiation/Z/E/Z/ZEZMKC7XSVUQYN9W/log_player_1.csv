Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell for less than your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is phrased to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's completely turned off by the price, he'll likely reject it outright. If he's interested but wants to haggle, he'll counter-offer. 
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies you have other options and creates a subtle sense of urgency.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price point that's acceptable to you. You always have John as a backup."
