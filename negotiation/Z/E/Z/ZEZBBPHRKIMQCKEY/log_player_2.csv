"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $1,000,000 by its current owner. I understand its immense value to you and am excited to offer it to you. Considering the high demand and the unique nature of this product, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. This offer represents an exceptional opportunity to acquire such a valuable item at a price that is only slightly above its intrinsic value. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this transaction. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value in her message. You know it's worth significantly less to her ($800,000). 
* While $950,000 is slightly below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer. This might make her counter with a lower price, or you can go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000 price."
