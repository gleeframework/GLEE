"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $80. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I want to earn as much as possible. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $100.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and there's potential to negotiate further. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll use the next round to counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, still aiming for a profit above $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** $90 is still above my minimum and allows me to make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message uses a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** $85 is only $5 below my initial offer and still significantly higher than my minimum of $80.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of losing Bob entirely increases.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and profit within a reasonable timeframe. 
* **Limited Upside:**  There's a chance Bob won't budge further, and I could end up with a lower price or a failed negotiation.  Accepting his offer minimizes risk and secures a good profit."
