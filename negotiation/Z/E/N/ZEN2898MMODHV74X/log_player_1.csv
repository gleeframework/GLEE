Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a premium price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,200,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this initial price, it establishes a perception of high value.
* **Sense of Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and consider a higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer provides ample room for negotiation.  If Bob counters, there's space to gradually reduce the price while still aiming for a final sale price well above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows about John, Alice's negotiating position weakens."
