"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I believe my offer of $1,200,000 was more than fair.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
