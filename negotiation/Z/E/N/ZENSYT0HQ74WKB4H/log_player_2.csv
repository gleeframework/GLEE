"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. Rejecting gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a strong counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This achieves a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counter-offer will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establishes a lower anchor:** Even if Alice rejects this offer outright, it sets a lower reference point for future rounds of negotiation.
* **Leaves room to maneuver:** We've left a gap between our offer and our maximum budget, allowing us to potentially increase our offer slightly if needed. 

Our message is also polite and professional, maintaining a good negotiating relationship with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on. Let's find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above both your budget and John's offer.  There's room for negotiation, and you're not in a rush. Rejecting again keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I believe my offer of $1,200,000 was more than fair.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not dramatically. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below Alice's current offer and closer to John's.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):**  Mentioning ""hoping we can close the deal soon"" subtly introduces a time element, potentially pushing Alice to be more flexible.
* **Reaffirming Value:** We're reiterating that our offer is strong and a compromise on our part.

This counteroffer aims to bring Alice closer to our desired price range while keeping the option of accepting John's offer on the table if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly, but her offer of $1,550,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price lower than John's. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the best available price."
