"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product to you is significant, and $900,000 is simply too low.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,025,000. This offer reflects its true worth while leaving room for a beneficial deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under a million.  How about $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and recognizes the value, but he's trying hard to stay under $1,000,000. We're still in a good position to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a price point under a million, but I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle this now - $990,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, drawing out the negotiation further might backfire. This offer is a strong signal that we're near the bottom line while still aiming for a price above John's offer. The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure for Bob to accept."
