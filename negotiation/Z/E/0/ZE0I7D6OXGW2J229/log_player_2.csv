"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my maximum budget and John's offer.  It's worth countering to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Reaction:** This offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative:** I always have the option to go with John's offer of $10,000, so I don't want to appear too eager."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I understand you see the value in this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $14,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $10,000? That's my firm limit."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum budget. This signals to Alice that I'm serious but also unwilling to go any higher.
* **Firm but Polite:** By stating it's my ""firm limit,"" I'm being clear about my boundaries while maintaining a polite and respectful tone.
* **John's Offer:**  Alice knows I have the option to buy from John at $10,000. By matching that price, I'm making it clear that accepting this offer is in her best interest if she wants to make the sale."
