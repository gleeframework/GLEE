"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.

"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,225,000 for the product. This price still allows me to save some money compared to your original asking price and provides a reasonable profit for you.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
