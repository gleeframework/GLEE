It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice. You can still get the product for less than $800,000 from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice's offer is now within your budget, and although you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal completely. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's still a good deal for you."
