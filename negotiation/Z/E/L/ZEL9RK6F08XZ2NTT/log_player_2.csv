"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. While $8,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  He should try to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $7,750? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,200, which is only $200 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice won't budge further.  Accepting this offer will save Bob $1,800 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering his goal is to save money."
