"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that's beneficial for both of us. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
