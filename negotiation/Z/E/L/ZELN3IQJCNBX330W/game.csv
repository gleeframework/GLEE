,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal happen.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we try $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell at $120. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $135 for the product. Can you meet me at $127.50?",127.5,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go up to $127.50, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $122?",122.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get at least $128 for the product. How about we try $128?",128.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $128. I've already gone as low as I can. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $80.,80.0,Bob,10,
