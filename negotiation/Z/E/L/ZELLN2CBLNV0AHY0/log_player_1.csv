{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.  It also includes a positive and enthusiastic message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to compromise too much. John is a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so it's a safer bet to sell to him."
