"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000? That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
