Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum price of $100, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further. I'll also keep John in mind, as he's a guaranteed $100 sale if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $108 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $111? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 111} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $111 is a good deal for me, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $109 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $115, Bob's offer of $109 is very close to my minimum price and still profitable for me. It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll accept his offer and move on."
