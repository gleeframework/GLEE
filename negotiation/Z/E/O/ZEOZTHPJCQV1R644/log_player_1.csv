"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. I'm also setting a clear expectation that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping I can push him a bit closer to my price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while also ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a bit more in the next round. I'm also starting to consider the option of selling to John, as his offer is getting more attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm going to stick with my minimum price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. It's not worth risking losing out on John's guaranteed $12,000."
