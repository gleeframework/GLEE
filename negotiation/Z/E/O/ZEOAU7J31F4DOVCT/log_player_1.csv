Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is above Bob's valuation of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary.  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $100 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $80. 
* **Open room for negotiation:**  Leaving space for Bob to counter ensures that we can potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Secure a quick sale:**  Offering a price close to Bob's potential value could lead to a quicker sale than waiting for a counteroffer.

However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will be ready to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or making a new counteroffer of my own. I'm also aware that I can always choose to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  $65 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I need to push for a better price. 

By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to reach a price that is closer to my desired amount.  If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Stay above my minimum acceptable price:**  $85 is still higher than my minimum price of $120, ensuring that I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Show flexibility:** By proposing a middle ground, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Gauge Bob's true interest:** If Bob is willing to accept a price closer to my minimum, it suggests he is serious about buying the product. 

This counteroffer offers a balanced approach, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm confident that $85 is a fair price considering Bob's initial offer and my own minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $75? That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is tempting as it is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offers, it is still below my target price. I believe that I can push for a bit more. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows Bob that I am not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Explore a compromise:**  I can potentially make another counteroffer that might bridge the gap between our desired prices.

However, I need to be cautious.  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, and I should not let the negotiations drag on indefinitely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $80? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Maintains a firm position:**  $80 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but acknowledges his budget constraints.
* **Offers a compromise:**  By proposing a price halfway between our last offers, I demonstrate a willingness to find a solution. 
* **Prevents a stalemate:** This counteroffer could lead to a quick agreement, avoiding further negotiation rounds and potentially losing John as a buyer.

However, if Bob still rejects this offer, I will have to re-evaluate my options.  Selling to John for $120 is always a possibility, and I need to ensure that I don't lose too much time with Bob if he is unwilling to compromise."
