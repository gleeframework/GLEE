"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $75? That's the most I can offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $80? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Alice,5,
