"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering my maximum limit, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Given my initial offer and your counteroffer, I believe a price of $1,500,000 would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
