"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **John's offer:** $120, your upper limit.

Since Alice's offer is above your limit, you should reject it. There's still room for negotiation, and you might be able to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** You want to start by getting as close to your target price as possible without being unreasonable. 
* **Counteroffer:** $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between your target price and Alice's offer. This shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Message:** The message is polite and expresses your interest in the product while explaining your reasoning for the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $108. This is still a bit higher than your ideal price, but it's within your budget and getting closer. 
* **Your goal:** Save money, but you're also willing to buy within your budget.
* **John's offer:** $120. You still have room to negotiate with Alice, but John's offer is your upper limit.

Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product within your budget and leaves room for potential further negotiation later. It's a good middle ground."
