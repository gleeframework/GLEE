While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $881,250 is a strong deal.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the chance Bob walks away.
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to make a deal, which is good for future interactions."
