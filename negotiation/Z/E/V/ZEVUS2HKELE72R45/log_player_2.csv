# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your maximum price of $10,000.  You can get the product for cheaper from John, so it's best to buy from John."
