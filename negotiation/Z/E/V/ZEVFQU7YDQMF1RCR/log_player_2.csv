Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, but that's as close as I can get to $13,750 without losing money on the deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her $14,000+ price point. While a deal around $13,750 might have been ideal, the risk of Alice walking away and the potential savings of $4,250 by buying from John outweigh the potential to save a few hundred more dollars."
