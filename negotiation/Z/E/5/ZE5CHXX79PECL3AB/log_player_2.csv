# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for a better deal."

While $850,000 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still more than I want to pay. I'll try another counteroffer."

At this point, $825,000 is a good deal considering John would charge $1,000,000. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
