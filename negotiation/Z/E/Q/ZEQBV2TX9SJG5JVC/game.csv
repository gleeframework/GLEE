"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $1,500,000.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
