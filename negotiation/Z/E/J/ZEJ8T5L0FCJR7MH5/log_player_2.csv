"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John is willing to sell the product for $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $110 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum price point of $120. You can continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm happy to pay $105, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'm now offering the product to you for $108. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget of $120 and represents a significant discount from her initial offer. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk losing the deal altogether or having to buy from John at $120.  Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation to secure the product at a good price."
