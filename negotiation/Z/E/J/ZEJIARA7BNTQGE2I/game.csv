"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still offers you a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
