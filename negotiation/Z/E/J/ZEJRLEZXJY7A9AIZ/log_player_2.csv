Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $1,075,000.  At this point, the potential savings of continuing the negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is the safer option to ensure you get the product."
