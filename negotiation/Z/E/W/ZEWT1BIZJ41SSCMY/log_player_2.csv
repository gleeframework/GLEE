"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $175 is above his maximum budget of $120, and there's no reason to accept it on the first round.  He can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $155 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum willingness to pay. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a deal, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for around $140. Let me know if you're willing to come down a little bit."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $140 is definitely closer, but I'm still a bit too high at that price. Would you be willing to come up to $145? It's a small step closer to your target, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $145 is close to his maximum, he can still try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  He might be able to get Alice down to $140 or even closer to his target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $142? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 142} 
```"
