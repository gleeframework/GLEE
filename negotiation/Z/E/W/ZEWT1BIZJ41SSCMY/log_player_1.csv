"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) but lower than what it's worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the deal being ""great"" for both of us, fostering a cooperative tone. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $175, I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer without immediately resorting to John. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to make sure the deal goes through. Starting high allows me to potentially earn more, but if Bob refuses, I can use John as a safety net. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses over the next 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $130.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $130 is below my minimum acceptable price ($150). 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway, but I won't go below my minimum price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $155? This would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($130). 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasize a ""good deal"" for both of us. 
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  While $155 is closer to my minimum, I'm still leaving some room for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer if he's still hesitant.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer positions me to potentially secure a deal at a price I'm happy with.  I'm using a compromise strategy to show flexibility while still protecting my minimum price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and continue to negotiate or consider selling to John as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a deal, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for around $140. Let me know if you're willing to come down a little bit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm aiming to make a profit and earn at least $150 from this sale.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but I won't go below $145. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $150, which gives me a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $140 is definitely closer, but I'm still a bit too high at that price. Would you be willing to come up to $145? It's a small step closer to your target, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($155) and Bob's current offer ($140). 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** My message highlights that I'm willing to come down in price and that we're ""bridging the gap.""
* **Focus on Fairness:** I mention ""fair profit"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity in the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing a strategy of compromise while still staying above my minimum price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before needing to resort to selling to John.  This round is crucial, as we're getting closer to a potential agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely have to make a more significant compromise or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $142? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $142 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, considering that we are in round 6 and have already had several back-and-forths, it's likely that further negotiation may not yield a much higher offer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, albeit slightly less than my ideal outcome.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I need to balance the potential for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether. Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum to make it worth accepting. It also shows that he's willing to meet me halfway, indicating a potential for a positive future relationship if I decide to continue selling to him."
