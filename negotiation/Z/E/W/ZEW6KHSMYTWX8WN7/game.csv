"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further.
