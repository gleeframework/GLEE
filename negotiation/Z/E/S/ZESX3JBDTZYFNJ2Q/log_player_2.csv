"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for Bob, so it's better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob can likely secure a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this. How about $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, splitting the difference is a fair approach.  However, to make it worthwhile on my end, I'd need to settle at $1,090,000.  This offer reflects my final position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's final offer is $1,090,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price and within his budget. It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000, so Bob should accept the offer."
