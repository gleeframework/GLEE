"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,400,000.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
