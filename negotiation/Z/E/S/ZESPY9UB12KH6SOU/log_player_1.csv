Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000?

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, negotiations have stalled, and I'm running out of time. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates any further risk of a lower price."
