This offer is significantly above my minimum value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the product's worth to Bob, which could make him more willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I initially proposed.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,050,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer in future rounds.  It's more profitable than selling to John."
