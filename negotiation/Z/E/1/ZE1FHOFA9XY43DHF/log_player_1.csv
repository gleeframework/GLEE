I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to sell it, $75 is below my minimum. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to sell to John for $80.  Bob is very close to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, I might end up with a lower price than I want.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $80 from John."
