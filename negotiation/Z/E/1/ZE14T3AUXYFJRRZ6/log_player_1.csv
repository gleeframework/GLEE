"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive message:** I aim to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.  
* **Open ended question:** This encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

**Important:**  Since we don't know Bob's value for the product, a high starting point allows for more potential profit. However, it's a risk, as he might walk away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **RejectOffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired price.  I believe I can get more by continuing to negotiate. 

* **Reasoning:** I have 10 rounds to close a deal, and selling to John for $8,000 is always an option.  My strategy is to use this time to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I need to get closer to $9,500 to make this work for me. What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $9,500. This is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating Bob's offer as a starting point, and emphasizing the need for a price closer to my desired price point. 
* **Open-ended question:** Again, I'm encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation and provide a response.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation, bridging the gap between our desired prices in a way that keeps Bob engaged. 
* By offering a specific price, I'm showing that I'm serious about negotiating and making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **AcceptOffer:** I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,800. 
* **Reasoning:**
    * This is a significant improvement over John's offer of $8,000.
    *  We're now in Round 4, and while I would like to get closer to $9,500, there's a risk of losing the deal completely if I continue to counteroffer.  
    *  $8,800 is close enough to my minimum desired price of $8,000 to make it a worthwhile deal. 

**Strategy:** 

* It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether.  In this situation,  accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit while leaving room for potential future deals."
