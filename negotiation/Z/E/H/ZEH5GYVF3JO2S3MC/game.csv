"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just doesn't work for me. The product is worth more than that to me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  It's still a good deal for both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $107.50 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we settle on $106?  That way we're both getting a fair deal.  What do you say?",106.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but $106 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $104?",104.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $104 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we settle on $105?  That's my final offer.  If you don't accept, I'm going to have to sell it to someone else.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,

I'm not willing to go up to $105. How about we meet at $103?,103.0,Bob,8,
