Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed $150 from John, getting more from Bob is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below my minimum allows room for Bob to counter-offer. There's a chance he might accept outright.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to find a balance between a price appealing to Bob while still maximizing my potential profit."
