Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to find out how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer, it's still not enough for me. I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, so I'll sell it to him for $15,000."
