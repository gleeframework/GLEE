"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $900,000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
