{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a price point that is a fair compromise.  It's lower than my minimum but still higher than what Bob values the product at. 
* The **message** is friendly and positive, aiming to keep the negotiation going smoothly. 
* This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's tempting to close the deal,  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive.** I can try to reach a more profitable agreement by sending a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but it's not the most strategic move yet.**  There's still potential to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? That's a significant discount from my initial asking price and still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** $12,500 is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's a significant step closer to my minimum price and hopefully more appealing to Bob. 
* **Message is positive and encouraging:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic move:** This counteroffer keeps the door open for a successful negotiation while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500, which would be $11,750. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Rejecting the offer gives me more leverage.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. 
* **Selling to John is still an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.** I'm optimistic that I can push for a price closer to $13,000 or $14,000 through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,750 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,125? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** $12,125 is a midpoint between Bob's last offer and my desired price, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Message is positive and encouraging:** The message emphasizes fairness and compromise, creating a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Strategic move:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my financial interests. It's a reasonable price that could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $12,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the price I was initially considering buying the product from John for. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's a significant improvement, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful.** Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go higher than $12,000.
* **Selling to John is the best option.**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I'm confident that I'll get the best deal by selling to him.

By selling to John, I ensure that I'm not losing money on the sale and can move on to other opportunities."
