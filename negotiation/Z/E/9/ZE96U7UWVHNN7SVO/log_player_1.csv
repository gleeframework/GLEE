"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, I want to see if I can get even more. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $105, $95 is a good price, and I'm worried about running out of rounds.  It's also better than selling to John for $100, as I'm still earning a profit."
