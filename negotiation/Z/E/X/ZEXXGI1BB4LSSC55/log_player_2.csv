"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I think you'll really love this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his target price of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, and he can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his target of $15,000.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since he has the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to me. Let's find a common ground here."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to meet your budget. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $15,000.  At this point, Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $15,000, so it makes sense to go with the sure thing. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he's already used up 4 rounds of negotiation."
