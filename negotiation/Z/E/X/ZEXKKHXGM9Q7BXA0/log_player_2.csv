"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on your price, but I have to stick to my budget. How about $12,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make to get this deal done today."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $13,500? This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this today! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, we're getting close to the point where it might be better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $12,750. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12750} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to signal to Alice that we're nearing our limit.  The phrase ""final offer"" conveys seriousness.
* **Justification:** We're giving a reason for our price, making it seem more grounded and less arbitrary.
* **Alternative:**  By mentioning ""other options"" (i.e., John), we remind Alice that we have a backup plan if she doesn't budge."
