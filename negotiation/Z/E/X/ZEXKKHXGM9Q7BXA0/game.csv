"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget. How about $12,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on your price, but I have to stick to my budget. How about $12,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make to get this deal done today.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $13,500? This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this today!",13500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $12,750. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",12750.0,Bob,8,
