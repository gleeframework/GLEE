Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer in terms of ""value"" and ""potential"" can make the higher price more palatable. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The high initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  You can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000 but lower than $1,200,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, his negotiating style, and market dynamics could influence your approach."
