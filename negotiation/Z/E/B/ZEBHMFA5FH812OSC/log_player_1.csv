Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. If Bob accepts, you gain an extra $500,000. If he rejects it, you can still sell to John at your desired minimum price."
