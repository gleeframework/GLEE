"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original offer. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great product at a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and $11,000 is still a bit higher than he'd like to pay. He's willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to his target price of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll come down to $10,875. It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my original offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $10,875 is a reasonable price for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Progress:** Alice is coming down on her price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Time:**  The negotiation is moving forward, and Bob is getting closer to his target price.

While Bob might want to try for a slightly lower price, there's a good chance that Alice will counter with a price even higher than $10,875.  Accepting this offer saves Bob time and ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price."
