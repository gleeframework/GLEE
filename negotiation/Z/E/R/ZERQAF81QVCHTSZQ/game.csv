"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $150. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $145?",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $175 and $145. How about we try $160? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $145, which would be $152.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",152.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. It's still a great price for this product, and I think it's worth it. Would you be willing to meet me at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not willing to pay $155. I'm willing to meet you at $152.50, as I mentioned before. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm starting to think I'll have to walk away and buy it from John for $150. What do you think?",152.5,Bob,6,
