"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  This would be a good deal for me and allows you to still make a significant profit.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain while still acknowledging the investment I've made.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I need to see a more significant movement to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for you, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but the gap is still pretty wide for me.  To be frank, I'm only willing to go as high as $900,000 for this product.  If that doesn't work for you, I may need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
