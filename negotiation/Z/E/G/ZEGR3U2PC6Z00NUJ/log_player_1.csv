Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I still think $8,200 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $7,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. Can we consider this offer?

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price significantly lower than both your minimum and his own valuation of the product.  It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher. Taking the guaranteed $8,000 from John is the best option at this point to avoid further risk of losing a sure sale."
