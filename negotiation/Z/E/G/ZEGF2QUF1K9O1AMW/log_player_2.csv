"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  It's worth exploring negotiation first to see if I can save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value it holds for me and provides a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and then going back to her initial price (or even higher) is present.  At this point, accepting the offer and saving $350,000 compared to buying from John is the best course of action."
