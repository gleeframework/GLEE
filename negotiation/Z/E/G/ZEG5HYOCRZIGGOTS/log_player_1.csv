Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, I'm hoping to get a good starting point.  However, I'm open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind the value to me and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counter with a higher price and try to find a middle ground.  I still have 8 rounds left and  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.  I'm confident I can reach a better price in the remaining rounds, and John is always an option if things fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise, showing flexibility while still securing a profit. I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds go by, but I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and with only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's time to accept this offer and secure a profit, even if it's not my ideal outcome."
