"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this product to be a great value. Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Alice,5,
