# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I estimate its value to be $12000 to me. Considering its worth to you is $8000, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9500. This is an opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her estimated value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, saving him $1,500."
