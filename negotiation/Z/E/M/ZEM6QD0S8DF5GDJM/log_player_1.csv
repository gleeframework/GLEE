{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects it, we can adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's only slightly above my minimum price. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price of $135, so I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
