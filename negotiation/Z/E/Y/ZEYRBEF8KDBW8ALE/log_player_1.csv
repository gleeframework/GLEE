"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, it's still a significant profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I still believe I can get a better deal, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about closing this deal. With only five rounds left, I'm running out of time, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to consider.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get him up to my desired price.  I'm going to sell to John, as it's the best option for me at this point."
