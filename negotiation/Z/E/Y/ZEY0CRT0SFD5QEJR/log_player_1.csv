{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum requirement of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point that balances maximizing my profit with the possibility of a successful negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, especially considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to explore a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the significant value the product holds for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for me, and while I would have preferred a higher price, I'm satisfied with this outcome."
