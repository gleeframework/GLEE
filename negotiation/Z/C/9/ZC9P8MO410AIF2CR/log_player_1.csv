Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than the product's value to you, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:** It's within the range of what Bob is likely willing to pay, given the value to him.
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:**  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $17000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum of $15,000.  You can do better.  

You'll counteroffer Bob to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $15250?  That's closer to my budget and a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,250 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $15,000 and still a fair deal for both of you.  You're better off securing this sale than risking a further round of negotiations or selling to John for a lower price."
