Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it could be hugely beneficial to you. I'm asking for $1,199,999.  Let me know if you're interested, this offer is valid for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you should aim for a price slightly below that to incentivize Bob.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a 24-hour time limit might encourage Bob to make a decision faster and potentially accept the offer without further negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value of $800,000. This offer assumes he might be willing to stretch his budget for the right opportunity.
* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you want to negotiate or stick to John's guaranteed offer."
