"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle of the middle, at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  How about $1,025,000, and we have a deal?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
