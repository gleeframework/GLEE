"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the tone for negotiation and gives me room to maneuver. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that Bob's value for the product is significantly lower than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still far from my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or, if necessary, sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  I'll use the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. I'm not desperate and want to continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room for a higher price, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but at a slower pace. This signals my willingness to compromise while still holding out for a substantial profit.  At this point, $1,400,000 is still within a reasonable margin for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. There's still a decent chance I can get a higher price from Bob, and I want to keep negotiating with him. I don't want to sell to John just yet because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get a higher price from Bob. I've lowered my offer significantly and am almost at my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is too far below my minimum price, and there are only two rounds left. I'm confident I can get a better price from John, who is willing to pay my minimum. I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk a further decrease in price with Bob."
