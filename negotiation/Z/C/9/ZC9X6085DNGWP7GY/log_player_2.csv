"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still too high. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can get a lower price. There are still many rounds left, and I can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $780,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly and is now at $800,000.  This is a good price for me, and I'm not sure I can get much lower.  There are still 5 rounds left, but I don't want to risk Alice getting frustrated and sticking with her current offer, or worse, raising her price back up.  I'm happy to secure this deal at $800,000."
