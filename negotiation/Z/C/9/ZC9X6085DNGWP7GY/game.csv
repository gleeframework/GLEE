"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $780,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
