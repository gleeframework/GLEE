"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1300000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
