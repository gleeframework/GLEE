"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1200000, which would be $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
