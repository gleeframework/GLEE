"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. If you're open to that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you.",8750.0,Bob,4,
