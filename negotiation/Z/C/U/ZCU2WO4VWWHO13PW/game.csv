"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, I'm only willing to pay $14000 for it.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product considering what I'm willing to spend. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16500. However,  I'm still not comfortable going that high.  I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $16250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",16250.0,Alice,5,
