Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Knowing its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique product with significant potential, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts on this offer."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation helps, starting with a price closer to your own desired outcome ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message avoids hardball tactics and instead focuses on the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" subtly implying it's worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Pressure Point:** The mention of ""a unique product"" hints at scarcity, subtly pressuring Bob to consider the offer seriously knowing you have other options (John).

**The Goal:** This offer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're starting from a position where a sale above his $1,000,000 valuation is more likely."
