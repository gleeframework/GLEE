"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. Given my research and the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price is within my budget and would allow us both to benefit from a successful deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects a more agreeable middle ground, don't you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
