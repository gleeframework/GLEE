"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. It's a fair deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a great product at a competitive price. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's still a great value for you, considering what the product is worth. Let's keep the negotiation going!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $1312500. This price is still a good deal for me, and it's only a small increase from your last offer. Let's close this deal and be done with it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $12,500 higher than Bob's target of $1,300,000, but with only three rounds remaining, it's a good compromise.  Bob has already significantly lowered the price from Alice's initial $1,400,000 offer. Accepting the offer allows him to secure the product at a reasonable price while still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's a chance he could get a slightly lower price by continuing, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
