"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's much too early to accept Alice's offer. $500,000 is a great price, but there's no indication of how much Alice needs to get for the product.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows for potential negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to get a sense of Alice's bottom line early in the negotiation. If Alice accepts, I've gotten a great deal. If she rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down from her initial offer, but $400,000 is still significantly higher than my initial counteroffer. I'm aiming for a lower price and want to see if I can further negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also pushing to get a better price.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and this counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $350,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer of $250,000. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my next offer and potentially increasing her price is too high.  This price is within my budget and a good deal, so accepting it minimizes the risk of losing the product or having to pay a higher price later."
