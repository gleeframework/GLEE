"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825,000 is still above my target price. Let's find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and our respective needs. It's a significant offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering it to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a stretch for me, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to offer $825,000, which is a fair compromise that considers both our needs.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's make this deal happen.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your urgency, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I'm still looking for $845,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",845000.0,Alice,7,
