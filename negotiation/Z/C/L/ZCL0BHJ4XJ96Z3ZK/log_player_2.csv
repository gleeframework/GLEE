"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000 and John is selling for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can get the product for the same price from John without the hassle."
