"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and then some.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
