"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm aiming to start the bidding at $22,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and then some."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. Taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the best move at this point."
