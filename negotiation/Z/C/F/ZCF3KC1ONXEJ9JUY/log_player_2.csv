"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I understand its worth to you might be significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell it for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its potential value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
