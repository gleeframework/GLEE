"I see you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
