Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. How about we try to find a middle ground again? I'm willing to meet you at $1,330,000. Can you consider that?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,000,000 to John, and Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is greater than that.  It's a decent deal that nets Alice a significant profit, and is likely the best she can achieve in the limited rounds remaining.  There's no guarantee that further rounds will lead to a better outcome."
