"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1400000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I acknowledge your budget constraints, $1400000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1450000? This would give us both a fair deal.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $1425000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's go with $1437500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1437500.0,Alice,5,
