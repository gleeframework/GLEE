"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product would really benefit you, and this price reflects its worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap here. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between what we both consider fair.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my absolute best offer. This price takes into account the true value of what you're getting.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $14,000. This is a good compromise and reflects my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
