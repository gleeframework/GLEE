"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can offer $850,000. This is a fair offer considering your original asking price and my initial offer.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000 is too high for me. Let's try $915,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but we need to find a compromise.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $870,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I hope you can see I'm serious about purchasing the product.",870000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the increase, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm thinking $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $885,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",885000.0,Alice,9,
