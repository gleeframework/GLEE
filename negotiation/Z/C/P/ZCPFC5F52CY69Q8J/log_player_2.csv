"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's below your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product.  This price still leaves significant room for profit on your end. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high. We're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,050,000 is still significantly more than our initial counteroffer of $950,000.  There's likely room for further negotiation before we reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but I'm going to have to stick to my previous price of $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on the product.  I'm confident that this is a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,050,000, but it's still too high for us. We've already offered $1,000,000, which is closer to our desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and we have several rounds left.  We should try to push for a slightly lower price before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit.  I hope we can find a way to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
