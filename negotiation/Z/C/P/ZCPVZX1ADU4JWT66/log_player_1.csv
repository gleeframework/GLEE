Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to me! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob without you having to sell below your minimum.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still being open to negotiation.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and John is ready to buy at my desired price.  Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer is the best course of action.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and still leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:**  I've moved from $130 to $110, which is significantly closer to my desired price of $150.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Give Bob a reason to accept:** I've explicitly stated that $110 is a ""significant discount"" from my previous offer,  making it seem like a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  If we can meet in the middle, I'd be happy to buy it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, as he seems unwilling to meet my price.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price, so selling to John is the best choice to maximize my profits."
