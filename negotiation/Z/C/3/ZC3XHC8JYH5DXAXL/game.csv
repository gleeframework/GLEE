"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying the product from John for that price if we can't reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
