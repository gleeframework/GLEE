Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has increased his offer again and stated this is his final offer. While I might be able to push for a bit more, accepting his offer at $1,900,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
