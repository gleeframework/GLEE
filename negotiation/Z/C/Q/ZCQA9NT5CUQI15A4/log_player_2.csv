"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. It's worth negotiating further with Alice to see if you can lower the price. You still have a significant amount of room to negotiate before reaching your maximum price of $1,500,000."

I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer you $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and your own valuation.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000 for the product. I believe it's a fair compromise, taking into account your initial valuation and my own minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down further, especially since you're still well below your maximum budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can find a price that's more favorable to you."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $975,000? This price is a good compromise and reflects both of our needs.  Let's aim for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of Alice, the negotiation is getting close to a stalemate. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,025,000 is a good deal for you as it still saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer might lead Alice to walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price."
