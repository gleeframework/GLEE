"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a higher price than $1,750,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,850,000.  I'm getting closer to his offer, but I still believe I can get a little more.  We're in the middle of the negotiation, and I'm trying to find a compromise we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get more, this is a good offer. It's getting close to my minimum price, and with only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and ending up with only John's offer of $1,500,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
