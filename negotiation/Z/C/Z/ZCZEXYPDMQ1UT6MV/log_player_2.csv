"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming to pay as little as possible, and $1,400,000 is still significantly more than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a backup:** Having John's offer as a fallback gives you negotiating power. You're not desperate to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While she has come down, $1,300,000 is still a significant markup from her valuation of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room for you to negotiate a better price, especially as you have John's offer as a backup.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice is showing willingness to negotiate. You can likely get a better price by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my own valuation. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal:**  $1,275,000 is only $25,000 more than your last offer. 
* **Risk of going higher:**  If you reject this offer and counter, there's a risk Alice might not budge further, and you might be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time pressure:** You've already used 5 rounds, and you want to maximize your chances of getting the best deal.

While you could potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
