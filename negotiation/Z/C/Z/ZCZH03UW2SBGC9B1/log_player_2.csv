"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price reflecting its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Let's work together to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his desired range.  There's still time to explore options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $11,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting. Let's find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 9500}
