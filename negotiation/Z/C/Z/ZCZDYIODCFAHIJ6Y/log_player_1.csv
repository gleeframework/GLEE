Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I believe it's something that would be valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, even though I don't know it. This could make him more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

This approach aims to start the negotiation strategically, leaving room for potential compromise while also aiming for a higher price than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum of $10,000, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I want to try to push for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to accept a price that is too low.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  This conveys a willingness to negotiate while also showing that I'm confident in the value of the product.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the potential value for him.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is higher than my minimum of $10,000. This is a good outcome for me, especially considering that I'm already at the third round of negotiation. It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for the lower price of $10,000."
