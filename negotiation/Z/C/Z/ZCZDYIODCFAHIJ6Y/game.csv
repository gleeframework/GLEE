"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I believe it's something that would be valuable for you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
