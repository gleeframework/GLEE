"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
