I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profit, but also ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
