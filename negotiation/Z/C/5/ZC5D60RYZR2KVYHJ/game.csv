"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a touch high for me. How about $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I can do $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle right in the middle at $12,750? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,750. I can do $13,250, but that's as close as I can get. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",13250.0,Alice,7,
