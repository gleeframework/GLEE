"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
