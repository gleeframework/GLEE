"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's minimum.  He's highlighting the value for Alice, hoping to encourage negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price. $9,000 is better than $10,000, but there's still room to negotiate. He has 7 more rounds to reach a price that works for him, so he's not desperate to accept yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750.  It's a good compromise, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. He's also emphasizing a quick close to create urgency. The offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but closer to her desired price point.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward."
