"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the product's true value to me. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value. Let's keep the conversation going.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000, and I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be a better option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
