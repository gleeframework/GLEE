"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale!  I'm asking $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm also adding a friendly message to make the negotiation more engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it at that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $130. This is still above my minimum and shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm also reinforcing the idea of a ""fair"" price to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still interested in your product but $130 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to pay $110.  Let's split the difference. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob, especially since we have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $115. This is only $5 above my minimum, showing I'm serious about making a deal. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to increase the chances of acceptance."
