"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a significant amount.  I'm starting with an offer of $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $15500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500. Can we meet at this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
