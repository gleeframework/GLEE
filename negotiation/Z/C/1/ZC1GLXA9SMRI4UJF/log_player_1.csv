"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, considering its high value and potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum threshold. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a good price.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's benefits and value to Bob increases his motivation to buy.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. There's potential to get closer to my target with further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge his true willingness to pay. If he's serious about acquiring the product, he'll likely come back with a higher counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Quick Sell:**  Selling to John now would lock in a profit, but it's not maximizing my earnings.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000?  This would give us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""good outcome"" for both of us, focusing on shared benefits rather than just my own profit.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above my minimum threshold, ensuring I won't settle for less than what I consider fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my desired price point. There's potential to secure a better deal with further negotiation.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping open the option of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob falls apart.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I believe I can still find a compromise that satisfies both our needs. I'll use the next round to counter with a price that's closer to my goal but still reasonable for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal work, and I appreciate your efforts. Let's aim for a final number that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a significant amount for me as well."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by dropping my price again, but I'm still aiming for a respectable profit.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  Mentioning a ""final number"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob and encourages him to consider a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing that he's getting a great deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000, which is $975000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is close to my desired price and significantly above my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away completely.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only four rounds left, accepting this offer ensures I secure a good profit and avoids potential losses."
