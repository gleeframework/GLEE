"I'm interested in the product, but I think $850000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering a new price of $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
