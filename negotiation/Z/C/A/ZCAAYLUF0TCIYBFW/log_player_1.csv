Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for your consideration. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $950,000 for it, a price that reflects its potential value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $875,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing for some flexibility.  I hope you'll consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your range and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal for me, and it's likely that we won't get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
