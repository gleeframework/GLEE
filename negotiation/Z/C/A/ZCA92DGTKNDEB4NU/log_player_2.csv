"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. This gives Alice a chance to accept, but also leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and is within Bob's budget.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and potentially even increase her price again.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, allowing Bob to save money while ensuring a deal is reached."
