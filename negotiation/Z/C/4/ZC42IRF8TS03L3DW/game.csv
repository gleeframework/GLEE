"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but $9,000 is a bit steep for my budget right now.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,200 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8100.0,Alice,5,
