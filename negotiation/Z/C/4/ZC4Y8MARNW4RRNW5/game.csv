"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
