Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to my desired profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum price."
