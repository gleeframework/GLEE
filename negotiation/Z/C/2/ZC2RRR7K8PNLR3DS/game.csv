"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree that the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I would be more comfortable with a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $7,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
