"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is asking for $95.
* **It's worth negotiating.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $85 is a significant drop from Alice's asking price but still above her minimum value of $80, making it a potentially agreeable offer.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  The message expresses interest while stating your price point, opening a dialogue for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target price.** Although she's lowered the price, $90 is still above your maximum value of $100.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise while staying within your budget:**  $87.50 is a middle ground between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $90.
* **Show a desire to reach an agreement:**  The message expresses your willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  Offering a specific price encourages Alice to consider a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $88.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close to your target price:** $88.50 is within your budget and only slightly above your ideal price.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it:** You've already gone through several rounds, and Alice seems fairly firm on her price. There's a risk of further negotiations dragging on without a better offer.
* **Buying from John is a backup:** If you reject this offer, you can always buy from John for $100, giving you a safety net.

It's a good compromise that allows you to secure the product while saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
