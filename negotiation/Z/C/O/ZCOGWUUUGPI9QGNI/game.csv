"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you. Let's make a deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $88.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal. Let's finalize this!",88.5,Alice,5,
