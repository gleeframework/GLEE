,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50? It's a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal.",88.5,Alice,5,
