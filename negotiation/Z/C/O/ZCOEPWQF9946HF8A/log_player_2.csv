"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for the product. This offers you a significant discount compared to its market value while ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm not sure why she's willing to sell it to me for $120. I can get it from John for $150, which is still within my budget of $150, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy it from John.
