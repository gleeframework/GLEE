Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob,  which could make him more inclined to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's interest and willingness to counteroffer suggests there's room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. I'll aim for a compromise while still ensuring I get a price that's fair to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $17,000? This would still give you a good deal considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and potentially leads to a quicker agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and aims to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response. If he rejects again, I'll need to assess if I'm willing to further reduce my price or if John's offer becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum. This means I'm not losing any money by accepting, but it also means I'm not gaining anything extra.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiations have gone back and forth, and there's no guarantee that further counteroffers will result in a higher price.  
* **No Upside:**  Considering the time and effort already invested in negotiation, accepting Bob's offer doesn't offer any potential for a better outcome than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

Since John's offer matches my minimum, selling to him ensures a quick and hassle-free transaction with no risk of further negotiation."
