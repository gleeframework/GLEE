"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your budget, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $11500? I think it's a great deal for both of us!",11500.0,Alice,5,
