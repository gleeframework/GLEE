Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
