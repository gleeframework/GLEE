"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
