Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $10,250. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no point in further negotiation."
