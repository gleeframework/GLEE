"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is reflective of its true worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking of making a more modest offer. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low considering the value this product holds.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price reflects both its worth and my willingness to strike a deal with you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $920,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and our negotiation so far.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  How about $935,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $935,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $915,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and our negotiation so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",915000.0,Bob,6,
