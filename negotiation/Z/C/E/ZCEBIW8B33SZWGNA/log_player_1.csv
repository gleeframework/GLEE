Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message aims to convey the product's value to Bob without seeming overly aggressive or dismissive of his potential counter-arguments. 

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for maximizing profit."
