{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, indicating he's likely reaching his maximum.  While $975,000 is a good offer, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting John's offer for $1,200,000 is the best decision for maximizing profit."
