"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $180 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",180.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $190. It's a great compromise, if you ask me!",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $175 for the product. Can we really make a deal at this price?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $185, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, if you ask me!",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $185 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $165 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go as low as $165, Bob, but I'm really close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to meet you at $170, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great compromise, if you ask me!",170.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $170, Alice, but I'm still not sure that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",160.0,Bob,8,
