# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it. If we can reach an agreement, it would be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above my target price, and we're running out of negotiation rounds. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars in negotiation, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings."
