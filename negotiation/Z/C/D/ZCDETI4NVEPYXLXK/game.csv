"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a bit closer to the middle at $95.  Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $105, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value",105.0,Alice,5,
