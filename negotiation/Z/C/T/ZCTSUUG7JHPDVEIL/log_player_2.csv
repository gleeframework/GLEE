"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $9,000, which is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product,  $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about saving money.
* **Realistic Price:** $7,500 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has lowered her price, $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get Alice closer to his target price.
* **Alternative:** Bob has the option of buying from John for $8,000, so there's no immediate need to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $8,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,250?  This would be a good compromise for us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Close to Target:**  $8,250 is just $250 above Bob's maximum, leaving room for a potential final agreement.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** Bob highlights that this offer is a compromise, appealing to Alice's desire to reach a deal."
