Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum value.
* **Start negotiations strong:** A high initial offer sets the stage for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Leave room for compromise:** There's space for both of us to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable price.

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, keeping in mind my minimum value and John's offer as my fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I'm only able to pay up to $8,000 for this product. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. While it's tempting to take $8,000, I'm not willing to compromise that much. 

* **Rejecting his offer:** Keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counter-offer. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which is my fallback option.

I'll use the next round to make a counter-offer that is more reasonable for me, hopefully leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I've offered $8,500, which is a slight concession from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's initial proposal.
* **Compromise:** I've framed it as a fair compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open communication:** The message maintains a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing loss:** While I'm still aiming for a higher price, $8,500 is closer to my minimum value than $8,000. 
* **Strategic compromise:**  This offer leaves room for further negotiation without sacrificing my bottom line too much. 
* **Keeping options open:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000."
