Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price just below my minimum acceptable value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, considering your budget.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming to keep the cost below $130. I'd like to propose a price of $128 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While $128 is getting closer to what I need, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle at $131? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

I'm trying to close the gap by offering a price that's almost exactly in the middle of our last two offers. I'm also reiterating the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $129 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price that's just above my minimum acceptable value, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob and close the deal. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and encouraging a swift conclusion to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $127 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation with Bob has gone on for several rounds, and while we're getting close to my minimum acceptable value, it's taking longer than I'd hoped. I'm starting to worry that we might not reach an agreement before the deadline. It's also worth noting that Bob's offers are becoming increasingly stubborn, suggesting that he might not be willing to budge further.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's a better deal than accepting Bob's offer and it guarantees a quick and easy sale."
