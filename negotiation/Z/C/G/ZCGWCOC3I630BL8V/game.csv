"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. How about we aim for $10,000? I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10,000 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000.  This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can still cover my costs.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've been considering the value of the product and the cost involved, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose we set the price at $9,500. This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget, while still providing you with a fair return for your effort and investment.",9500.0,Bob,4,
