"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal closer to that.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a significant sum, the value of this product is truly unique.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
