Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,999. This offer is only valid for a limited time, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other buyers and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Slight Discount:** The offer is slightly below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob the feeling of getting a deal while maximizing your potential profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the risk that Bob might reject the offer. If you want to guarantee the $15,000 sale, offering it to Bob at that price would be the safest option."
