"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point. This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is higher than Bob's ideal price of $12,000. Bob is still willing to negotiate further as he believes he can get a better price. By rejecting this offer, he can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target price.  It's still cheaper than buying from John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up in her price, but Bob is willing to meet her halfway. Offering $13,000 is a compromise that is still lower than Alice's offer and closer to Bob's ideal price. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price has gone up again.  While Bob still wants to save as much money as possible, he's now at a point where the potential savings from continuing to negotiate are outweighed by the risk of the negotiation breaking down.  He's already spent several rounds of negotiation trying to get a better deal, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept his next counteroffer. 

Buying from John at $15,000 is a guaranteed way to get the product. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
