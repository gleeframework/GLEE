"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his negotiating style. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to close the deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly above my minimum selling price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting this offer allows me to gauge how flexible Bob is and how much higher he might be willing to go. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm not in a rush. Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I've made a substantial concession by reducing my price by $75,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,025,000 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between his last offer and mine. 
* **Maintain Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to justify the price and prevent Bob from lowballing further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $975,000.  This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob's counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments ($950k to $975k). This suggests he's getting closer to his maximum and may be willing to go higher.
* **Profit Margin:** While $975,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still secure a better deal with a bit more negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:**  We're only on round 4, and I have ample time to continue negotiating and exploring Bob's upper limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal, so here's my final offer:  $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant investment from your side while still acknowledging the immense value this product holds for you.  Let's make this happen!"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm presenting this offer as my ""final"" one to signal I'm serious about closing the deal at this price point. 
* **Strong Profit Margin:**  $1,000,000 provides a healthy profit margin while staying realistic about Bob's potential upper limit.
* **Time Factor:** While I have time, dragging the negotiation too long risks losing Bob's interest. This offer aims for a swift and favorable resolution. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup allows me to confidently set this firm offer. If Bob rejects it, I can still walk away with a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and finalize this at $987,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $987,500 is a substantial offer, exceeding my minimum by a significant margin. 
* **Finality:** Bob has signaled this is his final offer, suggesting he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk of Bob walking away and the diminishing returns don't justify it. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides certainty and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
