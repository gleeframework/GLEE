Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for it, since that's what it's worth to me.  Let me know if that works for you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $100, which is his maximum valuation of the product.  There's little chance of negotiating him higher. Since John offers a guaranteed $100, it's more efficient to take the sure sale than to continue haggling with Bob for a potentially marginal gain."
