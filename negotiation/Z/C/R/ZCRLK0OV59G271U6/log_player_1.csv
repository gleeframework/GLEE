"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of earning a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob into accepting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's still lower than my starting price. I'm not willing to accept it immediately.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Test the Waters:** See if Bob is serious about the product and willing to go higher. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting, I maintain control of the negotiation.
* **Potentially Get a Better Price:** I might be able to push for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $9500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's lower than Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. 
* **Compromise:** I'm presenting this offer as a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Messaging:** I continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it for a couple of reasons:

* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a higher price. Bob has expressed interest in the product, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal.
* **Time Remaining:** We have 6 rounds left.  I don't want to rush into accepting an offer that's lower than what I think I can get.

By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price or at least closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This strategy demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move towards a resolution. It also positions my offer as a fair and reasonable midpoint.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm continuing to subtly emphasize the product's value to keep it in the forefront of Bob's mind.
* **Building Momentum:**  This counteroffer shows I'm not just passively waiting for Bob's offer. I'm actively participating in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10250. I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my last counteroffer of $10,500 and is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely by being too stubborn.
* **Value Proposition:** $10,250 is a respectable price for a product worth $8,000 to me.  It's a significant profit, and I'm happy with the outcome.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'm accepting now, I can always use the opportunity to potentially renegotiate the price in the future if the product proves to be even more valuable to Bob."
