Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $115 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially motivating him to accept the offer."
