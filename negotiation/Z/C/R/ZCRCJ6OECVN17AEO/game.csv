"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a price around $10,000. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product to me is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider $15,500, but that's my best and final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
