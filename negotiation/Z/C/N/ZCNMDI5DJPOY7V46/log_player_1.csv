Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is a decent price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $16,500 is only $500 less than my counteroffer and significantly higher than John's offer.  Accepting this offer ensures I sell the product and gain a decent profit."
