Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate to secure a sale. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll see it as a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's room to lower the price if necessary without dropping below my minimum. 
* **John as leverage:**  Mentioning John keeps Bob aware of my other options, motivating him to reach an agreement sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. My goal is to find a middle ground where both of us can be satisfied. The message emphasizes the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate, while still holding firm on my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000. While I would prefer more, it's a reasonable compromise and worth accepting. It's better to secure a sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on both Bob and John."
