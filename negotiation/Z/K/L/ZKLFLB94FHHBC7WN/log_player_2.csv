# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. My next offer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. My next offer is $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can likely still get a better price, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000. He should try to negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,005,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $1,005,000 is still slightly higher than his budget, and he has a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when John is offering a better price."
