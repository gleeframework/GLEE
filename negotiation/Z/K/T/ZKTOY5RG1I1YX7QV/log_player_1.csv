Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value of $100, but not too high that he's likely to reject it. Let's say I offer Bob:

{""product_price"": $110}

This price is $10 more than my minimum value, and it's still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is higher than my minimum value of $100, I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
