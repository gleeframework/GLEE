"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its uniqueness and value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10800. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
