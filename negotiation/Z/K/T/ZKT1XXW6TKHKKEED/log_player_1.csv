Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and leaving room for potential counteroffers. 
* **It sets the tone for a friendly negotiation:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,800 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  That still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a better deal than selling to John for $12,000, as it requires less effort and is a faster transaction.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most profitable decision at this point."
