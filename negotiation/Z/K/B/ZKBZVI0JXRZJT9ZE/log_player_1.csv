Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to reiterate that I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I need to be within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his valuation, but we're still in early rounds.  It's worth seeing if we can push him a little higher before settling."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally moved off his initial offer, and while it's not the $1,400,000 we were hoping for, $1,250,000 is a reasonable gain over our minimum.  Continuing to push him risks him walking away altogether, leaving us with John's offer of $1,200,000.  Better to secure a solid profit now."
