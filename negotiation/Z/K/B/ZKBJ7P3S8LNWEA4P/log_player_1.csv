Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $1,150,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer matches what John is offering.  It's unlikely Bob will go any higher, and there's a risk of him walking away in future rounds. Accepting now secures a good price."
