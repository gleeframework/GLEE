Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $75.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $78 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $78 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $81.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $81. I'd be willing to pay $79 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $79 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Since I have the option to sell to John for $80, it's the safer choice. It's more likely I can get a better price in a later round with Bob, but I don't want to risk losing out on the $80 deal with John."
