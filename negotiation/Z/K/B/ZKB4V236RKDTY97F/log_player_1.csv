"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm also aware I can always go to John for $10,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to secure a deal with Bob.  This price is a significant increase from his offer but is still lower than my original asking price. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm recognizing that we're getting close to the middle ground.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's $10,000."
