Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum value for the product. I'm confident that I can get at least $100 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't accept a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to go lower than my initial price, but $90 is below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price, since it's closer to his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation. I'm confident that I can get $100 from John, which is my minimum acceptable price."
