Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value I place on the product.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a profit.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
