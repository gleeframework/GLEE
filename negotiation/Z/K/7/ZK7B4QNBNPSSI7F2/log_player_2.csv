Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $975,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our negotiation and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. It seems she's trying to pressure me with the other buyer, but I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
