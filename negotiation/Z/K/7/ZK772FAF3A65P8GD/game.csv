"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe that's a fair price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more appropriate. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
