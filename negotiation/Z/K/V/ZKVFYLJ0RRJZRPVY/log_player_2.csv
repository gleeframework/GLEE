"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject and counter-offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than your offer. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can meet in the middle. There are still rounds remaining, and it's possible to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,500,000, Bob. However, I was thinking that since you're so close to your maximum budget, I could offer you a slight discount. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,520,000. This is still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.  Since John is willing to sell the product at Bob's maximum budget, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
