Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the benefits you'll get from having it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
