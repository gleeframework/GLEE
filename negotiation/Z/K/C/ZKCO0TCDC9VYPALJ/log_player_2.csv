Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $875,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you at $925,000 again. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product with added value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice hasn't budged much on price, the added warranty and support package add value to the deal. At this point, the difference between Alice's offer and a potential best-case scenario with further negotiation is likely smaller than the value of the added benefits. Accepting now secures the product and those extras."
