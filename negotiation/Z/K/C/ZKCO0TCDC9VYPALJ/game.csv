"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from its true value.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $875,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $875,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can offer $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you at $925,000 again. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product with added value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
