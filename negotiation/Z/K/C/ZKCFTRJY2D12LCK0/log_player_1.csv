Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good deal considering the potential for further negotiations to fall apart.  It's also significantly higher than the offer from John, making it the best option at this stage."
