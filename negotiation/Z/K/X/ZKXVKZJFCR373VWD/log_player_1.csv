Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This offer won't last long, so what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Emphasize Value:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as exclusive, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially in your favor.

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net at $10,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but the potential gain from a higher price makes it a risk worth considering."
