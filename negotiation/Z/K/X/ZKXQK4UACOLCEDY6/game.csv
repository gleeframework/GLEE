"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be interested in buying the product at this price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really hoping to get this product for $90. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to do that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, which is $100. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
