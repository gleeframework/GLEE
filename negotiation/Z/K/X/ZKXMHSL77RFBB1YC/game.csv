"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm eager to reach an agreement. However, $962,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap one more time.  I'm willing to drop my price to $970,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial limitations.  Let's make this deal happen!",970000.0,Alice,5,
