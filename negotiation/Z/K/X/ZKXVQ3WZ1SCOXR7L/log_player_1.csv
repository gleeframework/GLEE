"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value will exceed your expectations.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see Bob's level of interest.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential for exceeding expectations can encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for discussion, inviting Bob to share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, but less than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is tempting, I need to remain within a certain range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the significant value of the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial price, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Middle Ground:** By suggesting a ""middle ground"" price, I'm framing it as a fair and reasonable solution.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to lower your price to $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer is the best outcome at this point. It allows me to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection.  Additionally, it saves time and avoids the potential of needing to sell to John, which would have resulted in the same price but potentially less desirable terms."
