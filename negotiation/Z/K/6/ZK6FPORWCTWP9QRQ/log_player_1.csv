Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $16,000 is above my budget.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $10,500.  This is the highest I'm able to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the savings it would bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting the sure thing of $12,000 from John makes more sense at this point than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
