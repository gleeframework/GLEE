"I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think it's a bit high at $10,000, but I'm still interested in making a deal. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that.",9500.0,Bob,4,
