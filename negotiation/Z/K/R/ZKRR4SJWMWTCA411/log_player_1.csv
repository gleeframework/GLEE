Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Strategy**

* **Leverage John:**  Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,000,000, guaranteeing her a profit. This information is powerful but should not be revealed to Bob.
* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,000,000 from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting too high might scare Bob away. A slightly lower starting point allows for counter-offers.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is confident and positions the product as high-value. 
* **Price:** $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even lower to allow for more back-and-forth.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be more flexible on price."
