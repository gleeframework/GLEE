"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, but need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. How about we try $107.50? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
