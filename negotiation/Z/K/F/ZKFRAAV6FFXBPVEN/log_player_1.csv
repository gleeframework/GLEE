Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's not too high:** It's still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $10,000.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a deal that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). While you're interested in selling to Bob, accepting his offer would result in a considerable loss for you. 

Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a more agreeable price or, if Bob doesn't budge, you can move on to John, who is willing to pay your minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  $9,500 is a compromise, offering a lower price than your initial offer while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes finding a fair price and meeting halfway, encouraging Bob to see the value in your counteroffer.
* **Opportunity to reach an agreement:** This counteroffer provides an opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable price without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still thinking $9,000 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $9,250 is just slightly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting this offer, you still have the option of trying to negotiate further with Bob in the future.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:** Selling to John would guarantee $10,000, but it's worth exploring whether you can secure a slightly higher price with Bob.

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal with Bob and potentially benefit from any future negotiations or a closer relationship."
