Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
