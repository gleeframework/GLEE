"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is at my absolute maximum budget.  I'm willing to offer $12000 for it, but I'm really hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14000 is closer, but I'm still stretched at that price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $13000.  This is my best offer, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $13000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
