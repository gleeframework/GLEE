"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $8,500? It's a good balance between our positions, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
