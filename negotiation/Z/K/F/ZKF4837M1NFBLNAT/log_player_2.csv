Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $8,500? It's a good balance between our positions, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at the desired price."
