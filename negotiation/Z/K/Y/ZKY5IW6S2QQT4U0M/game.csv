"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price closer to  $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective.  While that initial offer doesn't quite reflect the product's true value, I'm open to finding middle ground. How about we consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of what we're both bringing to the table.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could we possibly settle around $1,100,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I've tried to be flexible, but $1,100,000 falls significantly short of what I consider acceptable.  My final offer is $1,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you significant value. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
