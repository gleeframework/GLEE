Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $8,200 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,200 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,800, which still gives you a great deal. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 8800}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $8,400 is still too far below what I'm aiming for.  I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get closer to my target price of $9,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution here. I'm willing to come down to $8,600 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8600}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8400, but I need to be at or below that price. Can you consider that?

While I'm getting closer to my target price,  $8,400 is still too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  It's getting close to the end of the rounds, so I might have to concede a bit more, but I'm still hoping I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8300. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300

It's getting late in the game, and Bob's counteroffers are getting too close to my minimum price point.  I'm not sure I can get a better offer from him in the next round.  It's better to be safe and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
