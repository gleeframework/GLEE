Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is.  $100 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, and if she's willing to negotiate, it should open up the possibility of a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm splitting the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm serious about getting a deal, and hopefully, it will be a good enough compromise for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly in price, and we're very close to my target.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars,  at this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to ensure I get the product at a good price.  It's also important to consider that we're already halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn."
