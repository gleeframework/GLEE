"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely get a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1250000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1350000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation process open and allows him to potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.

Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still close to his target price of $1,200,000. While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially secures a lower price closer to his desired outcome."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make one final compromise, and I'll meet you at $1320000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his target price of $1,200,000, and with only three rounds left, he shouldn't give in too quickly.  Alice's offer is a slight improvement, but Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a price closer to his desired outcome."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm on your price, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $1290000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is only one round away from the deal falling apart, and Alice's offer is still too high. At this point, Bob should take the guaranteed price of $1,200,000 from John.  He has negotiated with Alice as much as possible and has reached the limit of what he is willing to spend.  

It's important for Bob to remember that his goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John ensures he achieves that goal."
