"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1350000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1325000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1300000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to make one final compromise, and I'll meet you at $1320000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm on your price, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to go up to $1275000, which is a significant compromise for me.  I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal, and I hope we can reach an agreement in the next round.",1275000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $1290000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1290000.0,Alice,9,
