Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $85, so how about $82.50? It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $82.50 and you have a guaranteed option for $80 from John.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
