Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice, along with the offer:

**Strategy:**

Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so she doesn't need to accept anything less from Bob. However, there's room to negotiate and potentially get more than $12,000. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer above Bob's perceived value but not ridiculously high. This leaves room for negotiation. 
2. **Highlight Value:** Frame the offer in a way that emphasizes the product's worth to Bob.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this [product name]. I know it would be incredibly valuable for your [mention how the product helps Bob], and I'm offering it at $13,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $13,500 is a starting point for negotiation. It's more than Alice's minimum and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if she comes down slightly.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's benefits for Bob, focusing on value rather than just the price.  

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Great! Alice gets more than her minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:**  This is expected. Alice can reduce the price slightly, aiming for something above $12,000.
* **Bob rejects:**  Alice moves on to John and sells for her guaranteed $12,000."
