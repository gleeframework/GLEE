"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
