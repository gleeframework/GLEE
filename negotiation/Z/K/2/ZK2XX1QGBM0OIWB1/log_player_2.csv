"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good return while still keeping me within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I believe a price closer to my original offer would be more reflective of that. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still within Bob's budget and is closer to his target price than John's offer of $15,000.  It's a good compromise, allowing Bob to save $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer and $3,000 compared to John's offer."
