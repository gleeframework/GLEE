"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good return while still keeping me within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I believe a price closer to my original offer would be more reflective of that. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
