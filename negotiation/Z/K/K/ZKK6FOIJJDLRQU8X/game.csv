"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $700000. This would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $825000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still slightly higher than my current budget. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for the product, which I believe reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. I'm willing to sell the product for $800000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $775000, which is a fair compromise considering the previous offers.  This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, but we need to find a mutually agreeable price.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $825000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a deal at $812500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",812500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, $812500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $790000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",790000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go below $825000.
