Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it at that price or lower would leave money on the table.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly.

**Why this approach?**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is significantly lower than your minimum and offers Bob a potential profit if he leverages the product effectively.
* **Profitable for Alice:**  The price is still significantly higher than John's offer, securing a substantial profit. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible deal from Bob."
