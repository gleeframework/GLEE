Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  It also keeps the possibility of selling to John open if Bob is unwilling to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob a chance to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to take a small loss, but I want to see if I can get a bit more before I sell to John."

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. This offer is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum. It's not ideal, but it's the safest option at this point."
