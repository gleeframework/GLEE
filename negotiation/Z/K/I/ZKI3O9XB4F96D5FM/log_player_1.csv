Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

We're still a good bit away from Bob's maximum perceived value. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,210,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
