"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, it's still a lot higher than the product's value to Alice ($100).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** The offer of $115 is only $5 away from Bob's counteroffer of $110.  
* **There's a risk of going higher:**  If Bob rejects again, Alice might counter with a price closer to $120, potentially pushing the price past Bob's comfort zone.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 10 rounds, it's better to secure a deal that's within budget rather than risk losing time and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
