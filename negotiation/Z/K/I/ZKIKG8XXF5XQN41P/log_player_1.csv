Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $75 is too low for me, considering my minimum value is $100. I'll counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still above my minimum value, but I'm also showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come up with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110.  This is a final attempt to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm  lowering my offer, but it's still above my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $100."
