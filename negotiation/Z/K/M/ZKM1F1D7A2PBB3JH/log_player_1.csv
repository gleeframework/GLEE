{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I know its value to you is high, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better.  $950,000 is not enough considering the product's value to him, and I have more rounds to negotiate. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  While $950,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a significant profit for me, and gives you a great deal on this valuable product.  Let's continue to work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's firm on $950,000, I'm not ready to settle for that yet. I'm still hoping to get a higher price, and I have several rounds left to negotiate.  Selling to John is a last resort, and I'd rather see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $1,050,000.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant commitment from me, and I believe it's a fair price for the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get him to go higher. Selling to John is still a last resort, and I'm not ready to settle for that yet."
