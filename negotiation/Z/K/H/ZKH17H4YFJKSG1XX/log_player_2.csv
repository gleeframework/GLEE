"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially get a better deal. Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to bring the price down. There's a possibility she might be willing to accept a lower offer to avoid losing the deal entirely."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still slightly higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely still negotiate further, as Alice has indicated she has another buyer.  You have a solid alternative in John, so you can afford to be more aggressive in your negotiations."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
