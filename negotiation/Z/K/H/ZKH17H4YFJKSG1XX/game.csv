"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, as I'm aiming to stay within a specific budget.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price.  Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
