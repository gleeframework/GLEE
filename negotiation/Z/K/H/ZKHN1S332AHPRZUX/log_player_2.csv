# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1200000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1250000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, it's getting closer!  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price again. There's a chance you can secure the product for slightly less than what John is offering, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still slightly above my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal if you're willing to come down to $1,225,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1225000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $1240000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,240,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,240,000 is still above your budget of $1,200,000.  While you could continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Alice will ultimately agree to your price. 

Since John is offering the product for $1,200,000, it's the most financially sound decision to buy from him. You save money and avoid the potential for further negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
