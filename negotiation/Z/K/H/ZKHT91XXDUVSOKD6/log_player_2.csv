"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, considering the significant value this product holds for you. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a good price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($10,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially reaching a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable value, saving him more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? I'm really interested in your product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about considering a price of $11,500 for the product? This still offers a great value while accommodating your financial needs. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away.  

At this price, Bob is getting the product for $1,500 less than what John is offering, which is a significant savings.  

It's a good deal for Bob, and the risk of continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential benefit."
