"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try and push for a bit more.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price slightly above Bob's offer.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum, and I'm getting a bit worried about running out of rounds. Accepting his offer will secure me a sale and a slightly better price than John would offer."
