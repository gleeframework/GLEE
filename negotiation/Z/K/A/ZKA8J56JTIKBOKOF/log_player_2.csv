"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to me ($100), it's still a bit high. I want to try and negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's value of $80 but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice and see if I can get her closer to $85. I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to get a better deal. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than what Alice is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but I'm also trying to show flexibility by offering a price in the middle ground between our previous offers. This demonstrates that I'm still interested in buying the product but also that I'm willing to be reasonable."
