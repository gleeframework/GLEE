"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob bites, but I'm prepared to negotiate.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer and try to squeeze a little more out of this negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm not sure how much more I can squeeze out of him. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure this profit than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
