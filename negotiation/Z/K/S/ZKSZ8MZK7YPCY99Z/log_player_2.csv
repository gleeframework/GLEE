"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get a better price by negotiating further.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, Bob has room to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $9,000, but still above Alice's minimum price of $8,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There's still potential to negotiate further and get a better deal, especially since Alice has already shown flexibility by reducing her initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,750. This shows he's willing to compromise, but is still pushing for a price closer to his target. He's hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now asking for $9,400, which is higher than her previous offer and closer to John's price.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and it seems like Alice is not willing to budge much further.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the most sensible option at this point, as continuing to negotiate with Alice risks ending up with a worse deal, or taking up more time."
