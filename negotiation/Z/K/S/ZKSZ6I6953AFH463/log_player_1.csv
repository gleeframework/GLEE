Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great deal for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to entice Bob and justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Market Dynamics:** This strategy assumes you have some time before needing to accept John's offer. If you're on a tight deadline, you might offer a lower price to ensure a sale."
