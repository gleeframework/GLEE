"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the value it will bring to your business. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision as soon as possible. If you decide not to purchase, I have a backup offer for $1,200,000, but I'd rather see this go to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since you have the option to buy from John, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy.  You can then negotiate with Alice further or wait for a better offer."
