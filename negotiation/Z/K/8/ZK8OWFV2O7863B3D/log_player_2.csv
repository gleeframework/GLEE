"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is enthusiastic, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay.  There's no benefit to accepting immediately. By rejecting the offer, you signal that the price is too high and open the possibility of a counteroffer from Alice at a lower price.  Worst case, you can still buy from John at the same price."
