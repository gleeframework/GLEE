"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
