"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it's a great deal for that price, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than John's $120, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* Accepting at $110 still saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John.
* Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will walk away or refuse to budge further.  
* It's a good compromise that gets Bob the product at a decent price."
