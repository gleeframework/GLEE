# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, so this is a great deal. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

* **You save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $1,500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice's perceived value is irrelevant:**  While Alice believes the product is worth more to you, your goal is to get the best deal for yourself, regardless of her perception."
