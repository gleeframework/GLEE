"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected.  This is a common negotiation tactic to establish a high starting point and leave room for compromise.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, my starting point leaves a large gap for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm also considering selling to John for $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that number with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving significant room for negotiation. This demonstrates flexibility while also indicating that I'm not willing to drop to Bob's offer just yet. I'm aiming for a compromise somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I am still within my desired range with John's offer and would like to see if I can push Bob further before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still aiming for a number that is closer to my ideal price point.  I believe this offer is reasonable given Bob's previous offers and my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to a compromise this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired range.  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and with limited rounds remaining, I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  

John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher and guarantees me a better return.  Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
