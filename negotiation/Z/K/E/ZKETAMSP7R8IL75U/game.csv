"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
