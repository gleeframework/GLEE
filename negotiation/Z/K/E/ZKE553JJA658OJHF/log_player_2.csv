"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is quite close to her own valuation of the product. There's a lot of room for negotiation here. I'll reject this offer and propose a counter offer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the opening offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more realistic.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 
This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000, which is closer to my minimum threshold. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering the product at the same price John is offering.  There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal. I'll accept her offer."
