Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment I've made in it.  Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I could make a firm offer at $750,000. This is a fair price considering the market and the value it brings to my business."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $750,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000,  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her original price and has stated this is her final offer.  While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely to be enough to make it worthwhile for you. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving you time and potential further negotiation."
