"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,800? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it a great value.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800, but I'm still a bit high.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,600.  This price works for my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10600.0,Bob,4,
