"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more than that to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum price point of $10,000.
* This is a strategic move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* If she rejects this offer, I'll have more information to work with in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,800? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $10,800 is closer to my maximum budget of $12,000, it's still higher than my ideal price. 
* I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer to see if I can bring the price down further.
* There are still many rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800, but I'm still a bit high.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,600.  This price works for my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm still aiming to get the product for as low a price as possible.
* By offering $10,600, I'm showing Alice I'm serious about buying and am willing to compromise. 
* This offer is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, which should encourage her to accept."
