{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since her offer is below your maximum price.  Let's see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

Let's start by offering $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and should hopefully encourage her to negotiate."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but $115 is still a bit high. Let's try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

We'll meet Alice halfway with $110. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $112.5 is a good compromise.  We've already made several counteroffers and the difference between our price and hers is getting smaller.  Accepting this offer will save us money compared to buying from John."
