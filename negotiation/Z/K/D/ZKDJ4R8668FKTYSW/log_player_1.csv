"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm curious to see if Bob is interested at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $120, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $135. It's a compromise that's still above my minimum price, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is a final compromise, aiming for a price in the middle of our current positions. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm at his price.  Although I'd like to get a little more, I'm going to sell to John.  There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale."
