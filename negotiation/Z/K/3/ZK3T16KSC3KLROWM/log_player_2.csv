Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $6,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $7,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.

While Alice is coming down, $7,500 is still higher than John's $8,000 offer. We have room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $7,200? It's a small increase, but it's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $7,200 is too close to John's $8,000 offer.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potential savings of only $800."
