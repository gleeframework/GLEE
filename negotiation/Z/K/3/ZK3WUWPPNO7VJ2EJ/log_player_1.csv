Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

My reasoning:

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than if you started at $100.
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""special price"", I'm creating a sense of urgency and value, subtly suggesting the price might be non-negotiable. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  While I start high, the offer isn't ridiculously above Bob's perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll counter instead of walking away, giving me more information to work with.

I am aware Bob might reject this initial offer. However, it gives me the best starting point to gauge his interest and potentially work towards a price closer to my desired minimum. If his counteroffers are too low, I always have the option to sell to John for my guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further since there's a chance I can get closer to $100.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that meets somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express willingness to negotiate, fostering goodwill. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $105, I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between his offer ($90) and my initial ask ($120). This makes it seem like a fair deal.
* **Staying Firm:** I am not going below my $100 minimum. While I'm aiming for a higher price, if Bob accepts $105, it's a good profit above my baseline.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm still open to selling to John for $100 if Bob continues to lowball or the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk:

* **Stalemate:**  He might dig in his heels, and we could reach an impasse. 
* **Losing the Sale:** Bob might walk away entirely if I push too hard. 

It's better to accept a slightly lower price ($95) that guarantees a profit than risk losing the sale altogether and only getting $100 from John."
