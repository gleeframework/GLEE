Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for Alice while still being attractive to Bob, as the product is worth $12,000 to him. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is less than the initial offer, it's still a profitable deal for Alice and closer to her desired price than selling to John. It also indicates Bob's willingness to negotiate, so pushing for a higher price might risk losing the sale entirely."
