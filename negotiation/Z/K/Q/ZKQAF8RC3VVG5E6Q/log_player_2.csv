"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is too close to Bob's maximum price point of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down significantly. He's starting with a counteroffer that's $1,000 below Alice's initial price. This is a significant drop, but still leaves room for negotiation. He's also being polite and acknowledging Alice's enthusiasm for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that, especially given the benefits it will bring you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, he's still aiming to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $8,500. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's also demonstrating that he's not willing to budge much further. He's hoping that Alice will recognize the value of getting a deal done and accept his offer."
