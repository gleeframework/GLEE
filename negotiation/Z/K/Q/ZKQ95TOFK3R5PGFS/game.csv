"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, my initial asking price reflects the unique features and potential this product offers, which I believe justifies a higher investment.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I think this represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
