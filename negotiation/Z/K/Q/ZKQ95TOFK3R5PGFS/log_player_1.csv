"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing the details further."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a very high price ($2,300,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, it gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a brief, positive justification for the high price without revealing specific details. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Openness to Discussion:** I emphasize my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. After evaluating the value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for a fair negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for further negotiation. While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I stand to gain a potentially much higher profit by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, my initial asking price reflects the unique features and potential this product offers, which I believe justifies a higher investment.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I think this represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective, showing I'm listening and taking his input seriously.
* **Reiterate Value:** I subtly re-emphasize the product's unique value and potential, justifying the higher price.
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):** I drop the price by $400,000, a significant amount designed to show flexibility and encourage Bob. However, I maintain a price point well above both his offer and my minimum. 
* **Framing:**  I frame the offer as a ""concession"" on my part, implying that Bob is getting a favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that is fair for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk that Bob might significantly lower his offer or walk away in future rounds. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
