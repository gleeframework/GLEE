{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value.**  This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's above your minimum value.**  This ensures you still make a substantial profit.

By starting at $1,200,000, you leave space for negotiation and increase the chances of reaching an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. Would you consider lowering the price to $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still in a good negotiating position.  Bob clearly sees the value of the product and has already indicated his willingness to compromise.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to push for a price closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business and represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $1125000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still respecting my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,150,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away completely.  Given that this price is still well above my minimum value of $800,000 and that it's likely the best I can get, I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
