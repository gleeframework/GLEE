"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1000000.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $975000, but I'd like to propose a trade-off: I'll pay the full $975000, but I'd like a 2-year warranty on the product. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000. However, I'm not comfortable with the warranty request.
