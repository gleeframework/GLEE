"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,150,000 by continuing the negotiation.  There's a chance Alice will accept a lower counteroffer.  The worst-case scenario is that Bob ends up buying from John for $1,200,000, which is still within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This signals that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. The counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. This approach maximizes Bob's potential savings while still keeping the deal within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge again, and the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is too high. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $100,000 compared to buying from John."
