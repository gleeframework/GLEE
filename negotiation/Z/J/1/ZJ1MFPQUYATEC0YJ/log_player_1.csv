Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $160 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $170?  I think that's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 170}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $1 less than my last offer and getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  Plus, we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
