Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,999000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $999000 is outside of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $999000 is out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is my final offer, as that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
