"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that exact price, you have no incentive to accept immediately.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or see if other sellers offer a better deal."
