"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its market value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000.
