{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Strong but Fair:** This price point aims to secure a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.

By starting at $14,000, you increase your chances of securing a higher sale price than your guaranteed $12,000 from John."
