"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now offered the same price as John. Bob is indifferent between buying from Alice or John at this point.  However, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking a further stalemate or a potential price increase from Alice."
