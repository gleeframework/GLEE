{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The goal is to save money and get the product for as close to $150 as possible.  Alice's offer of $180 is too high. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it gives us room to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is a reasonable compromise. It's only $5 more than my maximum price, and I'm willing to pay a little extra to avoid the risk of further negotiations. There's a chance she could lower her price further, but the possibility of a deal falling apart is too high.  I'll take this offer and get the product."
