"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value Bob places on the product ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's exactly my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get a little bit more, but I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $13,000? "", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of your product and my budget, I would like to propose $12,500 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer, and it's a fair deal considering the value of the product to both of us. It's also worth noting that we are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
