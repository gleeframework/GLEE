"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15000 is your maximum budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $16500 for the product. This is my final offer.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",17500.0,Alice,5,
