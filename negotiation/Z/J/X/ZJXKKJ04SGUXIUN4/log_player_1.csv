"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This allows for some wiggle room for negotiation, but reflects the product's true value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit above my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It is worth more to me to keep negotiating with Bob than to sell to John.  However, I need to make a counteroffer to ensure I can get a better price than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, at $850,000, we're still significantly below the value of this product for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to find a price that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'd like to offer $875000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's tempting to sell to John now, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's worth a few more rounds to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While $875,000 is closer, we still need to ensure the price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 890000}
