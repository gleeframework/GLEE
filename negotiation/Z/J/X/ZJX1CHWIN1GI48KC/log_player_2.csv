"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  How about $14,000?  That's the absolute highest I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $16000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $15500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $15,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He has several rounds left and can still try to negotiate a lower price.  At this point, there's no reason to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $15,500 is still a little out of my range, but I'm prepared to go to $14,500.  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go to $14500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $14750 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,750 is closer, but I'm still going to have to stick with my last offer of $14,500.  It's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $14625 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He has reached the final round of negotiations with Alice, and while $14,625 is close to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $10,000."
