"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000).**  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a better alternative with John at $1,500,000.**  While John's price is higher than Alice's, it's still within your budget.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or buy from John.**

By rejecting, you're signaling to Alice that you're not desperate and have other options, which could lead to a better deal."
