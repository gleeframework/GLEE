"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above the midpoint between my minimum ($80) and Bob's maximum value ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to accept. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal. 

This offer is a good starting point. I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary, but I'm not giving it away for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price.  Bob has shown interest, and I'm confident I can negotiate him up a bit more. 

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm counter-offering with a price closer to my desired range while still being reasonable. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Compromise:**  Highlighting the ""split the difference"" approach makes the offer seem fair and attractive.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him. 

I believe this counteroffer is strong enough to entice Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. It's getting closer to my desired range, but I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can continue to negotiate with Bob and find a more agreeable price.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about we settle on $100?  I'm really hoping to finalize this sale with you, and I think this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** I'm persisting with my negotiations, showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Compromise Again:** I'm offering a price halfway between our previous two offers, showing flexibility.
* **Appeal to Shared Goals:** I'm emphasizing the desire to finalize the sale with him, suggesting a mutual benefit. 

This counteroffer is a strong middle ground, likely appealing to Bob's desire to close the deal while still offering me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. We're only a few dollars apart, and I believe I can get Bob to budge a little more.  Selling to John for $80 is a last resort, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $97.50?  It's a small compromise on my part, but I really want to close this deal with you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility and willingness to close the deal.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm closing the gap between our offers, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like we're working together to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer is a strong final push, likely leading to a successful agreement with Bob before I need to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my budget. How about we meet at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the wire with only two rounds left.  Bob's offer is still below my desired range, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a deadlock. 

While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  I don't want to risk losing out entirely. Selling to John for $80 guarantees a sale and prevents me from potentially getting nothing if I continue to negotiate with Bob. 

This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale within the limited time frame."
