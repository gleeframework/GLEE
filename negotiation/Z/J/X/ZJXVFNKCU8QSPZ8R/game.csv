"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move the product while still making a reasonable profit. ",13500.0,Alice,3,
