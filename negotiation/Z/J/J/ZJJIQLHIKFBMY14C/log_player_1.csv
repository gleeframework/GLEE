{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for a possible compromise. By giving a reason (value to Bob) and a positive tone, I aim to make Bob feel valued and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but my budget is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $9,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little and meet you halfway at $8,750. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $8750 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8250. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. While it's tempting to accept and avoid the risk of him walking away, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the need to sell.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
