"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to both of us, and Alice is offering it for $110, it's a good starting point, but I can likely get it for even cheaper. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $102.50. I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $102.50 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $108. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit more, but her offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject and see if we can get closer to a price that works for both of us.  We have time left in the negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your last offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $109. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, it's still not a good enough deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a lower price. It's better to keep pushing for a better deal rather than accepting this offer, as I have time left and might get a better price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you sticking with this negotiation. While $109 is closer, I'm still hoping for something lower. I'm willing to go up to $106.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round of negotiation with Alice. While I'd prefer to get it for lower, $110 is still a good price considering the product's worth to me. It's much better than buying from John for $120, and the negotiation has been a long process. I'll accept Alice's offer and conclude the deal."
