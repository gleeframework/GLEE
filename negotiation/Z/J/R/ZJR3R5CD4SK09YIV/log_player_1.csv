Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,500,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the price John is offering. Can you do any better than that?

Bob is now attempting to lowball me and clearly knows John's offer. There's no guarantee he'll go any higher, and I'm not willing to risk getting less than my minimum.  It's time to move on to John."
