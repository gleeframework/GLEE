Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not convinced it's worth the full $1500000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000, which is a significant reduction from the original price. I'm open to further discussion and willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be confident that the product is a good investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
