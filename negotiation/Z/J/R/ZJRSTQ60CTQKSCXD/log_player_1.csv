``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate. However, it's still within a reasonable range to encourage him to counteroffer.  If Bob rejects, you'll be ready to counter his offer or walk away to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me.  I've reached my limit for negotiating with Bob. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
