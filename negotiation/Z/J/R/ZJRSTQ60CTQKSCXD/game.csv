"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $13500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $14250.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go above $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about we meet at $13750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
