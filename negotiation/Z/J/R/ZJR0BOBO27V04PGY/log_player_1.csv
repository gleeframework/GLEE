"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, but also ensures I'm maximizing my potential profit.  I'm confident that the product is worth at least that much to me, so this offer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a higher price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  There's still room for compromise, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $13,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that I feel is fair, given the value of the product to me and the potential for Bob to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my preferred price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not yet ready to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I'm hoping this offer is high enough to entice Bob, but still ensures I get a decent profit.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John if this offer fails, so I need to be strategic about how I approach this next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for my comfort level.  While I'd love to get a higher price, I don't want to risk a further decrease in his offers or run out of rounds.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's time to cut my losses and move on."
