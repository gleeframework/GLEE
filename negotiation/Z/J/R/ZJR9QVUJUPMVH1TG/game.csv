"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. That would work best for my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  However, there's a significant gap between $1,100,000 and my minimum. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to make one more move down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer; let me know if it works for you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other interested buyers, but that price is still a stretch for me.  If you're willing to meet me at $1,250,000, we have a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
