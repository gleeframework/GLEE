Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the price confidently, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

By setting the initial offer high, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than her fallback option with John."
