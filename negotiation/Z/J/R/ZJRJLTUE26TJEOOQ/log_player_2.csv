Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $900,000 is close, but to be fair, I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this.  That's my final offer.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice seems to be very reluctant to go below $1,100,000.  It's not worth further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 with John."
