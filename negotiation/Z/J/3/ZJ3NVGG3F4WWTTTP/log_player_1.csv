Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a good profit for me and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than John's offer. Since I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob in the next round, it's safer to accept his offer and secure the sale."
