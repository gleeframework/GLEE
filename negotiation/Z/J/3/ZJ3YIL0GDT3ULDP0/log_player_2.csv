# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $9,500.  Reject and see if Alice will come down.  You have a lot of room to negotiate before reaching John's price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good price for you and still allows you to save money compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, so accept it."
