"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but you want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects its potential value to me while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,375,000 is closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay at this moment. By rejecting, you can try to push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
