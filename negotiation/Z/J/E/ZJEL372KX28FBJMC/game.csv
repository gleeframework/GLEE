"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects its potential value to me while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
