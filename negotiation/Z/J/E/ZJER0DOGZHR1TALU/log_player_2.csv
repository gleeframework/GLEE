"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000, making it the financially advantageous choice."
