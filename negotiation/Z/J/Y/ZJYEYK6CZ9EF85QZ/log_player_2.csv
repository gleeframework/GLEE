"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's original asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, given the high quality and unique features of the product, I am unable to lower the price below $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has firmly stated she won't go lower than $12,000, which is still outside Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget, even if it means missing out on potentially unique features offered by Alice's product."
