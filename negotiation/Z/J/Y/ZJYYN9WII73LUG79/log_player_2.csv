"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its true worth. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can get the product from John for a lower price, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
