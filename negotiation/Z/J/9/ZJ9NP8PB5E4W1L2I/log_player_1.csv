{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's inherent worth and the potential for significant future benefits. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen a starting price of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I've included a friendly and persuasive message highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob. This is crucial to establishing a positive tone and encouraging him to consider my offer seriously.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** This offer gives me a good chance of earning a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  The $1,100,000 price leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. I can then adjust my price based on his response and our ongoing discussions.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal altogether."
