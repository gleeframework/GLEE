"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it sold.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm still making a concession to get it sold.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle somewhere around $7,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,200. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm still making a concession to get it sold.",8200.0,Alice,5,
