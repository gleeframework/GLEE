Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm still making a concession to get it sold.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,200. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm still making a concession to get it sold. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at this point."
