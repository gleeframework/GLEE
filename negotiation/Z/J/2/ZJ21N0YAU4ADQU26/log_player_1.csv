Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy for $150 provides a safety net. There's no need to go below that price."
