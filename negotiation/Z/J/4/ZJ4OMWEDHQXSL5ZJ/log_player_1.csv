I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still exceeding my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm confident in the value of my product and hope Bob will see its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a step down from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves me with a decent amount of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is still a good price for me. I've negotiated as much as I can at this point, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go any higher.  I'm willing to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
