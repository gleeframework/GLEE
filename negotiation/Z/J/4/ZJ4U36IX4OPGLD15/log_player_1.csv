The product is worth at least $100 to me, and Bob's offer is the minimum. I'm not in a rush, so I'll try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3

Round 4

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell for less than $100. I'll try to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and with only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking the deal. I'll sell to John for $100, which is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price."
