"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You'll pay $950,000, which is less than the $1,000,000 you'd pay John. 
* **Your goal is to save money:**  Even though you could get the product cheaper from Alice, your goal is to save as much money as possible, making accepting her offer the best option."
