{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, 25% lower than Alice's original price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but still within my budget. This should encourage Alice to consider my offer, and hopefully we can settle somewhere in between."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This amount is still within my budget and hopefully close enough to Alice's offer that she will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a lot in price, but it's still above my budget.  I'm now at a point where I am only willing to pay $1,000,000. Since I know John is willing to sell for that price, it's time to cut my losses and buy from him.  The risk of continuing with Alice is too high as she may not accept my next offer."
