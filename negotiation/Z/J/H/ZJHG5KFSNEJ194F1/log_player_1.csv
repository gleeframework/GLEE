{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by expressing my confidence in the product's appeal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $12,000 is a little below what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could counteroffer, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. It's best to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
