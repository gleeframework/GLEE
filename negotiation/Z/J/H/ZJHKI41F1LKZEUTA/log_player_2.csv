"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. While I can't disclose the exact details right now, I assure you it's worth significantly more than $8000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $10,000, which is your maximum budget. While she claims the product is worth more than $8,000, this information is unreliable and likely just a tactic to pressure you into accepting. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price, so there's no reason to take a risk on an unknown product."
