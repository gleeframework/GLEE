"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950000 is a bit out of my range right now.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a significant amount and reflects my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to maintain a higher price point to ensure the product's value is reflected. Considering our previous offer and counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $875000 is closer, it's still above my current comfort zone.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850000.  This is a fair and reasonable price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the product's value. Considering our previous offers and counteroffers, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $875000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a premium warranty and a personalized consultation session. This package is worth $25000, so I'm effectively offering the product to you for $850000. This is a unique opportunity for you to own this product and get additional value on top of the purchase price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
