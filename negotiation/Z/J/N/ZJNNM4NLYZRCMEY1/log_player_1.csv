Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think it could be highly valuable for you. I'm offering it at a special price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you could still settle for a price higher than your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A price ending in ""999"" might be more appealing than a round number.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $8,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he sees the product as unique or essential.
* **Alternative Buyers:** If you had more time or were unsure about John's offer, you might negotiate with Bob for longer or explore other potential buyers."
