"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15000 to me, but considering its value to you is $12000, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair deal. How about $13500?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, after careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product at $12600. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,600 is only $600 above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there are only a few rounds left. Given the risk of Alice potentially walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice."
