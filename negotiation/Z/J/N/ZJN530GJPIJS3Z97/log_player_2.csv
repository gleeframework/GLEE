"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is significantly less than $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though Alice is selling the product for a profit, the price is still within your budget and lower than what you'd pay John."
