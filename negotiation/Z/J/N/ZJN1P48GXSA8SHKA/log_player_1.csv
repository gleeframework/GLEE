"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I need to ask for a bit more to make this work for me. How about $11,500?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer. Would $10,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a lack of willingness to budge on his offer.  While I'd prefer to get more, I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation, and selling to John for $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal."
