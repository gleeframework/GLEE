"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $92.50 is a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. That's a fair price for us both, considering your value for the product.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.",90.0,Alice,5,
