"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12,000. Would you be able to lower the price to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair price given the value I'm offering.  Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,5,
