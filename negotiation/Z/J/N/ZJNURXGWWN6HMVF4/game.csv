"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000.

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $16500. I'll sell the product to you for $16750. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it!",16750.0,Alice,7,
