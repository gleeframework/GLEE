"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is more than your maximum budget. 
* **Counteroffers are possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This gives you a fallback position if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for some profit for you. I'm open to discussing further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, signaling your willingness to negotiate but also establishing a clear starting point.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the offer â€“ the value to Bob and Alice's potential profit. This makes the counteroffer feel more reasonable.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message emphasizes willingness to discuss further, leaving room for compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and still allows for a significant profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget.
* **There's room for more negotiation.**  You have more rounds, and Alice is willing to compromise, suggesting further negotiation could lead to a more favorable price.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** It's always a fallback in case you can't reach an acceptable price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows you a significant profit. This is a sincere offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  This counteroffer only increases slightly from the previous offer, showing you're serious about getting a deal but also highlighting that you have a clear budget limit.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** The message again emphasizes a ""fair price"" and points out Alice's potential profit. This reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message mentions ""hoping to reach an agreement this round"" subtly adds a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and still allows for a decent profit for me. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget.
* **Potential for a better deal.** You have 5 more rounds to negotiate. With continued persistence and a bit more compromise from Alice, you might be able to secure the product for a lower price.
* **John remains a fallback option.** Even if negotiations with Alice fail, you have the option to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal this round."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
