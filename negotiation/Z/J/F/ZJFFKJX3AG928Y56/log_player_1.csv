Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no need to go lower.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below $15,000 allows room for Bob to counter-offer. It gives the impression of flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

By offering the product at $14,999, I'm maximizing my chances of securing the highest possible profit."
