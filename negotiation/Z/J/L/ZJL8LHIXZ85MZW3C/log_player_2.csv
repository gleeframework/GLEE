Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about we try $11,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $10,500? It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could likely negotiate a slightly lower price, accepting $10,500 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** We're buying the product for $4,500 less than John's price and $1,500 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time, and there's no guarantee Alice will go much lower. Accepting now secures the deal. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** This price point reflects a fair compromise, with both parties moving from their initial positions."
