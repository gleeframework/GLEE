"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",10500.0,Alice,3,
