Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Being friendly and open:**  I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing my willingness to negotiate. This can help build rapport and make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By offering a price higher than my minimum, I create space for Bob to negotiate and hopefully arrive at a price we both find acceptable. 
* **Knowing my fallback:** If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $80, so there's no pressure to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No benefit to further negotiation:** There's no point in rejecting his offer and counter-offering, as I'm already at my lowest price.  
* **No risk of losing the sale:**  Even though John is also willing to pay $80, I'm not losing anything by accepting Bob's offer.

It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize my earnings, and in this case, accepting Bob's offer achieves that goal."
