"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $15,000, which is Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $12500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $13750?  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
