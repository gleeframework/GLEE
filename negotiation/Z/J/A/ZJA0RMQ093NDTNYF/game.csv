"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12500. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $12500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $13750?  Let's make this happen.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13750 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $13125.  I'm serious about getting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13125.0,Bob,4,
