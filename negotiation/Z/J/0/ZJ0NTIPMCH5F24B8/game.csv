"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider this price?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $20. If you're interested, I'll sell the product to you for $110, but you'll get the extra service package included. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which is $107.50. I'll throw in the premium service package again, and we can call it a deal. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,7,

"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $106, but I'll only do it if you're willing to commit to purchasing the product today.
