Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value to me. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given your value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
