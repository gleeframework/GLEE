"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1800000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1900000. This price still reflects the value and potential of this product, while also allowing for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1750000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from this product. Can you consider my revised offer?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. While $1750000 is closer, it's still below what I need to consider. I'm willing to go down to $1850000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to move forward with this exciting opportunity. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $1800000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Can you consider this revised price?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
