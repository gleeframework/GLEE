It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $10,000.  You can get the same product from John for $8,000.  Reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a price that's halfway between what I'm willing to pay and what Alice is hoping to get. This gives us room to negotiate, but also shows that I'm serious about buying the product."

Alice is still above my maximum price, even with the slightly lowered offer. I will reject her offer and continue to negotiate."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm still interested in buying from Alice.  But I'm also keeping it below her asking price, hoping to find a compromise."
