You can definitely do better than $12,000. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical step to try and save more money."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it gives us room to negotiate. It's also a price that is still well within my budget."

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate further.  I'm willing to go higher than $10,500 but still need to save money."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to accept."

Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to my maximum, and I don't want to risk going back and forth for much longer. While it would be great to get the product for even less, I'm confident that I can buy it for $15,000 from John."
