"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Could you do $15,000? That feels like a fairer compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
