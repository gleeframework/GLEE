"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm looking to save some money, but I still think the product could be valuable to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your perspective, $700000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to come down to $850000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still represents a good deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
