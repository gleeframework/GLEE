"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a much higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will guide my next move.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on that deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While his offer suggests he's very interested, I need to steer the negotiation towards a more reasonable range.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I'm lowering my initial price by a significant amount, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Strong:** However, I'm not getting too close to his offer yet.  My new price is still above both our perceived values, leaving room for further negotiation but in a range more favorable to me.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying firm above his offer, I'm emphasizing the value of the product and aiming to move him closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a compromise here.  While the product is good, $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:** Bob has increased his offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leveraging Time:** We still have several rounds left in the negotiation, and I'm willing to use that time to see if I can push Bob closer to my target.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that selling to John at $1,500,000 is still a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob stall significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price.  Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,850,000? This reflects the product's real value while recognizing your willingness to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm significantly reducing my price from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob closer to the middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer of $1,850,000 is:
    * Still comfortably above both my minimum and John's offer, protecting my profit potential.
    * A substantial increase from Bob's last offer, encouraging him to keep moving upwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly and increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I can do $1,350,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my fallback option of selling to John. While $1,350,000 is a decent profit, I believe there's still potential to push for more.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  His language (""getting closer to my limit"") suggests he might be reaching his maximum.  However, this could be a negotiation tactic. I'll make one more strong counteroffer to test his true willingness to pay. 
* **Time Remaining:** I still have a few rounds left, so I can afford to take a calculated risk in hopes of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price. Let's make this happen - $1,700,000, and we have a deal. This offer reflects the true value of the product and represents my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to signal the seriousness of the situation and push Bob towards a decision.
* **Strategic Reduction:** The price reduction is smaller this time, reinforcing the idea that I'm nearing my bottom line. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and counter Bob's potential pushback.
* **Preparedness:**  I'm mentally prepared to walk away and take John's offer if Bob rejects this. It's a strong offer, and holding out for a potentially insignificant increase isn't worth the risk at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a way to make this work.  I can offer $1,425,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's counteroffer after my ""final offer"" is a strong signal that we've reached an impasse.  His increase is minimal, and he's now focusing on his budget constraints.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more from Bob, it's unlikely to be a significant difference at this point. 
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John ensures a solid profit without further risk or time investment. It's the most logical decision in this situation."
