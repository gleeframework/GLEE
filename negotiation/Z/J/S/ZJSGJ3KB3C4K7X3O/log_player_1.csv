Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the market. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency and value. It's significantly less than my fallback option but still a substantial profit. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in the discussion. 

By starting high, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming to secure a price that's significantly beneficial for me."
