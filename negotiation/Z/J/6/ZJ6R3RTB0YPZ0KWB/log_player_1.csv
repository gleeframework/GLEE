Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I know it's worth a significant investment to the right buyer. I'm asking for $2,000,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While the product is worth $1,500,000 to both of you, framing it as ""incredibly valuable"" and a ""significant investment"" might nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Round Number:** Using a round number like $2,000,000 makes it appear more deliberate and potentially more palatable than a less rounded figure. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you might have about Bob (his risk tolerance, negotiation tactics, etc.), you could adjust your offer."
