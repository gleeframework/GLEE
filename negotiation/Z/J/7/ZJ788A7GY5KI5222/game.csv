"Bob, I understand your budget, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
