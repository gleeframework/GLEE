(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The offer is too high.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my best offer.  I'm confident the product is worth this much to Alice, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with the price. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and is a fair compromise considering Alice's price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While this offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable paying over $14,000. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if I can push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is a fair compromise considering Alice's last offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I may have to consider purchasing from John instead."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. Although we've made some progress, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement within our remaining rounds.  It's better to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiation."
