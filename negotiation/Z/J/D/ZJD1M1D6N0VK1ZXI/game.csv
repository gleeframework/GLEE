"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit surprised by the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, I believe the product's inherent value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
