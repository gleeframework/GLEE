Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000.  Luckily, you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 if you can sell to Bob for a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is attractive to Bob while still maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I've done my research, and I know it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Acknowledging the product's value to Bob's business builds rapport.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still being below Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though you have a guaranteed sale) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you might adjust the price slightly. However, starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed."
