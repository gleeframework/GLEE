"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. I can go up to $6,500. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while recognizing your need for a fair deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $6,500 is still quite far from what I need. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,5,
