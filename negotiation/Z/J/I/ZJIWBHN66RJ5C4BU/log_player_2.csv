Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $6,500 is still quite far from what I need. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that beats John's offer. It's better to secure the $8,000 deal with John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
