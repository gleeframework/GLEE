"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $80, you're not saving any money by buying from her.  You might as well reject her offer and buy from John for the same price."
