{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum.  This leaves room for some negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $10,500.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. If you're serious about buying, let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 11000}
