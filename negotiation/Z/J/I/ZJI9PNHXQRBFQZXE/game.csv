"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $10,500.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. If you're serious about buying, let's try to bridge the gap.",11000.0,Alice,3,
