"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob is serious about buying.  I'm confident that I can secure a price closer to my target with a good negotiating strategy, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and push the price higher. I believe I can get closer to my target value if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges his willingness to pay a significant amount, but it also maintains a respectable profit for me.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I would prefer to secure a higher amount, I'm aware that the negotiation process can be unpredictable. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit that exceeds my minimum value, and it minimizes the risk of further negotiation rounds where Bob might lower his offer even more, or I might be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
