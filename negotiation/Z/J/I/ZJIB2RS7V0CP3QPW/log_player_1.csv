Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also allows me to see how much Bob values the product and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's a price point he'll be willing to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is higher than John's offer and is close enough to my ideal price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale entirely."
