"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to make this deal work.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering my budget and the current market conditions, $1750000 is still beyond my reach. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I believe this offers a fair compromise while respecting the value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
