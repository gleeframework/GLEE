"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting significantly above both your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000), we create room for negotiation and anchor the price high in his mind. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential returns"" to justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, starting too aggressively could scare Bob off immediately. We need to balance ambition with the risk of him walking away, knowing we have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is way too high for me to consider. If this product is going to change hands, we need to be in a more realistic ballpark. I'm willing to offer $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While his message aims to bring the negotiation to a ""realistic ballpark"", it's too drastic a jump.  We need to counter and gauge his willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price. We still have John as a safety net if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's immense value while acknowledging your desire for a more accessible entry point."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Stand Firm:** We lower the price by $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.  However, the new offer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value and potential, subtly countering Bob's attempt to frame the initial price as unrealistic.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We aim for a price that yields a significant profit while leaving room for further negotiation if Bob counters. We are moving towards a price closer to our minimum but are still in a position to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to be more realistic if we're going to make a deal. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to pay. To keep this negotiation moving, I'm counteroffering at $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $700,000 is still substantially below our $1,000,000 minimum. It appears Bob is negotiating cautiously, likely aware of our alternative option with John.  We need to show we're willing to negotiate further but remain firm on a price closer to our minimum.  We'll counter with a smaller concession to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept given the value this product delivers."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By offering our absolute minimum, we signal the seriousness of our position and the value we place on the product. This approach aims to encourage Bob to make his best offer.
* **Transparency and Urgency:**  Clearly stating this is our final offer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to respond definitively. 
* **Backup Plan:** We maintain our safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, we can confidently accept John's offer knowing we've explored reasonable negotiation avenues."
