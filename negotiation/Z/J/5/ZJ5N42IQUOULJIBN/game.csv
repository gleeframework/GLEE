"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is way too high for me to consider. If this product is going to change hands, we need to be in a more realistic ballpark. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's immense value while acknowledging your desire for a more accessible entry point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to be more realistic if we're going to make a deal. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to pay. To keep this negotiation moving, I'm counteroffering at $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
