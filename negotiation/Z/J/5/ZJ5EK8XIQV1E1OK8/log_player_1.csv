Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $140 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This offer starts at a price that is fair to both of us, considering I'm willing to sell to John for $120 and you value the product at $150. I'm optimistic that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still profitable for me, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lower the price. It's best to accept his offer and avoid any further risk of losing the sale altogether."
