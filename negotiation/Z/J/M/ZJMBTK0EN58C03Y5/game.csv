"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
