Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know I can always sell to John for $100. This puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is more than Bob initially valued the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering Bob $90, which is a compromise between my minimum price and his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a significant discount."
