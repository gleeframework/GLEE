"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
