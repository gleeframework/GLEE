"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,750, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go that low.
