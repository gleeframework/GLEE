"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to gauge his interest with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This initial offer will also provide me with valuable information about Bob's potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  It's not even close to what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll use the next round to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from the initial $2,000,000, but still keeping it above my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum profit margin. I'll reject this offer and try to find a more reasonable price in the next round.  I still have the option to sell to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount. I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm serious about getting a price that's closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm making an effort to meet him halfway and he'll be willing to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm committed to maximizing my profit, and selling for $650,000 would be a huge loss.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can find a compromise. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final concession by lowering my offer to just above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my bottom line.  I'm hoping that this offer will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price. If he rejects this, I will have to seriously consider selling to John as the rounds are getting limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous ones, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. With only a few rounds left, the risk of not reaching a favorable deal with Bob is increasing. 

Considering the following:

* **Time constraint:** We only have two rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in such a short timeframe.
* **Minimum value:** I am committed to earning at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit.

Therefore, the most logical decision is to **sell the product to John**. This guarantees my minimum profit and avoids the risk of losing more time and potentially earning even less in the remaining rounds with Bob."
