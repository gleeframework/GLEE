"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I'm thinking of a price of $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can save at least $20 by rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price.  You are willing to pay $120, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You are still $15 below your maximum price point and $5 above your ideal price point.  You can try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $97.50? "", ""product_price"": 97.5}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, but I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $102.5 is within your acceptable price range, and you're unlikely to get a better deal.  It's a good compromise to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
