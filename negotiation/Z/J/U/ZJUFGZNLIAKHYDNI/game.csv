"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
