"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as it's well below the estimated $1,500,000 worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and a good deal cheaper than buying from John."
