"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $140. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best value while also allowing me to share this exceptional item with someone who appreciates it as much as I do. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Alice or proceed with your backup option (John)."
