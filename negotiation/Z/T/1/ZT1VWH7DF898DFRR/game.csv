"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a significant reduction from the initial price, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to meet the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1950000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and the effort that went into creating it. What are your thoughts?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1750000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing out on the profit I deserve. I'm counteroffering at $1850000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my own interests. What are your thoughts?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1825000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What are your thoughts?",1825000.0,Alice,7,
