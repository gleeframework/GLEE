"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget ($18,000 vs. $12,000 maximum). It's not worth accepting this offer, as you can get a better price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $12,000, I'm offering the lowest price I'm willing to pay. This is also the price John is offering, so if Alice rejects, I can immediately buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is closer to my budget than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum of $12,000. Since John is offering the product for my target price, I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price to $16,000.  This indicates she might be willing to negotiate further. I'm offering $13,000, which is a significant step closer to my desired price while still leaving room for compromise. This offer is a bit more aggressive, hoping to find a meeting point between our expectations.  If Alice rejects, I'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is within my budget and is a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Alice, and I risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer secures the product and allows me to save a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
