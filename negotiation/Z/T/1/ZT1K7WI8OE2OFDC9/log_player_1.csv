Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my maximum budget of $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's aim for a price that's more mutually beneficial. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This price reflects a compromise on both our ends.
