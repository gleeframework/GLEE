"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value:** While Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, she's offering you the product for $925,000. This suggests she's aiming for a higher profit, not necessarily the best deal for you.
* **John's price is your limit:** You've established that your maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Even though John's price is at your limit, it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer.

**Strategy:** 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate with her further or wait for a better opportunity. You also maintain the option to buy from John at a price you've already determined is your maximum."
