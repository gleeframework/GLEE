Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer without trying to negotiate too much.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible strategy. A more aggressive approach could involve a higher initial offer.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown factors that could influence the outcome."
