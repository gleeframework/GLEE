"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $13,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is quite low for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",14500.0,Bob,4,
