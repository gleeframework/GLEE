,,Bob,1,RejectOffer

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I think the product's value is worth more than $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $9500. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $11000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000. How about $10250? I think that's a fair price for the product.",10250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $10250. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to think that the product might not be worth the investment for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
