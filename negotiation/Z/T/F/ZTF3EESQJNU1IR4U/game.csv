"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. You'll be getting a top-quality product at a slightly higher price than what you value it at, but it's still a bargain considering its true worth. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
