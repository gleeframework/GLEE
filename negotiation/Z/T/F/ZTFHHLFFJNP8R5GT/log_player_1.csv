Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm targeting something closer to $1,150,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

We're still meaningfully above John's offer, and I want to test Bob's resolve a bit further. It's a risk, but the potential reward is worthwhile."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,220,000, but that's my final offer.  This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very fair throughout this process.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,185,000.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,185,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,185,000

Bob is clearly anchoring to his initial offer, and while we might be able to squeeze a bit more, accepting at $1,185,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer.  It's a good deal for both sides at this point."
