"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Expressing value:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm willing to counteroffer and try to close the deal with Bob, especially since I'm unsure of his true value for the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to close the deal closer to my initial offer.  How about $13,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a decent profit.
* **Emphasizing a win-win:** My message highlights the possibility of finding a mutually beneficial price, making Bob feel more inclined to agree. 
* **Staying firm:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still a good price for me, giving me some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my minimum and is a good profit margin.
* **Limited time:**  We're in round 4 out of 10, and I want to secure the deal before running out of time.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk Bob will either reject it or stall the negotiations further. It's better to take a good offer now."
