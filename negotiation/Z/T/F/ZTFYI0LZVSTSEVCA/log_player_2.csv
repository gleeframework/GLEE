"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to jump at Alice's initial offer. We don't know if the product is actually worth that much to her, and there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  We're aiming for a significant discount, but not so low that it's immediately insulting. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message shows we're still interested in the product, but need a better price. This keeps the conversation open. 
* **No immediate deadline:**  We're not saying ""take it or leave it,"" which could push Alice away.  We're allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to close the deal closer to my initial offer.  How about $13500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than our initial counteroffer, but shows she's willing to negotiate. We can likely get a better price by continuing to counter.  It's also too early to buy from John, as we haven't yet fully exhausted the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  We're showing flexibility but not giving away too much.  A smaller increment ($500) makes it seem more reasonable to Alice.
* **Positive tone:**  We're emphasizing our desire to close the deal.  This helps keep the conversation friendly and avoids pushing Alice away.
* **No ultimatum:**  We're not demanding this specific price, but expressing our willingness to reach a compromise."
