Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer presents a unique opportunity for you to acquire it at a significant discount compared to its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at Bob's maximum value ($1,000,000) guarantees a sale but leaves potential profit on the table. Offering it too close to my own valuation ($1,200,000) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob values the product for but offers him a substantial saving compared to my alternative buyer.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""discount"" Bob would receive, increasing the offer's attractiveness.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards his $1,000,000 valuation before accepting John's guaranteed offer."
