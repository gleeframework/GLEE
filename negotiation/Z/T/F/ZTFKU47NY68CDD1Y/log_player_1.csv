Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly higher than your value for the product and gives you room to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
