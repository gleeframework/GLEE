"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Based on its potential, I'm setting the price at $1200000.  This reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly higher than your value for the product and gives you room to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me at this time.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still represents a substantial profit for you and a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $950000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit and allowing me to secure the product at a price that works for me.  Let's aim for a final agreement that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
