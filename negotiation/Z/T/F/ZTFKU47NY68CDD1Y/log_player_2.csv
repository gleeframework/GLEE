"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Based on its potential, I'm setting the price at $1200000.  This reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.**  You can always buy from John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly higher than your value for the product and gives you room to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me at this time.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still represents a substantial profit for you and a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than your ideal price point.
