I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,350,000 right now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

```

At this point, Bob has repeatedly refused to go above $1,200,000. I'm not willing to drop lower than $1,300,000 and we've reached an impasse.  I'm running out of rounds and I need to secure the best possible price for my product. It's time to sell to John, who is offering my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
