,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1050000, which would be $975000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $975000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
