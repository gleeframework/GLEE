"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to capture as much of the surplus as possible. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $100,000 difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation without making the offer immediately unacceptable.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
 
**Important Note:**  While I'm aiming for a high price, I need to balance that with the potential risk of losing the deal.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Preserve negotiation leverage:**  Accepting Bob's offer would be a substantial loss. By rejecting his offer, I maintain the ability to counter-offer and try to secure a better price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though I have a backup option with John, there's still the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows that I am willing to compromise, but still not willing to settle for an unacceptable price.
* **Reinforcing the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the worth in my offer.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes a ""win-win"" situation for both of us.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a strategic move. My goal is to inch closer to my ideal price while keeping Bob engaged.
* If Bob rejects this offer again, I will need to re-evaluate my strategy and potentially lower my price slightly.
* However, I will remain firm on my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, even if it means selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1050000, which would be $975000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I need to remain firm in my negotiation and not give in too quickly. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for further compromise:** Even though I have a backup option with John, I believe there's still a possibility of reaching a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground but still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** I'm dropping my price by $50,000, showing flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Important Note:**

* This is a crucial round. If Bob rejects this offer, I might need to consider selling to John, as there is a significant gap between our positions.
* However, I am still hoping to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is just $20000 above my initial target price. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $980,000 is still a significant loss for me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I can continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, I'm still hopeful of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground, but staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* I will emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise, while reiterating my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  $980,000 is closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Small compromise:** I'm dropping my price by $10,000, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** I use positive language and encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John, as I've reached my limit with the negotiation.
* I am aiming to close the deal with Bob as he offers a higher price than John. However, I will not accept a price that is too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but $990000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $985000, which is just $5000 above my initial target price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation limits:**  I've reached my limit in terms of price concessions, and the remaining rounds are not sufficient to bridge the gap between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.
* **Time is of the essence:**  With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high.
* **Secure the guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a profitable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. This decision secures a strong financial outcome and protects my interests."
