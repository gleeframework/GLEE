"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $11,200?",11200.0,Alice,5,
