Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain from it. Let me know your decision by [set a reasonable deadline], as I have another interested buyer waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for the price:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's worth to you, it emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Deadline and alternative buyer:** Introducing a deadline and mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offered price is high, it leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. You can then decide if a slightly lower price is acceptable, knowing you have John as a backup. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
