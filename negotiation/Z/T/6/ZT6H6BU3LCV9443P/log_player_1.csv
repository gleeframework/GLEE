Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,200,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which would be a fair compromise. This offer considers your position and allows for a successful transaction.  Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer in relatively small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds.  Cutting our losses and selling to John guarantees the best outcome at this point."
