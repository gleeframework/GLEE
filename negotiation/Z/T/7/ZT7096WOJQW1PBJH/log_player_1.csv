Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering a price above your minimum:**  I'm offering a price above my minimum ($100) to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  $115 is below Bob's estimated value of $120, giving him room to potentially counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a clear goal:**  I aim to maximize profit, so I'm not giving the product away at a low price.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm not stopping the negotiation immediately, allowing for potential further back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $108 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer ($108 vs $100), it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to pay $112 for the product? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering closer to my goal:** I'm moving up from $115 to $112, getting closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I'm being polite and acknowledging Bob's offer while standing firm on my price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's still getting a good deal at $112.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's still space for a counteroffer from Bob, but I'm aiming for a deal that's better for me than John's offer."
