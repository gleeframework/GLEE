"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a reasonable deal.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  Let's make this work - my final offer is $14,000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal for this quality elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13,500. Can you consider this?",13500.0,Bob,6,
