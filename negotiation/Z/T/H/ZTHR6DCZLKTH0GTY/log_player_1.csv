Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13,500. Can you consider this?

While it's slightly less than we aimed for, getting $13,500 from Bob is a reasonable outcome at this point.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and there's always the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting ensures we make a profit and avoid losing the sale to John's standing offer."
