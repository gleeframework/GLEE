"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price. $1,300,000 is still above his maximum budget, and he has time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances my requirements with your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He has more rounds to negotiate and can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer and offer $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has repeatedly rejected his offer of $1,200,000, and she's only willing to come down to $1,250,000. At this point, Bob has two rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will lower her price to his target.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 ensures he gets the product within his budget."
