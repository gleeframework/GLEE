"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum requirements.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances my requirements with your budget constraints.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer and offer $1,200,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
