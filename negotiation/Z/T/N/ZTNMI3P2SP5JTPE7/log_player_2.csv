"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item that's worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($5,000), you establish a strong negotiating position and leave room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Alice's Position:**  This first counteroffer will give you an idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 

Remember, you can always increase your offer later if needed, but it's harder to negotiate down from a higher starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $9,000 is still higher than your $8,000 maximum and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving from $12,000 to $9,000 indicates she's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance you can get her closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we settle at $6,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer to show Alice you're willing to negotiate, but not by too much.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer ($5,000) and her current one ($9,000).
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying firm and below your maximum budget, you keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $6,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $8,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Your Limit:** Alice's offer of $8,000 matches your maximum budget and the price John is offering. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get you a lower price from Alice. You risk her sticking to $8,000 or even walking away from the deal.

It's a good outcome â€“ you've managed to get the product at the best possible price!"
