"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we settle at $6,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $6,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $8,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
