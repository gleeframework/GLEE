"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $850,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
