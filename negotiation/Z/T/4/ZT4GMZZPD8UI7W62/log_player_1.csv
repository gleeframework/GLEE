Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $900,000? I think that's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too far below my minimum and I still have time to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,037,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve a good outcome. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1037500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair outcome.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've been through several rounds and it seems we're at an impasse.  To guarantee I make at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John."
