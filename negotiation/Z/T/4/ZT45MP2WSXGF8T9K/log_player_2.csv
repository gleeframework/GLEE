"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great price, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $1,200,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $1,500,000. 
* This saves Bob $300,000.
* While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, that's not relevant to Bob's decision.  Bob's goal is to minimize his cost, not to ensure Alice gets a good deal."
