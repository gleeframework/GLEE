"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives me a starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for compromise.  I believe this is a fair price given the potential value of the product, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my initial counteroffer, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $875000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is still higher than my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, and much better than buying from John for $1,500,000. Accepting the offer gives me a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
