"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm motivated to find a solution. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
