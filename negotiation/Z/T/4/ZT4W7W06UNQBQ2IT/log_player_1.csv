Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher price point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offers might still be higher than if I started with a lower price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level and potential price sensitivity. His response will give me valuable information for the next steps in the negotiation. 

It's important to note that while I'm starting high, I'm still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to both of us. I need to strike a balance between being ambitious and not completely alienating Bob with an unrealistic offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Can we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to steer the price closer to my target. Accepting $7,000 would be a substantial loss compared to selling to John. By rejecting and counter-offering, I can:

* **Demonstrate Flexibility:**  Show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Avoid appearing desperate to sell quickly.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:**  Encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob.  However, $7,000 is quite a bit below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I've made a significant concession from $12,000 to $10,000, signaling flexibility. However, I'm holding firm above Bob's offer to show I'm serious about a higher price point.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** My new offer is slightly closer to my initial price than Bob's, but it creates the perception of moving toward a compromise.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** I'm still above my guaranteed $8,000 from John, so I have leverage in case Bob isn't willing to budge much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,500. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Strong Profit:** While not as high as my initial aspiration, $8,500 represents a solid profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal. 

It's often better to accept a favorable offer on the table than to risk losing the sale by pushing too hard."
