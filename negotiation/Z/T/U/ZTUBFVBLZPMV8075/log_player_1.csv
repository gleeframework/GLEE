Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $8,000 and John provides a safety net at $12,000.  Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as related to the product's ""value and features,"" subtly implying it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By stating she's ""open to discussing further,"" Alice encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue, potentially revealing more about his budget or priorities.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price higher than $12,000.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how interested he truly is and how much he might be willing to pay.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice hasn't lost anything. She can then decide whether to negotiate lower or move on to John, ensuring she gets at least her minimum price."
