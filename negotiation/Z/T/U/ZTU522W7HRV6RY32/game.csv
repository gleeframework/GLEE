"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $13,500 is already a competitive offer considering the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $11,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I value your interest in the product and I want to make this work. Let's settle this now - $11,800, and we have a deal.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
