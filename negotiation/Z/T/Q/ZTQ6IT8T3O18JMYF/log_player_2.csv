"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a great price, but I want to see if I can get it even lower.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $250,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still within a range where I believe there's potential for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $300,000, which is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away or increase her offer.  Accepting now saves me time and potentially gets me a better deal than buying from John."
