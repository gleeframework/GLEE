Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a reasonable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Going too close to $1,200,000 leaves potential profit on the table. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **No Justification:** Avoid initially justifying the price.  Let Bob respond first.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the price, you can gauge his willingness to move closer to your desired range."
