{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, starting higher than that is key.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup that Bob might be willing to pay to avoid the risk of missing out.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price."
