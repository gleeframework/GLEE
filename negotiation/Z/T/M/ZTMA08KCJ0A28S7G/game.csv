"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my maximum spending limit, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for this product. This reflects the value I see in it while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value this product offers is truly exceptional and goes beyond a standard market assessment.  To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000.  I believe this still reflects the significant potential for return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This represents a substantial price reduction from your previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreeable outcome.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,900,000 is a firm reflection of its worth, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you acquire this unique asset at a price that still allows for substantial returns. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
