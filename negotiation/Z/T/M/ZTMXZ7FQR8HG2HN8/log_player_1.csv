Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce to Bob that it's worth a significant amount.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you introduce a mild sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $15,000,  this strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob.  You can always negotiate down from your initial offer if needed."
