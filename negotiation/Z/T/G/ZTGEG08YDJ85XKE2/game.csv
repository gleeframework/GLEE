"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is truly exceptional and goes beyond standard market comparisons.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but  $1,200,000 is significantly below its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a number that reflects the value of this product while acknowledging your position. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and represents a great opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a price that fits within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I really need to be closer to $1,200,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that range?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
