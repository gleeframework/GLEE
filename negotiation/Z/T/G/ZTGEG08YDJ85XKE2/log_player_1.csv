Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is truly exceptional and goes beyond standard market comparisons.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we're not there yet. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can push him a bit higher.  We're still significantly closer to our desired outcome than taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a number that reflects the value of this product while acknowledging your position. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and represents a great opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a price that fits within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I really need to be closer to $1,200,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear he is unwilling to meet our minimum acceptable price. His suggestion to ""meet in the middle"" of his range would put us below our guaranteed offer from John. It's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Bob, as he seems anchored to a much lower valuation.  Taking John's offer secures the best outcome for us."
