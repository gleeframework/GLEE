"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
