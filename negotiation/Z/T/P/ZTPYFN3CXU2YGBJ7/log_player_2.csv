"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $15,000 to him, and Alice's offer is too high.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $17500. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,500 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $15,000."
