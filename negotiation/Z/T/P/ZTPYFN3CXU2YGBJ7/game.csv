"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15000, which is the maximum value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $17500. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $15000.  It's the maximum I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
