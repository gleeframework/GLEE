"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $825,000 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with what I am able to afford while still valuing the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
