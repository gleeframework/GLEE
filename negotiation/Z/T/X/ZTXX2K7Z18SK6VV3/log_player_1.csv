Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a bold opening move, but I believe it's important to set a strong starting point.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets the tone for the negotiation and allows for room to compromise if needed.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe there's room for a better deal. I'm confident in the value of my product and want to push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a deal without needing to go back and forth much longer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering my minimum and avoids further negotiation.  It's also a lot better than selling to John for $800,000."
