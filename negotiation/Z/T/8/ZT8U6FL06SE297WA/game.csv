"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, $950000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I can offer you a compromise at $900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above $875000.
