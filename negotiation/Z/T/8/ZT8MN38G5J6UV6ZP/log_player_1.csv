Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This avoids confusion and encourages Bob to respond.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then consider lowering the price slightly or making a counteroffer based on his counteroffer. However, you always have the option to stop the negotiation and sell to John for $15,000 if you feel the negotiation is not going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I would prefer to sell to Bob and avoid selling to John, I need to hold out for a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
