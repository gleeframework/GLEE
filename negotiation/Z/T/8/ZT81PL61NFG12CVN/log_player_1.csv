"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is significantly lower than its value, I understand you have a budget.  Could you consider $11,500?  It's a fairer offer reflecting the true worth of this product."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little, but $11,500 is still too far from what I had in mind.  I could potentially do $6,500.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous one -  $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing some willingness to move, his offers are increasing too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point acceptable to me (above $10,000) within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price."
