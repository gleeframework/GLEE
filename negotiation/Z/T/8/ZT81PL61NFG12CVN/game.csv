"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000. What do you say?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is significantly lower than its value, I understand you have a budget.  Could you consider $11,500?  It's a fairer offer reflecting the true worth of this product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little, but $11,500 is still too far from what I had in mind.  I could potentially do $6,500.  Do you think that would work?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous one -  $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,6,
