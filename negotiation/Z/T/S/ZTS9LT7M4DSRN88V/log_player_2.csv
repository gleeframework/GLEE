It's still worth trying to get a lower price, even if it's just a little bit lower. There's a chance Alice might accept a slightly lower offer, and it's better than paying $9,500."

At this point, Alice has come down to $9,600, which is still higher than John's price of $8,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John. It's best to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
