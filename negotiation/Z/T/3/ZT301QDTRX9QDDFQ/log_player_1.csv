Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to get even more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value"" subtly reinforces that the high price is justified.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes some flexibility. If Bob outright rejects this initial offer, Alice may need to counter-offer to avoid losing him as a buyer. 
* The message strikes a balance between confidence and politeness, important for a successful negotiation."
