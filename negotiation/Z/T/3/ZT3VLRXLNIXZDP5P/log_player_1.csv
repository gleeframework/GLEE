Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $10,500 is more than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $13,000."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $11,000 is a good compromise and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's worth closing the deal now."
