"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $1,400,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,520,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I had hoped for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,560,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1560000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but $1,560,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,480,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1480000.0,Bob,6,
