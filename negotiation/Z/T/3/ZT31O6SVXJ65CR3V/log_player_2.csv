# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12000? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

$11,000 is still above your budget. You can try to negotiate lower, but you're getting closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for this product. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to your limit, it's still above what you want to pay.  You've already reached round 7 and Alice is holding firm. It's safer to buy from John at $8,000 and avoid the risk of Alice refusing your next counteroffer."
