"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find this price attractive, and I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

This is a good price and shows significant movement from Alice. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield much more, and going to John means missing out on this saving."
