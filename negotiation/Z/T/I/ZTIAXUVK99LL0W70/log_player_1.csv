"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my maximum offer, as I have another seller willing to sell it for $800,000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate closer to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my price, the negotiations are progressing slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) without many more rounds. Selling to John guarantees a faster sale at my desired price."
