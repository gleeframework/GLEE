"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my maximum offer, as I have another seller willing to sell it for $800,000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate closer to this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
