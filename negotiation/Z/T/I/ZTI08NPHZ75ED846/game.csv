"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the value it holds for you at $1,000,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This seems like a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
