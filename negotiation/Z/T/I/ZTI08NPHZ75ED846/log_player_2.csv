**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the value it holds for you at $1,000,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This seems like a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
