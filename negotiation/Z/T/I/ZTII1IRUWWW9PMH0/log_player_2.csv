"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $12,000. 
* Alice is offering it for $10,000, which is still above your ideal price point. 
* You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would still be a great profit for you, and a good deal for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still well below what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000. 
* It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a slight decrease in price, potentially less than the $500 you would save by accepting this offer. 
* Accepting Alice's offer saves you time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
