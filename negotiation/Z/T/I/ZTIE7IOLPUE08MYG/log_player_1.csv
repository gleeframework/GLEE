"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options before settling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product.  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price. I'm also mindful of the fact that I have 6 more rounds left to close the deal with Bob, and I don't want to rush into an agreement that doesn't benefit me enough."
