"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit higher than my target. To find a middle ground, I'm offering $10,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
