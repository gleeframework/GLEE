"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the unique value of this product,  $1,500,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial limitations. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
