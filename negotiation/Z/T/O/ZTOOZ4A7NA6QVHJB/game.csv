"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. It's a great price, and I think it's a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $800,000 feels a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This reflects its value for me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident this price will allow you to make a good deal while still giving me a significant discount.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $725,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $712,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.",712500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $712,500. I'm willing to make a small adjustment and offer you the product for $720,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
