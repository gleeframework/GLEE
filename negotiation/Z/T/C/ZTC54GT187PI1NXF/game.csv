"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $120. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Could you do $180? That would be a significant discount on my initial offer.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to make a significant discount, but I'm still not comfortable paying $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. Can you consider this price?",160.0,Bob,4,
