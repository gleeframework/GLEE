"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to sell for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
