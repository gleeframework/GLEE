"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little too much for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is a good compromise. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm confident that the product is worth this price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Alice,5,
