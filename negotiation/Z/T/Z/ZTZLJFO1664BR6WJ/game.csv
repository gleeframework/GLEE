"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we set the product price at $750,000? This would allow me to acquire the product within my budget while still providing you with a reasonable profit.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This price would allow both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,3,
