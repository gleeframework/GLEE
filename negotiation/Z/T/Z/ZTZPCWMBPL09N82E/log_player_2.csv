Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above her value for the product. There's room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is my minimum price. If you're willing to pay that, I'll sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Alice has reached her minimum price. There's no point in further negotiation unless we want to try for a price below her value, which is risky. Accepting at $8,000 secures a good deal."
