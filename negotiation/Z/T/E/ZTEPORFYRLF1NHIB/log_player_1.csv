Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived $8,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** By stating she'll list it publicly, Alice reminds Bob she has other options, even if she doesn't explicitly mention John.

While this offer might be rejected, it positions Alice to potentially negotiate down while still staying well above her minimum acceptable price."
