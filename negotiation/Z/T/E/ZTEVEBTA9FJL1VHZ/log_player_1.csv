{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $11,000 leaves Bob with a potential $1,000 gain, making it a tempting offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, aiming for the higher price with Bob is the best strategy to maximize your earnings."
