"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a fantastic investment for you, and I'm willing to make it a very attractive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, but I'm willing to make some concessions to get us to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to negotiate a higher price, $1,200,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
