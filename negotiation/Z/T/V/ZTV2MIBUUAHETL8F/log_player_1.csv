"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price you're happy with. 
* **Leave Bob Room:** While $150 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for him to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and give you information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** Even though his offer is below your minimum, Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between Bob's offer ($100) and both your minimum ($120) and your initial ask ($150). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** You still have the option to sell to John for your minimum, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but not too drastically. 
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** Aiming for $130 keeps you above your minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning your eagerness to find a ""good home"" for the product, you subtly emphasize its value and justify a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is above your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and effort that can be directed towards other potential sales."
