{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is fair to both of us, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to go lower.  I'm hoping to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but I'm also willing to take the $12,000 from John if it doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm interested in selling to him, $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $12,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $14,000 or even $15,000, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  It's better to secure the sale at $12,000 than to risk getting nothing."
