Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob values the product even higher, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  While I could counter again, it's getting risky.  I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I'll sell to John."
