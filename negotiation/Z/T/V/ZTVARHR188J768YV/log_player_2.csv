Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $1075000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1125000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for a successful transaction for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high, even after coming down a bit.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure how much more I can get her to budge.  At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the better option to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
