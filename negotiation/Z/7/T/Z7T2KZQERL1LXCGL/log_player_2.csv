"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. It's worth exploring if a better deal can be negotiated with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a little less.  I'm prepared to offer $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $13,000 is a substantial step down from Alice's offer and shows Bob is serious about negotiating. This initial counteroffer sets a strong baseline for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $13,500 is a good compromise. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing with each round. It's a good time to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
