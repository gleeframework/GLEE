"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $13,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
