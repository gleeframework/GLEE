"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. We have room to negotiate down towards $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the negotiation closer to a price favorable for me (Bob) while still leaving room for some back-and-forth with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we can still negotiate further. Accepting $9,500 would mean leaving potential savings on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer aims for a price that splits the difference between Alice's current offer and my previous counteroffer. It demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a significant discount."
