Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want the highest price, starting at $120 might scare Bob away. $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if he tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Create Urgency:** I don't explicitly mention John, but implying there might be other interested buyers could encourage Bob to act quickly."
