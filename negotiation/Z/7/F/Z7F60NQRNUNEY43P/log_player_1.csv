Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're starting above your $8,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  You're not starting at a wildly high price that will likely scare Bob off immediately. 
* **It allows for potential counteroffers:**  Bob knows you're willing to negotiate, giving him incentive to counter. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profits, but also consider maintaining a good relationship with Bob if you might need to work with him again in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I believe I can't exceed $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. While you'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation or losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures you get your minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
