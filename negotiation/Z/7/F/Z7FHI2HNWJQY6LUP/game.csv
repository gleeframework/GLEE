"I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $160 for it. Can you meet me in the middle from my original offer?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll sell it to you for $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a compromise.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your original price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'll meet you halfway from your latest offer. I'll pay $152.50 for it. Can you consider that?",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $160, and I think $152.50 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll sell it to you for $170. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",170.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to make a fair compromise, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I'll meet you halfway from your latest offer. I'll pay $165 for it. Can you consider that?",165.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $170, and I think $165 is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more compromise, and I'll sell it to you for $172. It's a bit above my minimum, but I'm willing to make an exception for you.",172.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, but $172 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $168 for it, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $80.",168.0,Bob,10,
