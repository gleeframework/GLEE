"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price of $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset, worth at least that much to you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. Consider this a fair price considering its value and the potential for future gains. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who's willing to pay the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is above his maximum budget. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
