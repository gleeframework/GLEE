This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $825,000, a saving of $375,000 compared to John's price.
* **Alice's Final Offer:**  She's indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away from the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Future counter-offers are unlikely to result in significant price drops. You've already negotiated her down considerably. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for minimal further savings."
