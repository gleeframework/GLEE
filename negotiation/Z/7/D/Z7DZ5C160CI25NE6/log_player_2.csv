"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find highly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Even though Alice is trying to convince you it's a ""one-time offer,"" you know you have a backup option with John. 
* **You save $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer.**  This is a significant amount of money. 

While Alice might be trying to pressure you, it's in your best interest to take the lower price."
