"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $14000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about we meet in the middle at $16500?  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500, which is closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
