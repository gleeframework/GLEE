"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price and I have time to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob has offered $1,200,000, it's below my minimum and I don't want to risk further negotiation with him. With John, I have a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my requirements."
