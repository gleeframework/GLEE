Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  However, $7,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum threshold, and I'm getting closer to the end of our rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
