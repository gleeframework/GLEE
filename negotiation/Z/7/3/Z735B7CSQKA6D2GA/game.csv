"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than I believe the product is worth. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000?  This would leave us both with a fair profit margin.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
