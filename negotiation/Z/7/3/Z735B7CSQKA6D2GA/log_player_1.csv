Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than I believe the product is worth. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,050,000?  This would leave us both with a fair profit margin.
