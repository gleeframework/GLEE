Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid a Low Offer:** Offering too low (close to John's $120) could offend Bob or make him think the product is less valuable than it is.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
