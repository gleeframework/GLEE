"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, aiming to maximize my profit. I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for higher. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still trying to secure a profit above my minimum value of $100. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially having to sell to John for $100."
