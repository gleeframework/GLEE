"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,750 is still outside my budget. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better offer.  I also need to factor in the fact that I can get the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $10,750 is still higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
