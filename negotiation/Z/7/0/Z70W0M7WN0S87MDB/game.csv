"Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $10,750 is still higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's try to meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
