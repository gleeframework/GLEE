"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $825,000.
