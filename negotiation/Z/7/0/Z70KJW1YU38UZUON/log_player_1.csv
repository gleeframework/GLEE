{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for $950,000. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and this price reflects that.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, while also leaving the door open for discussion. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick negotiation but am prepared to go back and forth with Bob a few times if necessary. If he doesn't accept my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if it aligns with my minimum acceptable price. However, I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not overly pressured to make concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can bridge the gap, but I'm not desperate enough to accept his offer right now. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price point of $950,000 or even higher with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing to John:** I'm aware that selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll also carefully consider the language of my counteroffer to ensure it remains persuasive and open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm unable to go as low as $850,000.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? This price still reflects the unique value of the product and provides you with a significant opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $900,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective and framing the counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if needed. This helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Compromise:** Offering a midpoint price shows a willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to consider my perspective. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product to remind Bob of its potential benefits, which might sway him to agree to a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing further or if it's time to move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $880000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to make one more counteroffer to try and bridge the gap, but if he doesn't budge, I'm confident in selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer is only $120,000 less than John's offer, meaning the potential risk of rejecting and potentially losing to John is lower.
* **Desire for higher price:** I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial desired price of $950,000, or at least a price closer to $900,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price, and I believe I can still push for a slightly higher offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my previous offer of $900,000, while also considering the potential risk of losing to John. I'll try to make a final appeal based on the product's unique value and the potential for a long-term relationship. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll happily sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above your current offer.  Considering the product's unique features and potential for your business, I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is my final offer, and it's a significant concession on my part. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial, and we can build a long-term partnership. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $890,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a small step closer to Bob's price point but still significantly above his last offer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's position while also emphasizing the product's unique value and potential for a long-term partnership. This creates a sense of urgency and builds a case for a deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer signals my willingness to make a final concession, potentially pushing Bob to accept. It leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk assessment:** While still higher than Bob's last offer, it's very close to John's offer, reducing the risk of losing out on the sale.
* **Partnership appeal:**  Highlighting the potential for a long-term relationship might sway Bob towards accepting the offer, as it implies future opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my final counteroffer, I'll happily sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
