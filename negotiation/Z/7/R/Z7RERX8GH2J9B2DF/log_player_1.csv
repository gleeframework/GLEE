Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  it's always worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Find a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between what Bob values it at ($1,000,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing this as a time-sensitive offer, we increase the perceived value and encourage Bob to act quickly."
