{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation will maximize your profit. However, being too aggressive (e.g., asking for $990,000) might make Bob reconsider even though it's still a good deal for him.
* **The Offer:** $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a $75,000 discount on his perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll accept the offer rather than risk losing the deal."
