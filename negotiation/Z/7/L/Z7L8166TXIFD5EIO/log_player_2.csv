Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects its true value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above your desired price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  It's a good compromise, and you're closer to your budget than if you were to buy from John.  There's always a risk of pushing further and potentially losing the deal, so accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point."
