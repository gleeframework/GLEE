{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, but it's still lower than what I would get from John. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $9500 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $12,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable value."
