{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a relatively high price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm starting high because:

* **It's better to start high and negotiate down than start low and regret missing out on potential profit.** 
* **It signals that I value the product highly, which might make Bob take the offer more seriously.**

I'll be keeping John's offer in mind and adjusting my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it,  I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I value the product at $15,000 minimum, and John is a guaranteed buyer for that price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $20,000 to $17,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a good profit. I'm also reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept and close the deal. There's no point in further negotiation as I'm guaranteed the same price from John."
