Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This gives us both some room to negotiate, and I'm confident the product will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I'd like to push for more, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price range.  It's also within a reasonable margin compared to selling to John.  I'll accept the offer."
