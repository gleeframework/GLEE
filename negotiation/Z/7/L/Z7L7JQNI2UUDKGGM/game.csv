"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me. However, $13500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  I believe that's a fair price, given the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product to you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
