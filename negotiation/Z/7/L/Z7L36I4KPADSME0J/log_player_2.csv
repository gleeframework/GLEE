"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's ample opportunity to negotiate. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counteroffer process and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with my maximum budget of $12,000 as my initial counteroffer. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but have a firm limit.
* This sets the negotiation baseline and allows Alice to either accept (ideal scenario) or counter with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.
* We have several rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it's showing a willingness to negotiate.
* I'm increasing my counteroffer to $13,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer but still well below her latest offer.
* This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also have a firm budget limit.
* This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and potentially finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* $16,500 is closer to my budget but still not ideal. I want to see if I can get it even lower.
* We still have five rounds left. This gives us enough time to potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* Rejecting this offer lets me continue the negotiation and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. 
* This round, I'm increasing my offer again to $14,000. This shows progress and demonstrates my willingness to meet her halfway. 
* Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Alice to consider. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $16,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. 
* We only have three rounds left, so the pressure is on to get a better deal.
* Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to counter and hopefully reach a price closer to my $12,000 limit.  It's possible Alice will counter down again, making a deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly coming down in price, but she's still above my maximum budget.
* We have two rounds left. To make this deal happen, I need to make a significant leap in my offer, which I'm willing to do in this round.
* I'm counteroffering at $15,000, which is in between her last offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal and am willing to compromise. 
*  If she rejects, I can either counter again or go with John's offer, as I'm approaching my final round."
