"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and what others are willing to pay for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $10800 is a step closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10200 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and our back-and-forth. Let's make this deal happen.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into our negotiation. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to refuse.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10500 is still a little outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $10100 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation. Let's finalize this deal.",10100.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the price I was willing to sell to John. However, I'm willing to make one more concession for you, Bob. I'm counteroffering at $10200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I hope you can meet me in the middle.",10200.0,Alice,9,
