"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet you at $10,500. I would like to propose $9,500 as a potential compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 isn't my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and getting closer to my desired outcome. I'd rather secure a sale now than risk losing the deal with Bob and then potentially having to sell to John for a lower price later."
