"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,350,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  To be frank, I'm only comfortable going as high as $925,000.  Let me know if that works for you, otherwise, we might need to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
