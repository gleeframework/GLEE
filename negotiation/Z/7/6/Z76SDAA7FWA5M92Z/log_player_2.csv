"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget of $150. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
