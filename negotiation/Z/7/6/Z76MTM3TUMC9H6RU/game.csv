"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $13,000 is still a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true worth of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
