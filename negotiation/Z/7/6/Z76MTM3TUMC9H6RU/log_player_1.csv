"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to counteroffer at $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $13,000 is still too low, but I'll see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $13,000 is still a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true worth of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
