"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $13,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while remaining fair to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
