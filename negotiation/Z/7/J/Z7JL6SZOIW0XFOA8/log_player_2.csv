"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and sets the stage for potential back-and-forth."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal target. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get it closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000.  There's still room for a deal, and I want to explore it further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount. It's a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's last offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise, getting us closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000 while still being significantly lower than the $1,500,000 price from John. It's worth accepting to avoid potentially going back and forth further with Alice, as there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
