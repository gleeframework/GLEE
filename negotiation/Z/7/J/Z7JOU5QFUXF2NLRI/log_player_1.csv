Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I get a good price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. 
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  I still have the option of walking away and getting $150 from John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? This is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $120 splits the difference between my initial offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($100). 
* **Finding a Compromise:**  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Staying Close to my Minimum:** $120 is still closer to my minimum of $150, leaving room for potential future negotiation if needed."
