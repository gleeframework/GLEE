Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested as the product is worth $100 to him. Let's see if he's willing to pay a little extra!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to give some ground, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a fair compromise, as it's a significant step down from my initial offer but still above my minimum.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob, considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $105 is a good deal, especially considering my minimum.  It's also higher than what I could get from John.  It's time to close this deal!"
