{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more for the product, and I'm leaving room for negotiation. It's also important to maintain a positive and friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that is too far below my own value for the product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $120 is your limit, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $135, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident I'll get the best price by selling to him."
