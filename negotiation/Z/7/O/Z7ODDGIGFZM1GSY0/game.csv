"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand you may not know the full potential of this, but I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential value, but I need to be sure it's a fair deal for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $2000000?  This would be a significant investment, but I believe it could offer a tremendous return.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
