Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still gives him some room for negotiation. It also leaves me a good profit margin while keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget and I'm trying to be responsible with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial situation, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $10500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and still a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or even a stalemate, potentially leading me to sell to John. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
