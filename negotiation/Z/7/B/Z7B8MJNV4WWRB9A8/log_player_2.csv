"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be extremely valuable for your business.  My initial offer is $1,000,000.  This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from using it.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is still quite a bit more than your target of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds and Alice is motivated to sell (her value is $800,000).  This suggests there's a chance you can get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiation fails, you can always buy from John. It's important to keep this in mind to set a firm upper limit on your offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given my budget constraints, I'd like to offer $900,000.  This is still a significant profit for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $950,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for you and gives us room to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.** Her offer is now closer to your target price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 7 rounds left and you're still above your target. A bit more negotiation could get you closer to your goal.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** Remember, you can always go to John if you don't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a healthy profit for you and a good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a substantial profit for you and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're getting close, but still not at the target.**  $940,000 is closer to your goal, but you're still a bit above your ideal price.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 5 rounds left.  A little more back-and-forth could lead to a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Remember, you can always go to John if the deal with Alice falls through. 

**Strategy:** It's a good idea to keep making small counteroffers, trying to chip away at the price.  This shows Alice you're serious about the deal but not willing to overpay."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $940,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm ready to offer $930,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a substantial profit for you while meeting my budget constraints. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 930000}
