Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product has great potential value, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12000. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's a bit lower than what I initially wanted, it's a good deal considering I only have 4 rounds left.  Plus, I'm getting closer to my desired price.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and I'm confident I can get a better price next time!"
