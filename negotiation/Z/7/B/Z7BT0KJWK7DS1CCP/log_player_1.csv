"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm starting the price at $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is above my minimum threshold of $8,000,  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  He's shown interest, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is closer but still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $8000?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum threshold, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds.  Furthermore, if I reject his offer, there's no guarantee I can get a better price, and I risk losing the sale entirely.  Selling to John for $8,000 would be equivalent to accepting Bob's offer, so accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action in this situation."
