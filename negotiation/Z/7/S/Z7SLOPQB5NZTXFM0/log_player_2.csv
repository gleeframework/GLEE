Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can try to find a middle ground between his last offer and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutual agreement, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to suggest $10,900 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while being more accessible to your budget. I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $10,900, which is still more than Bob's initial budget of $10,000.  Since John is offering the product at his budget price, it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and save time."
