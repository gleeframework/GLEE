"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
