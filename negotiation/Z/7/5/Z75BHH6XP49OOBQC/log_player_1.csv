Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and my offer:

**Strategy:**

Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at our minimum acceptable price, we have leverage with Bob. We want to maximize our profit but also avoid being too greedy and scaring Bob away. 

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confidence:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's ""exceptional"" nature, building value.
* **Justification:** We provide a reason for the high price (""unique value,"" ""true worth"").
* **Round Number:**  Using a round number like $1,000,000 can make it feel more psychologically palatable than, say, $987,500.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style. If we knew he was very price-sensitive, a lower starting price might be better.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. We need to be prepared to negotiate, knowing our bottom line is $800,000."
