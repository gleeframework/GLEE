I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. I'm aiming to find a price that is appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value and further negotiation might be time-consuming with uncertain outcome. John offers a guaranteed price that is equal to my minimum acceptable value. Therefore, selling to John is the most reasonable option."
