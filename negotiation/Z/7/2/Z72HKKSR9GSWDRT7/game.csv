"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a great deal on the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which would be $100. Can we do that?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  How about we meet at $102.50?  It's a small compromise from both of us, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  What do you think?",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $98. Can we do that?",98.0,Bob,8,
