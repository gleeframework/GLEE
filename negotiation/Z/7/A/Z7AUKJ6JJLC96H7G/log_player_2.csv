Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This represents a significant discount for you, and it's a fair price for the value this product offers.  I hope we can reach an agreement.
