"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still a loss for you. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept this offer to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I still have time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price that is lower than what I would pay for the product from John. It's important to strike a balance between being firm on my desired price and showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $122 is beyond my budget and even higher than what I would pay John. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not likely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. I'll choose to buy from John and avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation."
