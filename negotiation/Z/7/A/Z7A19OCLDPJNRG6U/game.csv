"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,050,000? This still leaves room for you to profit and is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this negotiation.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
