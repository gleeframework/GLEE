"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by counter-offering.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a price closer to Alice's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000 for the product.  This price would still be a significant profit for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your offer. I'm willing to go down to $10000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but Bob still has room for improvement.  There's a good chance Bob can push for a price closer to $9,000 by rejecting the current offer and making another counter-offer.  It's important to remember that Bob has a ceiling of $15,000, so he doesn't want to get too close to that number."
