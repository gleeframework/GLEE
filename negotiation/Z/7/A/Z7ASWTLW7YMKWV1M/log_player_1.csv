{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I believe this will motivate Bob to consider the offer and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $9000 for the product.  This price would still be a significant profit for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I can likely do better.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your offer. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my counteroffer of $10,000.  It's a good deal for me and still a great deal for Bob.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
