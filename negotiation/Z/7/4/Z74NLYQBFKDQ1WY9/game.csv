"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite low for the value this product provides. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to do $125? I think that's a fair compromise.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $125.  Would you consider $160? That's my final offer.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $140. That's the best I can do.",140.0,Bob,6,
