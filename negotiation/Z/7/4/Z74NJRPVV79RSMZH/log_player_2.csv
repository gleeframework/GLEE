"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I think $11,000 is a fair price considering its value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still more than Bob's maximum value of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum value ($12,000) as possible.  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  Bob is also being polite and emphasizing his interest in the product, which could help sway Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. Could we agree on $10,600? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $10,600 is closer to his maximum value, he can still try to get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer gives him another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,600. How about we meet in the middle at $10,300?  I'm confident this price works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's in the middle ground between his last offer and Alice's.  $10,300 is a slight increase from his previous offer, but it's still a good deal for him and leaves room for potential compromise.  By mentioning a ""middle ground,"" Bob is subtly suggesting a fair and agreeable solution."
