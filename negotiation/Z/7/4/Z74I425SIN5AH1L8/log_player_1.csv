Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a price closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than I was hoping for, it's above my minimum price of $15,000 and a good compromise given the negotiation back and forth.  I'm happy to secure the sale and avoid potentially going back and forth with Bob any further."
