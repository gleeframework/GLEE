"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great asset, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a valuable asset at a price that's fair to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",950000.0,Bob,4,
