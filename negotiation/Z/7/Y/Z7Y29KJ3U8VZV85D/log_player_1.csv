Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with Bob's initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is better than John's offer, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John if further negotiation with Bob fails."
