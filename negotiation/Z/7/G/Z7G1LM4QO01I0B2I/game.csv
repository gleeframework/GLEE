"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe you'd find it equally valuable.  My starting price is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $1,500,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product.  This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I've already lowered my price significantly.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,400,000. If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is a fair price. ",1400000.0,Alice,7,
