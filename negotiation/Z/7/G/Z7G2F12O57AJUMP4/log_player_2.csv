"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair market value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  I'm willing to pay you $12,000 right now, and I think it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still over his maximum. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $17,000, which is a bit above our previous discussion, but I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer is still above his budget and the negotiation seems to be going in circles. Buying from John ensures he gets the product for his maximum price and saves him the time and effort of further negotiation."
