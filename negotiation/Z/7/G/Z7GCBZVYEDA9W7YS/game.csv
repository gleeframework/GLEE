"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for something worth $100 to you! Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $88?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $88 is a reasonable offer.  I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a very fair price, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal!",89.0,Alice,5,
