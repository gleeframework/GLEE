"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.  ",9500.0,Alice,3,
