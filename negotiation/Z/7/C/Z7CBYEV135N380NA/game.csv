"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's significantly lower than what I need to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1500000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1300000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about we settle on $1400000? This price is fair to us both and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
