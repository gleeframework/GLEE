"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $750,000.  This is a reasonable compromise that still allows for a good profit for you. Let's close this deal!",750000.0,Bob,4,
