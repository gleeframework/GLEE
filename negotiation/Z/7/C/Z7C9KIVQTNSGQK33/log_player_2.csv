It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  There's room for a better price than $1,050,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.

Alice has come down to my price point, and I can get the product for the same price as John.  There's no need to continue negotiating."
