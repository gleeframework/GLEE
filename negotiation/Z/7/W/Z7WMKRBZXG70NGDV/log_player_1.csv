Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While $9,000 is a better offer than my minimum, I still have a few rounds to try and get closer to my desired price. I will reject and make a counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I still think $10500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
