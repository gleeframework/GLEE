"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that's worth a lot to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer it to you for $16,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $16,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both place on the product. Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer it to you for $17,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",17000.0,Alice,7,
