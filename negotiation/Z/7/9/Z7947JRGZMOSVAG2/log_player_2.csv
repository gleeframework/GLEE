"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. Let's make this deal happen. I propose a price of $110 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice.  We have room to go lower before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'll revise my offer to $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower. Let's see if we can get her closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and make it $92.50?"",
""product_price"": 92.50
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows we're willing to compromise, but still want a good deal.  It puts the negotiation back in Alice's court while staying below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your offer, I propose $93.75 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to move much lower than this.  $93.75 is a good price and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
