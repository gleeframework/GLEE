Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I think I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer for $9,200. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,200 is still significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's important to be realistic and recognize a good deal when I see it."
