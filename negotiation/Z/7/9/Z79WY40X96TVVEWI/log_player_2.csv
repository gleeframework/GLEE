Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $950000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's likely that you won't be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Therefore, the best option is to buy the product from John for $800,000."
