"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,
