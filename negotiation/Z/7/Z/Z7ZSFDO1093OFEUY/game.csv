"I'm really interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $650000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $675000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",675000.0,Bob,6,
