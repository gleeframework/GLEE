**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is stuck at the lower end of his budget and is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's clear he values the product much lower than your minimum, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable.  It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
