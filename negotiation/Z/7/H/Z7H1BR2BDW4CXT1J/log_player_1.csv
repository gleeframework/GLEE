"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $15000 to ensure we both benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, as it matches my own valuation. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  I can use this round to gauge his negotiating style and prepare for future interactions if needed."
