Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $150.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100.  This is a smaller compromise than my last offer, showing Bob that I'm still serious about getting a fair price, but I'm also getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to buy."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $150. I'll go ahead and sell to John for $150 to ensure I don't lose money."
