"Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the consideration.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,875?",10875.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,875. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,375. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",11375.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer.",11250.0,Alice,9,
