Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a reasonable starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible, but I'm also prepared to adjust my offer if needed, or to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject his offer and try to get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident that I can get him to come up to my acceptable range.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to go with that option."
