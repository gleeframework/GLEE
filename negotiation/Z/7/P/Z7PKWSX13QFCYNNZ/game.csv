"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to go that high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal quickly. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
