Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a great starting point for negotiation! You can definitely do better than $900,000. By rejecting the offer, you open the door to a counteroffer and a chance to save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
