"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in purchasing the product but would need to start at a lower price point. I'd like to offer $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  While I'm closer to your offer, $825000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,,
