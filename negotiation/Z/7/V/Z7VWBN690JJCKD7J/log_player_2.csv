(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $9,500.  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, so it's tempting. However, you can get the product from John for $10,000. This means you can counter-offer Alice at a lower price, or simply go with John.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
