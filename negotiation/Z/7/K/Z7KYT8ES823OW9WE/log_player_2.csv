{""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value. This gives Alice room to negotiate but also shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer shows she's willing to compromise.  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept without feeling pressured, but it also shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $950,000 for this product. I'll keep negotiating and see if I can convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer is getting closer to my target price. I'm going to make a final counteroffer, increasing my price just slightly to show I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still a good deal for me compared to John's price. This might push Alice to accept, as she is likely becoming more willing to settle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my previous counteroffer. At this point, the negotiation seems to be going in circles. The price is getting closer to John's price, which is my maximum budget.  It's better to avoid further negotiation and simply buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
