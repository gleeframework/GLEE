"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $135 is still within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than the product's value to Alice ($120). 
* **Negotiation:**  Bob has already made a counteroffer, and it was rejected.  Further negotiation may risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become firm and refuse to budge. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, minimizing potential losses.
* **John:**  The offer from John is still more expensive than Alice's current offer."
