"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly below what I know Bob values it at, hoping to get a quick deal. I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
