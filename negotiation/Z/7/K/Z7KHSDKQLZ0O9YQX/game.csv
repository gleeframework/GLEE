"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I recognize the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $6,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming closer to a price point that works for me, Alice. While $9,000 is better, I'm aiming to keep my expenses lower on this purchase. How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to keep expenses low, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
