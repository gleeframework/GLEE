Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, aiming for a good profit. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $8,500, which is still higher than my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
