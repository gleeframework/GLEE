Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7,500, Bob. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?

Alice has come down to her minimum price, which is a good deal for you. There's no guarantee you can negotiate a lower price, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  It's best to accept now."
