"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and $7,000 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about $7,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7,500, Bob. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
