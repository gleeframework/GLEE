"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity for both of us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and is the very top of my budget. Let's find a way to make this deal work for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $975,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the current market. I'm confident this will work for both of us, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
