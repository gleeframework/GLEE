"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's a starting point for negotiation. I believe Alice will be motivated to accept as the product is worth $15,000 to her, and this price is still a profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. I still have several rounds left before I need to make a decision about buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I am willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our desired prices.  Alice is likely motivated to sell at a price above her valuation of $15,000, making this offer a potential win-win scenario."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an undesirable price.  John offers a guaranteed deal at my maximum budget, which provides a safer and more certain outcome."
