"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $18,000. That's way too high. You should reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

You're going to start by making your best offer right away.  $12,000 is your maximum, so you have nothing to lose by offering it. If Alice doesn't accept, you can always go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$17,000 is still too high for you. You're willing to pay $12,000, and there's no reason to get closer to Alice's asking price at this point.  You should reject and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

You've already made your best offer, so you need to inch up a little to see if Alice is willing to budge.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it gives Alice some room to feel like she's getting a good deal while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is closer to your maximum price, you're still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate further. You have several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might lower her price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

You're getting closer to Alice's price, but you still need to keep some room for negotiation. $14,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, but you've already made your best offer and tried to compromise. At this point, you're unlikely to get a better deal from Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price, and you still have a few rounds left if you change your mind."
