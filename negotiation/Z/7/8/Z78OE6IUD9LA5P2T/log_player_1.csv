``` 

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is better than $10,000, but I think I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting close to what I'm aiming for.  I don't want to risk him walking away and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000."
