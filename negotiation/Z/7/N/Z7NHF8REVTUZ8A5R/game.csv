"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me and the compromise you're offering.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9800 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, Alice. However, $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me and the compromises we've made so far.",9500.0,Bob,6,
