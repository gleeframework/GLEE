"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking for $200. It's not a good deal for you.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $160 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay $160, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
