"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is closer to that range. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow the transaction to proceed smoothly. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
