Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.

# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession, but  $14,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know your decision.
