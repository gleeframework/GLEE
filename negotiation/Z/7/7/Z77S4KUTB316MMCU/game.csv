"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about $13,000? I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession, but  $14,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know your decision.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be careful with my budget.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $11,500 is simply not enough. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm already making a significant compromise.  Let's split the difference: $13,250. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,8,
