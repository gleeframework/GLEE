# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact, I propose a price of $10,000 for this exclusive offering. This price reflects not only the cost but also the strategic advantage it could bring to your operations. I look forward to discussing how this product can enhance your company's performance. Please let me know if you need more information or have any questions. Best regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Therefore, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
