# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. This means you get a good deal, and Alice still profits."
