{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it. It also sets a clear price point and shows you are willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for me. I'll try one more time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $112. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still within your budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway between our last offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is the final round of negotiation, and Bob is not willing to go higher than $105, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already made several counteroffers and am unwilling to continue haggling further. It's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $120, securing a better price and ending the negotiations."
