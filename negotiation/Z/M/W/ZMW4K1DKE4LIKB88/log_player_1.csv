"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

I'm reducing my price to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it still leaves room for a profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a better option than accepting this offer.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a further compromise and puts us halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer.  It shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement, but it's also a price that still leaves me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement that's beneficial for me. At this point, selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, and it's the most sensible option."
