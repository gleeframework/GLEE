"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8500. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $8000, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $9500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,4,
