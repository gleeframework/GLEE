Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much larger profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then gradually lower the price,  using your $1,000,000 guarantee as a safety net.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses positive and confident language to emphasize the product's value and increase its desirability.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk, as you have a guaranteed buyer at a price that already meets your minimum."
