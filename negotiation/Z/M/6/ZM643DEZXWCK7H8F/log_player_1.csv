"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting position.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not asking for the full $1,200,000 value to Bob, as this may make him immediately reject the offer.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the potential profit, while still leaving some room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **The John Factor:** The possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 is a key factor in my decision.  This means I can't be too greedy with Bob.  If the negotiations go poorly, I have a guaranteed backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** Bob's offer is still less than my initial offer, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a better deal.
* **John Factor:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to the $1,150,000 mark.  Rejecting this offer keeps my options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Still Profitable:** This price still allows me to make a significant profit while ensuring Bob is also getting a decent deal.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm still holding out for a higher price but showing that I'm willing to negotiate reasonably. This puts pressure on Bob to accept or make a closer counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 away from John's offer.  
* **Time is Money:** With limited rounds remaining, it's important to close the deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $50,000, which is better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a better deal, but there's also a risk of losing the deal entirely. 

**This is a calculated risk. It's possible I could get a better deal in the remaining rounds, but the possibility of losing the deal entirely makes this a good time to accept.**"
