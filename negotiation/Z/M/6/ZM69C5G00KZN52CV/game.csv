"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit and you to get a valuable product at a good price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,375? I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,375. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to be closer to $10,000. How about $10,200? Can you consider this offer?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,225.  That's just a small step further from my last offer, and hopefully it's enough for us to reach an agreement.",10225.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $10,225. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to be closer to $10,000. How about $10,150? Can you consider this offer?",10150.0,Bob,8,
