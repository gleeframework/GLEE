Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the best price I can offer for now.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you be open to $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is the best I can do for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly stuck in a pattern of meeting in the middle, but her starting point is too far from what we're willing to pay.  It's unlikely we'll get a better deal than John's offer."
