"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $825000. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from there.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in making a deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
