"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's try $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. $8,500 is close, but I have a firm budget for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me at $7,000? This would be a great price for me and help me close out this purchase.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  The product is truly valuable, and I believe $8,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",8000.0,Alice,7,
