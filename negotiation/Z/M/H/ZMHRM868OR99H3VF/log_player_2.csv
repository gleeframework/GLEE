"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a valuable piece and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer of $17,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $17,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum.  He can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try to push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $15,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,250?  That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15250}
