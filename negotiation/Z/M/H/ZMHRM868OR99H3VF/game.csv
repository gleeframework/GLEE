"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $17,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $15,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,250?  That seems like a fair compromise.",15250.0,Bob,4,
