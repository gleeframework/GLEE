Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price significantly higher than my minimum but lower than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Bob:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The offer leaves room for counteroffers, giving Bob a chance to negotiate. 

By starting with this offer, I aim to find a price point that maximizes my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:** While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's room to get a better price from Bob. He's clearly interested and willing to pay above my minimum, so further negotiation is likely to yield a higher price.
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and may push him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that my counter-offer is still a good deal.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  The message is positive and encouraging, suggesting a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both our interests and leads to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob has increased his offer to $10,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and his last offer of $9,000. 
* **Profit Margin:**  While it's not my ideal price, accepting his offer guarantees a profit of $2,000, which is significantly higher than selling to John for $8,000. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob's interest completely and being forced to sell to John at a much lower price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a decent profit and avoiding the potential for a worse outcome."
