,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $107.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",107.5,Bob,4,
