"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  To get us started, I'm proposing a price of $200.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $200 is way above your maximum budget of $120.  It's best to reject and start counter-offering to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
