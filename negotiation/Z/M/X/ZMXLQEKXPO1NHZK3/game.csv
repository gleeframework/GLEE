"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would give us both a good outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
