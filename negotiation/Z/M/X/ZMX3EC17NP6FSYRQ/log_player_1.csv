"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  By offering a concrete price and asking for Bob's thoughts, you encourage an open dialogue and show you're willing to work with him.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's offer is low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it gets me closer to my target price.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a little higher. There are 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 yet.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? This is a good price point for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  However, $1150000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $1125000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $1,125,000, which is very close to my target price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure if I can get any higher.  It's time to accept his offer and close this deal."
