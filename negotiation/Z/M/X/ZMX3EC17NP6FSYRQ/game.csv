"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it gets me closer to my target price.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1150000? This is a good price point for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  However, $1150000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $1125000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point. What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
