"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $700,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be open to something closer to $600,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
