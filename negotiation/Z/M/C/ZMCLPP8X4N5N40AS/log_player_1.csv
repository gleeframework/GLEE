"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and using a friendly tone to encourage a positive response.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $10,000 offer allows for potential concessions if Bob counteroffers.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a win-win situation. By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While I'd like to sell, $8,500 is too low for me, as my floor is $12,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I have several rounds left, and I can still try to get closer to my desired price with counteroffers.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome.**  While I prefer to negotiate with Bob, I have a backup plan that ensures I'll get my minimum value.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations to see if I can get a better price. If I can't, I have the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,500, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us. 
* **Maintain a Margin:** $9,500 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring a profit.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. By offering a slightly lower price but still maintaining a significant profit margin, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $9,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  We've had several rounds, and Bob seems willing to negotiate. There's still room for me to try and push for a higher price.
* **John is a Guarantee:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, but if it looks like the negotiation isn't going anywhere, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit below my ideal price. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also allowing us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a smaller compromise this time, only $250 from my previous offer.
* **Focus on Fair Deal:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price that benefits both parties.
* **Maintain Margin:**  $9,250 is still above my minimum, leaving room for a good profit.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, using small increments to try and close the deal. By focusing on fairness and a win-win situation, I aim to reach an agreement that satisfies both our needs. If Bob rejects, I'll reassess my options and consider selling to John if necessary."

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic about my next move.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. I'm making a small concession to demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground.
* **Clear Deadline:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and that I'm ready to move on to other opportunities if he rejects it.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and there's little chance of Bob agreeing to a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed win and the best outcome for me at this point. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm satisfied with securing a profitable sale."
