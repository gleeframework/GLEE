Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** Leaving room for potential counteroffers while still securing a good profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Focusing on the value proposition for Bob and leaving the door open for further discussion. 

Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Provides a reasonable compromise:**  It's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reinforces the value of the product:**  I'm emphasizing that the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and keeps the option of selling to John open if Bob still refuses to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to that amount, I'm confident that I can get a good profit with this deal. Additionally, this offer signifies a willingness from Bob to meet me halfway, and it's important to acknowledge that. It's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate and potentially lose Bob's interest altogether."
