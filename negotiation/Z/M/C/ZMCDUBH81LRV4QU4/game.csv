"I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
