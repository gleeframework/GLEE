"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you are willing to pay up to $12,000, it makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal than $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's agreeable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'm not yet ready to give up on negotiating a lower price. I'm willing to risk another round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $8,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this offer will be agreeable to Alice, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original offer, and $8,200 is a good price for me.  While I would like to save even more money, there's a risk that if I keep rejecting offers, Alice will become less willing to negotiate and I could end up paying closer to $12,000 to John.  This price is a good compromise and allows me to buy the product while staying within my budget."
