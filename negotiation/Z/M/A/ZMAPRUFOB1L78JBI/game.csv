"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $12000 for it, which is still a good price considering my maximum budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
