"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will justify it. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1500000. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
