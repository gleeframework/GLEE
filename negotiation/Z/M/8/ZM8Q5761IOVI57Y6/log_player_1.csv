Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate a better price.  I want to see if I can push him a little higher before considering selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,375,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I still think I can push for a bit more. I'm not ready to settle for a price that's so close to my minimum, especially since I still have some negotiating rounds left."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While I'd ideally like to get a bit more, $1,375,000 is a good price, especially since I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. It's a good amount above my minimum, and it's probably the best deal I can get at this point."
