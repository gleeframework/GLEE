"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,375,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still slightly below my target. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,387,500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1387500.0,Alice,5,
