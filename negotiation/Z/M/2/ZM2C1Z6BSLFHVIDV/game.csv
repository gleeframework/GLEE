"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $8,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $9,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",9500.0,Alice,5,
