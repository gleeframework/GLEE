"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much as possible from my $1,000,000 limit.
* **John as Backup:** I have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit below my target. I can do better than that. How about $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for improvement. I'm aiming to get closer to $900,000, which would be a good deal compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise. It shows I'm willing to move closer to her price while still seeking a significant saving.
* **Clear Target:**  By proposing a specific number, I'm setting a clear target and avoiding a back-and-forth that might stall the negotiation.
* **John Option Still Available:**  I can still buy from John if Alice rejects this offer, so there's limited risk in aiming for this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $925,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $925,000 is a significant saving compared to my alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has signaled she's willing to compromise but is unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing further could make Alice walk away, and I'd lose the potential savings."
