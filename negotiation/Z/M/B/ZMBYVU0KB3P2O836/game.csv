"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your initial offer, but $1,900,000 is firm to start. This product offers significant value that justifies the price. Would you be willing to consider something closer to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Could you consider $1,650,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
