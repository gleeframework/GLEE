Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
