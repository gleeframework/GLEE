"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above my ideal price. I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the value of the product and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. While I'd still prefer to pay less, it's significantly lower than the initial price and the price from John.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product and avoid further negotiations."
