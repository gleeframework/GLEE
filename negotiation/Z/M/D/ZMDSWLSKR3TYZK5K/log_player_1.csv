"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage acceptance. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $175 starting point allows for multiple rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for Better Price:**  While I could sell to John for $150, I still have 8 rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Bob.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? I'm confident you'll still be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth the price, while also being willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $145 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely, or I may not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to secure a higher price. 

Selling to John at this point guarantees me $150, but accepting Bob's offer ensures a quicker sale and reduces the chance of losing the deal altogether."
