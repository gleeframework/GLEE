I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can still make a counteroffer or sell to John."

$11,000 is too low for me. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise, but I still need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."
