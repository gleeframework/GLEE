Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I can generate with it, and it would allow me to make a good profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, $1,080,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I believe a price of $1,120,000 is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1120000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I can generate with the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and represents a decent profit.  It's better than selling to John at this point, so I'll accept."
