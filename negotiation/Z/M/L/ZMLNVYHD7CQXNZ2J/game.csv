"Bob, I believe this product has great potential for you and I'm confident it can generate significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I place on it while also giving you a fair margin for profit.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I can generate with it, and it would allow me to make a good profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",1080000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, $1,080,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I believe a price of $1,120,000 is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I can generate with the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
