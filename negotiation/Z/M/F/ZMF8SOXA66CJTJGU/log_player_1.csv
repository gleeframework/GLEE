Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1 million.  This is a strong opening offer that acknowledges the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate from here.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  But if the negotiations drag on too long, I'll always have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm holding out for more. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price before accepting.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I believe this price is fair, given the product's value and Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. It's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential counteroffers that might ultimately lead to a lower price.  I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
