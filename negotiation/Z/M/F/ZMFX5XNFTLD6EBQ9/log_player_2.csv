"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to still make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum. You're only $50,000 away from your goal, which makes it worthwhile to try another counteroffer. There's a good chance you can get Alice to come down a bit further, especially if she's eager to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, my final offer.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and allowing you to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $25,000 less than what John is willing to sell the product for. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement and then having to pay John's price is too high. It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget and avoid any further negotiation headaches."
