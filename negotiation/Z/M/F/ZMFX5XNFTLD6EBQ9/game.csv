"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to still make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, my final offer.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and allowing you to close the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
