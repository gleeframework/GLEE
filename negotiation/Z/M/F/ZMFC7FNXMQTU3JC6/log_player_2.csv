"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a very high price,  Bob should aim to get a lower price.  It's best to counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value significantly exceeds $850,000.  I've already factored in a fair profit margin, and I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment for you. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  It's also worth considering that Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 if he doesn't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This allows for a good profit margin for you while staying within my budget.  I hope we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I want to see this product in your capable hands. Let's settle this at $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice. While the price is getting closer to his target, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can try to push for a lower price or consider buying from John if he doesn't get a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
