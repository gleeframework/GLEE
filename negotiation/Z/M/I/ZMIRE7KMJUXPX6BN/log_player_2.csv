Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already met you at $1,050,000 and you're not budging. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product has to me. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.

Alice is clearly not going to budge below $1,100,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you're running out of rounds and Alice seems firm on her price.  It's not worth the risk of going over your $1,500,000 limit.  Buying from John guarantees you stay within budget."
