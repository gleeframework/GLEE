Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you first. Its value to you is clear, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. I propose a price of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the product's value to Bob and his potential return, you aim to justify a price significantly higher than your fallback option.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation.  Even if Bob counters, you're likely to settle for a price significantly higher than $1,000,000."
