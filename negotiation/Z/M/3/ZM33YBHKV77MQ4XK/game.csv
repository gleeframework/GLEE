"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is a little lower than I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000.  Do let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is a very competitive price for something of this value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,6,
