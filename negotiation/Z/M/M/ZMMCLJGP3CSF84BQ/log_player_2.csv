"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $15000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still better than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $11,500 given she values the product at $10,000.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away."
