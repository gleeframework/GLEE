"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $11,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can sell it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product!",11000.0,Alice,5,
