"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset worth at least $1,200,000 to both of us, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product from you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
