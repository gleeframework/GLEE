# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep.

Bob seems stuck on $1,200,000.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, or take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, to push Bob further."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,220,000. If this is not acceptable, I'll consider buying from John at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.

While I'd prefer the full $1,250,000, Bob is firm, and getting an extra $220,000 over John's offer is a good deal. It's time to close and secure the profit."
