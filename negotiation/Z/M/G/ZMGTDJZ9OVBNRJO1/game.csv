"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the value I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant value for you, and we can hopefully finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
