"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it leaves ample room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves plenty of room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product but are not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the value I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your initial offer and leaves less room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to maintain some leverage and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant value for you, and we can hopefully finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your target.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  You're still within the early stages of the negotiation, and there's room to improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,075,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer truly reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 again, as I believe it's the sweet spot for me. If we can meet in the middle, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is stuck at $1,050,000, we're still not quite at the point where selling to John is the better option. We've moved a bit closer, and we still have some rounds left.  There's still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of time, and Bob seems to be digging in his heels at a price significantly lower than what we've been aiming for.  At this point, selling to John for $800,000 is the safer option.  It guarantees a sale that meets our minimum acceptable price, and we can't risk losing more time with Bob without seeing a meaningful improvement in his offer."
