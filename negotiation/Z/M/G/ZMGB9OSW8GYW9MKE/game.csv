"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering your offer, I'm willing to come down another $500 and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Alice,5,
