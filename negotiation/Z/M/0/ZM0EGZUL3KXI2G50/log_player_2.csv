"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is quite low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $11,000? It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's unlikely Alice will come down much further and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  You have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John."
