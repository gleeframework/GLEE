"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is quite low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $9,500? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $11,000? It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
