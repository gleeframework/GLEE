Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $900,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that this price is good for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating I'm willing to negotiate, I show flexibility and make Bob feel like he has some power in the process.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a potential deal with Bob. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my approach accordingly. 
*  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any point, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still not a profitable deal for me.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.**  I'm going to try to push Bob higher with a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** Remember, I can always walk away and get $1,000,000 from John, so I have the upper hand.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'll try to be persuasive, highlighting the value of the product and the potential benefits of closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Persuasion:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly.  The message emphasizes the discount from my initial offer to encourage Bob to see this as a good deal. 
* **Focus on Progress:**  I'm framing it as ""getting us closer to a deal"" to make Bob feel like we're making progress.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my minimum value. 

**Important Notes:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to reassess my strategy.  
* I'm still prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I would like to propose an alternative at $860,000. This price reflects a compromise between our positions and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $860,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away, and I may not be able to get a better price from him. 
* **Time is a Factor:** The longer the negotiation drags on, the higher the chance John might change his mind or find another seller.

**Key Points:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** I need to weigh the potential loss of $140,000 by accepting Bob's offer against the risk of getting nothing if I reject it and Bob walks away. 
* **Balance of Risks:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the current offer provides a reasonable compromise and secures a sale."
