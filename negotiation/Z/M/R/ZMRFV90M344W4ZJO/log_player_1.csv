"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000.  Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but the price needs to work for me too. Would you consider $1,175,000? It's a significant move on my end to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still too far from my minimum. I'll continue negotiating to try and reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. Let's settle this.  How about $1,250,000?  It splits the difference and represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To show I'm serious, I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** $1,200,000 is a solid offer and represents a significant profit above my minimum. While I could push for more, Bob's stated this is his final offer, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away and potentially getting a lower offer from John."
