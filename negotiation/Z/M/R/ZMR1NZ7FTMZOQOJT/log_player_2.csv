Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the price I could get from John. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is becoming increasingly firm on her price, and it's clear she's aware of your alternative option (John).  She's now trying to inch the price *upward*. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price than John's $12,000. Cutting your losses and going with John ensures you get the product without the risk of the negotiation failing entirely in the last round."
