Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,190,000. I believe it presents significant value, even beyond your initial assessment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Reasonable:**  Offering the product just below your guaranteed price ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains a $10,000 advantage over the market value while you maximize your potential profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that the price is open for discussion, leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer with a slightly higher amount."
