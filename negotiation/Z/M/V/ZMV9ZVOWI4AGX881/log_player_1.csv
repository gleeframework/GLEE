Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $9,500 is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still offers him a potential ""deal"" if he values the product more than that or doesn't want to risk losing out.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, avoids potential delays involved with selling to John.

This strategy aims to balance the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for maximizing profit."
