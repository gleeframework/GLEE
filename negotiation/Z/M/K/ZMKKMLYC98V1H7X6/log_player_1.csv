Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm asking for $1,100,000, which reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim for a higher price with Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product for $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and encourage acceptance. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You can adjust the price slightly lower if you want to increase the chance of a quicker sale, but going much lower would significantly reduce your potential profit."
