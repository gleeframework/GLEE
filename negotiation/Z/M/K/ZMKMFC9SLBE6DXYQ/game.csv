"Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,600,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than that.  I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This takes into account the value it brings and allows us both to benefit.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
