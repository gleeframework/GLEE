"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident it will far exceed that price in return on investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I've given this product a lot of thought, and while I understand your perspective, I believe its true value is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the very bottom line of what the product is worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,600,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,400,000, but I'm not willing to go higher than that.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
