"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $120, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I think I can still do better. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.  I'm still above my minimum value, but I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum value of $120, Bob's offer of $92 is within a reasonable range.  Considering the limited rounds, it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk further negotiations and potentially losing the sale to John."
