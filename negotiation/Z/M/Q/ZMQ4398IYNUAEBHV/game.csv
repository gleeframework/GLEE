"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000 is the minimum I can accept, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer, as that's my absolute maximum budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum. How about we meet at $1300000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
