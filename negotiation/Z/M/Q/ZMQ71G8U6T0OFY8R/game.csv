"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $97.50. This way we both get a good deal.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're eager to make a deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $101? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly.  Let me know what you think.",101.0,Alice,5,
