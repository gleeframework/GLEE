"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
