"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. How about $900,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go below $900,000.  This product is incredibly valuable, and I know it will be a great asset to your business.  Let's compromise and meet in the middle. How about we settle on $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  However, I still need to make at least $900,000 on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $887,500? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Think about it, and let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",887500.0,Alice,7,
