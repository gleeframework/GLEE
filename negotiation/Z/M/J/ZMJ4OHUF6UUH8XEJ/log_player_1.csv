Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm holding out for a bit more.  I have 6 rounds left and I want to see if we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can get there."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go below $900,000.  This product is incredibly valuable, and I know it will be a great asset to your business.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left. I want to see if we can reach $900,000, but I'm also aware that I could sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll be ready to walk away if it seems like he's not willing to budge."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000. I've reached a point in the negotiations with Bob where I don't believe I can get him to budge any further. It's a tough decision because I would have liked to make a deal with Bob, but  $1,000,000 is my minimum and I'm not willing to go lower. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident this will be a smooth transaction."
