Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $150 is higher than your minimum of $100, giving you some room to negotiate downwards. 
* **It's not too high:**  Starting too high could scare Bob away immediately.  
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:**  This helps to build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than $100, you have room to negotiate further. You know the product is worth at least $100 to you, and it's likely Bob values it more than that given his willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $135? It's a fair price that reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses down. Could we possibly agree on $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. You've already rejected his previous offer and countered with $135, so this is a small compromise that still gets you a decent price. 

It's important to balance maximizing profit with avoiding the risk of losing the sale altogether.  You can always sell to John for $100, but it's better to get $125 from Bob if possible."
