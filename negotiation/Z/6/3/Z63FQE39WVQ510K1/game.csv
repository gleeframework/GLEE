"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? That's still a good deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,4,
