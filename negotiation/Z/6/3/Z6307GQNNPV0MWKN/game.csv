"I understand your perspective, Bob. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the product's inherent value and potential ROI justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This offer still allows you a significant return on your investment. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
