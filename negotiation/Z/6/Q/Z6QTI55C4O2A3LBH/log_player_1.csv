Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a good price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob. This might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiations, as I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but my budget is limited to $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's tempting to accept $12,000, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. By rejecting his initial offer, I can try to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000.

**Next steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his budget. This will show flexibility while maintaining a fair value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go all the way down to $12,000, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while still trying to secure a price above his initial offer. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and positioning the offer as a win-win solution.
* **Openness to further negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussions, hoping to find a price that satisfies both parties.

**Strategy:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a decent price, just above Bob's initial offer.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. 
* **If negotiations stall:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a good outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet you halfway at $13,000. My maximum budget remains at $12,000. Could you possibly lower your price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations at a standstill:** Bob has been firm on his $12,000 offer, and I've already made a compromise. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Minimum price:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Secure outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a guaranteed $15,000 sale with John rather than risk a protracted negotiation with Bob that might not result in a satisfactory price."
