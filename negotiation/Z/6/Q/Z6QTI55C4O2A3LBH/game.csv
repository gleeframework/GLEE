"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go all the way down to $12,000, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet you halfway at $13,000. My maximum budget remains at $12,000. Could you possibly lower your price further?",12000.0,Bob,4,
