"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're able to accept.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've gone down to $11,500, and now you're asking me to go down to $11,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11250.0,Alice,5,
