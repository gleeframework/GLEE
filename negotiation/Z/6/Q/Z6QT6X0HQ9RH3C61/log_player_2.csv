"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than Alice's value.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to your target, you're still able to negotiate further.  There's still a gap between your offer and Alice's. You can try to bridge that gap with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone down to $11,500, and now you're asking me to go down to $11,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've already negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal.  $11,250 is a good price, especially compared to John's $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer will save you a substantial amount of money."
