"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer and sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this product at a price that's still a great value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000. This is a very fair price considering your concessions and my maximum budget. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
