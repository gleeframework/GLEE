# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer and sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this product at a price that's still a great value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept, it's still higher than his maximum budget and he can likely get a better deal.  He should counteroffer again and see if he can get a price closer to his maximum."
