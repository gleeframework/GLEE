I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, giving me room to potentially profit.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money. This strategy balances risk and potential reward."
