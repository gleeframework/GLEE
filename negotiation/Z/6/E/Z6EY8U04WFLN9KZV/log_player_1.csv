Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  The ideal scenario is to find a price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 that Bob finds acceptable.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **Confidence, Not Desperation:**  The language suggests confidence in the product's value without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,250,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if needed.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to close the deal quickly, a more aggressive initial offer might be necessary. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price slightly to secure the deal with Bob if it's more advantageous than selling to John."
