"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $110 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $108?  That's closer to your price than my last offer, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  Let's try $110 again.  This is a really great product and I think you'd agree it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,5,
