Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and it's worth the same to me, starting high allows me to potentially capture some of the value Bob places on it. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more involved in the process and potentially leading to a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
