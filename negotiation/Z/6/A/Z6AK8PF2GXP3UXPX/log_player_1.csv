Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential to Bob, reinforcing why this is a price worth paying.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. There are other valid strategies, and the ""ideal"" offer might depend on additional factors like Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance."
