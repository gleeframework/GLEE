"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for as close to his maximum budget of $800,000 as possible.  Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It's important to note that Bob can always walk away and buy from John, so this counteroffer is a safe bet that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still not worth the risk. There is still potential for further negotiation with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate a lower price and hopefully get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's already rejected $950,000, and his budget is $800,000.  Offering $900,000 is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product, but still within a range he's comfortable with. This is also a significant price reduction from Alice's last offer, which may encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is now very close to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's still not ideal, the potential for further negotiation is limited. Continuing to reject and counteroffer could result in Alice walking away from the deal altogether.  It's more strategically advantageous for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price, as he still saves a considerable amount compared to Alice's initial asking price."
