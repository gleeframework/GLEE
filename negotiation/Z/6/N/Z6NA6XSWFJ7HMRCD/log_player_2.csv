"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling for, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($150).  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $105, which is a significant discount from her original price and also a good deal for me. This offer is still within my budget, and it leaves room for potential negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. It's closer to my limit, but I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. I believe there's still room for compromise, especially since her original offer was $120, and she lowered it by $5.  I'm not comfortable with buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, and it's still within my budget. I'm hoping this is a sweet spot for both of us, and Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $130. While this is less than what John is selling for, it is still getting close to my maximum.  I'm better off buying from John for $150 than continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk her increasing her price again.  At this point, my time and energy are worth more than trying to save another $20."
