"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000.  He knows he can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. While I'm interested, that price is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1075000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still better off buying from John for $1,000,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than John's offer. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, considering my other options. I'm happy to meet you at $1,025,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1060000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,060,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John and secure the product at the lowest possible price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to further delays and might not result in a lower price."
