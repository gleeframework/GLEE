"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer.  This allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There's no harm in seeing if Alice will lower her price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** A $3,000 reduction (20% off) shows you're serious about negotiating but not being unreasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The mention of finding a price that works for both of us subtly implies you think the product is valuable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $13500?  This gives us both some room to be happy with the outcome.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice's counteroffer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate, but there's still room to get a better price. 
* **Testing the waters:** By rejecting, I can see if Alice is willing to come down further.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting keeps me in control of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  A $500 reduction shows I'm taking Alice's counteroffer seriously, but I'm still pushing for a better deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  ""Fair compromise"" emphasizes that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Show Readiness:** ""Ready to make a deal"" conveys seriousness and encourages Alice to accept."
