Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $150, we can see how interested Bob really is. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, we can always fall back on our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to completely lowball him at the start. A starting price of $150 shows we value the product while still aiming for a profit."
