"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product for my needs. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $700000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $900000 for the product.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction, and I'm confident you'll find the value well worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for my needs.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
