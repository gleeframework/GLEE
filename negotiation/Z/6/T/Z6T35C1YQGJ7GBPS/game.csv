"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to consider purchasing for a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance between its worth and your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 is pushing it for me.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to make a substantial move to bridge the gap. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that last offer is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't make a deal at that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
