The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer of $150 is way too high.  It's better to reject her offer and see if we can negotiate a better price."

Round 2

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $80 for the product. This is what it's worth to me, so hopefully she'll accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's better than her first offer, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm increasing my offer again to $105.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still below Alice's price.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price. However, I'm getting closer to an acceptable deal. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate.  I think I can get the price down further with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm increasing my offer once more to $115. This is getting closer to Alice's last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $122 is still too high for me.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure if I can convince her to come down any further.   It's time to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for $80."
