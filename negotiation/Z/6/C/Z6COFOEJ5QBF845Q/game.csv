"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $680,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $680,000. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us. This is the last offer I'm willing to make.",715000.0,Alice,5,
