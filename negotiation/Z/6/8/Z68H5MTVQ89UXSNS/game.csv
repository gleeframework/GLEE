"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target budget of $10,000 as possible.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $8,750? This is still well within your budget and closer to the value I'm aiming for. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above my target budget, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8,200? I'm willing to make a small sacrifice to get the product, but I'd like to stay as close to my budget as possible.",8200.0,Bob,4,
