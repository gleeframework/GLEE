"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this is your final compromise, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that price. My absolute maximum is $780,000.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum price. I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $812,500. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",812500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting tough!  I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, anything above $800,000 is really pushing my limits. If you're willing to come down just a little more, I'm ready to close this deal today.  How about $795,000?",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $795,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of a price of $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,9,
