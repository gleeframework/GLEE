Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Flexibility:** By setting a price lower than my minimum, I can still negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer, while maintaining the possibility of a decent profit. 
* **Backup option:** Remember, John is always there as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $12,000 floor.  
* **Potential for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer.  While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? That's still a significant saving for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm emphasizing the ""significant saving"" for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations. 
* **Still above minimum:** The counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows for potential flexibility in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,000 is still below my desired price of $12,000, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **No guarantee with John:**  It's important to remember that my deal with John is not guaranteed.  He might not be available or might change his mind.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, I might not be able to get a better price from him.  He might walk away completely, leaving me with no buyer.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, potentially causing delays or the emergence of other buyers.

Given the above factors, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer at this point.  It's a decent deal, and it secures a sale without taking the risk of losing both buyers."
