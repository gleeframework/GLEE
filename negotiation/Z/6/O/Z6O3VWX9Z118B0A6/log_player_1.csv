Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate down from $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's not a ""take it or leave it"" offer, allowing for potential counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
