"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this exceptional product. I'm willing to let you have it for $900,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,000,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to come down further."
