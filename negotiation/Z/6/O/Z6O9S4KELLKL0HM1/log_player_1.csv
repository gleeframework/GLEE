Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value ($15,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be open-ended.  It doesn't pressure Bob but invites a response and a potential counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
