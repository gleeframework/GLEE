Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $90 is a decent compromise and ensures I make a profit.  I'd rather secure a deal now than risk further negotiation or losing the opportunity to sell to John."
