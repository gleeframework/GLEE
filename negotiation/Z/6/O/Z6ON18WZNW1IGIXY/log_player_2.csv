# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still too high.  You can try to get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $87.50 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to get a lower price.  You're still within your budget, and it's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $87.50 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $86.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $87.50 is still a bit high for you. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $86.25. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You're getting the product for $86.25, which is within your budget and a good deal.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice, and John is selling the product for $100."
