I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a profit above my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000 if possible. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable value.  This shows flexibility but also emphasizes that I'm not willing to go any lower."
