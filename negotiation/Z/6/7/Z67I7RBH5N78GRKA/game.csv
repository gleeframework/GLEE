"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could we settle at $1,150,000?  This seems like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $1,150,000 is cutting it too close. How about we make it $1,300,000 and close the deal?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we are getting close!  I'd be happy to agree to $1,225,000 to finalize everything.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
