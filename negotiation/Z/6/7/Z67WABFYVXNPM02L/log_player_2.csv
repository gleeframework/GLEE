"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,500,000 is a better option as it stays within Bob's budget."
