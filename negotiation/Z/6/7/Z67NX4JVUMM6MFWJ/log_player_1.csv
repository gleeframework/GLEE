Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than Bob's perceived value but still less than my minimum. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation"", I'm signaling to Bob that a deal is possible without revealing my minimum.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me confidence to negotiate confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000, making it worth it to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's offer:** I'm raising my price slightly to $9,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $9,000 is a fair price.
* **Open to agreement:**  I again state my willingness to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is becoming tedious:**  Bob's offers are not significantly increasing, suggesting further negotiation might not lead to a better outcome.
* **John guarantees a good deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is a significantly better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

It's better to end the negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit from selling to John."
