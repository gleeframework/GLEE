Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is considerably below what I had in mind.

This represents a substantial reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,600,000? This allows me to acknowledge your engagement while still achieving a price that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
