Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth, the message hints at its value, which might make Bob more amenable to the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying other buyers exist), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a good margin to work with since your minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
