Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" aims to make the price seem reasonable to Bob.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing our profit. If Bob rejects the offer, we have the safety net of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
