"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit.  $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above my minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps me understand how badly Bob wants the product and sets the tone for the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to $1,200,000 yet.  I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm splitting the difference between his offer and my previous ask, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested but negotiating cautiously. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target.  We're getting into the later rounds, so I'll make a smaller concession this time to signal I'm reaching my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about $1,275,000?  This is a very competitive offer, considering the value this product brings."",
 ""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:**  By round 5, I'm introducing a bit of urgency to nudge the negotiation towards a close.
* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm only coming down $25,000, signaling that I'm getting close to my bottom line. 
* **Final Offer Tone:** While not stating it explicitly, I'm framing this offer in a way that suggests it might be one of my last moves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $1,225,000 is my absolute limit. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to push for a bit more, the potential gains are getting smaller, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing. 
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $1,225,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available sooner for other opportunities.  

Bob has set a firm limit, and while I'm confident in the product's value, the difference isn't worth the risk of prolonged negotiation."
