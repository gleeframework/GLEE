"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14000.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to accept $12,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $12000 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and that price is still fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $13,000 is still a good price for Bob, significantly lower than John's $15,000.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or sticking to her price. 
* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so $13,000 is a good deal.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to ensure a purchase while still saving money."
