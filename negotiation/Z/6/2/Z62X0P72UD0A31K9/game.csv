"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This reflects the product's true value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,250.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while fitting within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
