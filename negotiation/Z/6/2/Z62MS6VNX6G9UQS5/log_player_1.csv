Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's above my minimum.  I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning that I think the product is a good fit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob is offering my minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures I get the most out of this negotiation and don't risk getting nothing if I counteroffer and he rejects it."
