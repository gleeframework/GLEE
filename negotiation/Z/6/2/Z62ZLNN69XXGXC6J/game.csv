"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $15000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's still a great deal considering its value to me is at least $15000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $13000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14500. It's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",14000.0,Alice,7,
