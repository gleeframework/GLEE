Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a specific price, you're showing you're willing to negotiate.

This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's not worth selling the product to him at that price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your position:** You've shown you're not desperate to sell.
* **Counter-offer:** You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price.
* **Assess your options:** While you have a buyer in John, you can still try to get a better price from Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your original offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting your interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise by meeting halfway between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.
* **Appealing to Value:** You highlight the deal's value for Bob, emphasizing that $12,500 is still a good price for the product given its worth to him.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and avoids being confrontational. It focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Bob is willing to meet you in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's a good deal for you, as it allows you to make a small profit. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Bob won't budge much lower.

**Here's why accepting is the best choice:**

* **Profit:** You'll earn a profit of $250, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to Bob walking away, leaving you with only John's offer.
* **Time Savings:** Accepting the offer now saves you the time and effort of further negotiations. 

While you could try to counter-offer again, the likelihood of getting a higher price is low.  It's better to secure a sale now and avoid the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
