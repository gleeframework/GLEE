Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I wanted to give you a chance to own it before I make it available to others."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her asking price while still being profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice leverage. She can be slightly more aggressive with her offer to Bob.

By offering the product just below her guaranteed selling price to John, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously."
