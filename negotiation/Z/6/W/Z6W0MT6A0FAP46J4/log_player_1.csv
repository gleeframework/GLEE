Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth, justifying the higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:** Subtly reminding Bob that she has other options (""before I list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and opportunity. 

While Bob values the product at $12,000, Alice doesn't know this. By offering it at $15,000, she leaves room for:

* **Bob accepting outright:** If Bob is eager or places a higher value on the speed of the transaction, he might accept.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob can counter-offer, and they can arrive at a price that's beneficial for both. 

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
