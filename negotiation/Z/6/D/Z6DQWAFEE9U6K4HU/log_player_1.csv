Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000 but still leaves me with a profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing his potential gain. This might make him more likely to accept.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows for potential negotiation. It's high enough to make it worthwhile for Bob to consider, but it also leaves room for me to lower the price slightly if necessary.  If Bob rejects, I can counter with a lower price, always keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also well below the value of the product to me.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the Offer:**  It's important to establish a baseline for negotiations.  Accepting this low offer would significantly reduce my profits.
* **Counter-Offer:**  I'll make a counter-offer to Bob in the next round.  I'll start with a price that is closer to my desired range but still leaves room for further negotiation.  
* **Backup Option:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 in mind, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $600,000 is far too low.  I understand you want a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a great price for a product worth $800,000 to you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still much closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging that Bob wants a good deal but emphasizing that my offer is still fair, considering the product's value to him.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It shows flexibility on my part while maintaining a price that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could do $700,000.  That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is an increase from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a much higher amount.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the Offer:** I'm rejecting this offer to maintain my negotiating position.  
* **Counter-Offer:** I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll try to find a middle ground while still ensuring I make a substantial profit.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, which provides me with a strong leverage point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is simply not viable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal but emphasizing that I'm also making a significant concession.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I make a decent profit. It's a calculated risk, as Bob could still reject, but it increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate whether to continue negotiations or sell to John for $1,500,000."
