Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $600,000 is far too low.  I understand you want a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a great price for a product worth $800,000 to you. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is simply not viable for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's aiming for a price well above your maximum. John's offer of $800,000 is your best bet at this point."
