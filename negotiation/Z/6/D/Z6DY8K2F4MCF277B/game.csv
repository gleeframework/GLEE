"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to buy from John for $80 if we can't reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
