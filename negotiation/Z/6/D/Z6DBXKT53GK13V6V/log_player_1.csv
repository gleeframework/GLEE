"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds and can still make a good profit selling to John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to drop my price significantly just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. With 6 rounds remaining and the ability to sell to John for a much higher price, I'm not willing to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to close a deal. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. I've made significant concessions, but Bob still seems unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and I'm confident that I can get a better price with him in the future."
