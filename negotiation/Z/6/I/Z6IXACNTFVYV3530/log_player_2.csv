"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1000000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense value for someone like you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 and John is also selling the product for that price, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can save money by rejecting and buying from John."
