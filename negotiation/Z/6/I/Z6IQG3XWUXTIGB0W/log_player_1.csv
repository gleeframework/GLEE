"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering my price slightly but still holding firm on a value greater than Bob's initial offer. I believe this demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm aware that John is a solid backup option, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm continuing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get him to go a little higher before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1140000}

I'm going to raise the price slightly, but only by a small amount. I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
