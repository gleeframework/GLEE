Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $11,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it's still attractive compared to you selling it to John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly pressure Bob to act quickly and potentially secure what he might perceive as a deal."
