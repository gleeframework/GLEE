"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a little less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
