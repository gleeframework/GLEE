{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving me the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** The starting price is above my minimum value of $150, so I'm not risking a loss.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If negotiations stall, I can always switch to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find a buyer quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, potentially leading to a more favorable counteroffer from him.
* **Safeguard My Minimum:** Selling to John is always an option, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation. 

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $105. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm again using positive language (""great deal"", ""fair price"") to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Strategic Midpoint:** $105 is a reasonable midpoint, giving both of us a sense of progress. 
* **Maintain Negotiation Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid having to switch to John, which would be less profitable.

**Next Step:**

* If Bob accepts the counteroffer, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects the counteroffer, I'll analyze his new counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* If negotiations stall again, I will move to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my desired price, but it's very close to my minimum of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might go with John, and I'd be stuck with my minimum.
* **Potential for Future Negotiation:** Even if I accept this offer, there's a possibility that I might be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the future if I build a good relationship with him. 

**Next Step:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $95. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent outcome and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
