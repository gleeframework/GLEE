Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I need to ensure it makes financial sense for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and she's stated it's her final offer.  While getting the product for a bit less than $850,000 would be ideal, it's not worth the risk of Alice sticking to her final offer and losing the opportunity to buy it from John for $800,000."
