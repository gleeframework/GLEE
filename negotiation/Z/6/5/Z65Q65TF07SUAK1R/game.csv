"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is far too low. This product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm sticking to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $950,000 is still below the value you'll gain from this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow you to maximize your return.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $990,000.  How about we settle on $995,000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows you to make a good return. Let's make a deal!",995000.0,Alice,7,
