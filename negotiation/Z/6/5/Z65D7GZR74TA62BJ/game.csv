"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make, but I hope you can understand that I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1800000. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
