"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This price is fair considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.",875000.0,Alice,3,
