Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** This ensures I'm still making a profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It states the offer and encourages a response from Bob. 

I'm prepared to negotiate further, but if the negotiations stall, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $800,000 is still a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher sale price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer. There's a good chance I can convince him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises slightly:**  It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Is still above Bob's offer:** This creates a small gap for further negotiation, potentially leading to a win-win scenario.
* **Maintains a clear message:** It reiterates the offer and emphasizes the value proposition. 

I'm still open to finding a solution that benefits both of us, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can find common ground. How about we aim for $825,000? This would allow us to strike a fair deal while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. I'm comfortable with this deal, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can still make a decent profit with this deal."
