"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is way above his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, could you consider $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and your desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000.  This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

While $14,000 is a better offer than before, it's still over Bob's budget. At this point, Bob has negotiated enough, and it's better for him to simply buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
