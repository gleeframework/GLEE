"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it can be extremely valuable for your business.  I'm asking $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value our ongoing conversation and appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $775,000 simply isn't enough for me to let it go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $825,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $825,000. Would you consider $790,000?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $790,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to make one more concession and come down to $810,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in this product once you have it.  Let's make this deal happen!",810000.0,Alice,7,
