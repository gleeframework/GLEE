"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer of $100 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($80) and John's offer ($80). Rejecting this offer gives you room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This is a strategic move to:
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility.
    * Leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses interest while clearly stating your budget constraints.  This approach aims to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her offer of $85 is still above your maximum price and what John is offering. You have room to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $70? That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** Instead of jumping straight to your maximum of $80, offering $70 keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Justification:** You're reiterating your budget constraints, subtly reminding Alice that you have other options (John) without explicitly threatening to walk away. 
* **Positive Tone:** You're maintaining a polite and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $80. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price!  There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as you've achieved the best possible outcome â€“ getting the product at the price you were willing to pay."
