"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $7500 is simply too far below the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  This would give us both a good deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $7500. This is my final offer, as I'm confident that you'll find it's a fair price for the value it delivers.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $7500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. Can you consider $6800? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible.",6800.0,Bob,6,
