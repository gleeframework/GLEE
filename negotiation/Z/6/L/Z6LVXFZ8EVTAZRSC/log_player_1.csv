``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $7500 is simply too far below the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 4

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $7,500.
