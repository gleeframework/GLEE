"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $7500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7500 is a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7800? I think it's a fair compromise.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8000. That's my absolute bottom line, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
