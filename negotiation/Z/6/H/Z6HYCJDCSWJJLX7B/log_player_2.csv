"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1250000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as you've indicated a willingness to pay $1000000. Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price point that benefits both of us. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the initial $1,000,000 he was willing to pay, he can still get the product for that price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal strategy."
