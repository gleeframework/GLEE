"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
