,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for this product.  This reflects its value to me while giving you a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This allows for a good profit for you while staying within my financial limits. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,050,000 to get this deal done. This offer reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  I believe this product will be a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 remains outside my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay within my financial limits.  To close this deal, I'm offering $900,000. This price represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,
