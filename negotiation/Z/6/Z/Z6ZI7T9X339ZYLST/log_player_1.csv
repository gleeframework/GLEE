"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value to make the high price more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at my willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for this product.  This reflects its value to me while giving you a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's indicated his maximum, there's likely still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, showing Bob flexibility and a genuine interest in reaching a deal.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  This keeps the negotiation alive while signaling I'm not willing to settle for a price far below my valuation.
* **Justification:**  I'm reinforcing the product's value while acknowledging Bob's position, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This allows for a good profit for you while staying within my financial limits. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $850,000, but I still have some negotiating room before I need to accept John's offer. It's becoming clearer that Bob might not be willing to go much higher. However, I'll use the next round to make a smaller concession and see if I can draw him up slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,050,000 to get this deal done. This offer reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  I believe this product will be a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($50,000) to signal I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution and reinforces the product's value to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** As the rounds progress, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, hoping to encourage Bob to move closer to my asking price.
* **Backup Option:** I'm still above John's $1,000,000 offer, but I need to be mindful that Bob might not budge much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 remains outside my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay within my financial limits.  To close this deal, I'm offering $900,000. This price represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has significantly increased his offer from his initial $850,000, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a good profit."
