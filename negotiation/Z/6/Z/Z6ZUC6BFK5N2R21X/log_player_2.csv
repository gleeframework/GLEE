Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $12000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to sell at $10000. I'll offer you a price of $10500.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're very close. I understand you're not willing to go lower than $10,500, but I'm still only able to offer $10,000. It's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John."", ""product_price"": 10000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $10000. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll offer you a price of $10200.
