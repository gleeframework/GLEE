"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiation room. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go.  It's also important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can get more. I'll counter with a higher offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I want to show flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my desired range and is a good deal considering I have the option to sell to John for $15,000. It's a good middle ground and a solid profit for me. I'm going to accept his offer."
