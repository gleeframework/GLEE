I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  I've reached the final round of negotiations with Bob, and while his offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. It's better to secure the guaranteed higher price from John than to risk losing out on a higher offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
