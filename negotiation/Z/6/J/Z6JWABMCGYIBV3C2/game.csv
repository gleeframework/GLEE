"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but unfortunately, $1,065,000 simply isn't enough for me at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,072,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1072500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer.  How about we settle on $1,070,000?
