"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire this incredible product, which holds immense value to me. My initial offer is $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a high price ($2,000,000) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I highlight the product's importance to me, subtly suggesting it could be even more valuable to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I don't set an ultimatum, giving Bob space to counter. 

**Strategy:**

By opening high, I create the impression that the product is truly valuable. This sets a strong starting point for negotiations and allows for flexibility as the rounds progress.  I'll observe Bob's reaction to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm holding out for a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'll aim for a price that reflects the product's value to me while acknowledging that some negotiation is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,400,000 is tempting, it's a bit below my desired value for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  It's a fair price that still allows me to meet my minimum while offering you a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I show that I understand Bob's position and appreciate his willingness to negotiate.
* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm proposing a midpoint price of $1,700,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** I subtly remind Bob that this is a fair price, implying the product's worth. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to push Bob closer to my desired value while maintaining a friendly tone.  I'm hoping this compromise will appeal to Bob's desire for a deal and encourage him to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1550000, which is closer to my target price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This is a good deal for me, especially considering that I have limited rounds left. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable value. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price in the next round, there's a risk that Bob might become less willing to negotiate, or I might have to sell to John for a lower price."
