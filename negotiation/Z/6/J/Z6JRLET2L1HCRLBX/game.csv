"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1400000 is tempting, it's a bit below my desired value for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1700000?  It's a fair price that still allows me to meet my minimum while offering you a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1550000, which is closer to my target price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
