"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 

It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with buying from John."
