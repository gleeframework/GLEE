I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good compromise: 

* It's higher than my minimum price of $80, so I'm making a profit.
* It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, so he might be willing to accept the deal.

If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
