"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $95. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $105? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
