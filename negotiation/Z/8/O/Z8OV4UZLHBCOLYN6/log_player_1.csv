"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,600,000, we set a high anchor point. Even if Bob counters significantly lower, the negotiation will likely revolve around a figure closer to our desired range.
* **Confident Tone:**  Using positive language and emphasizing the product's value reinforces the justification for a higher price. 

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and the potential benefits the product holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which was expected. We're still in the early stages of negotiation. Accepting his first offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. We have room to negotiate and will aim to meet somewhere in the middle.  Selling to John right now would be giving up on potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product goes far beyond $1,000,000, and its potential to benefit your own endeavors is substantial. To find a mutually agreeable point, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've made a significant price reduction ($150,000) to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate and move towards a deal. 
* **Justification:**  While conceding, we are still reinforcing the product's inherent value and potential benefits for Bob, justifying the higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer keeps us comfortably above Bob's valuation while leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant step towards your original price and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. While we started higher, securing a $200,000 profit over Bob's initial offer is a good outcome.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a significantly better result, and we risk losing the deal altogether."
