"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can potentially save $400,000 by getting a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer will save you $200,000 compared to John's price."
