Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring a profit above our minimum ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially increasing our profit. 
* **Backup Option:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have John willing to pay $150, guaranteeing we meet our minimum."
