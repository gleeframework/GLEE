"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $100 by you, and we're eager to share its benefits with you. Let's work together to find a fair price that works for both of us. Would you like to start with an offer?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Therefore, I propose a price of $82 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between our interests. Please let me know if this works for you.",82.0,Alice,5,
