"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
