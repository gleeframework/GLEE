Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you are still making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still negotiate further.

Remember, you have the option to go to John at any time if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price.  While it's tempting to take the $1,250,000, you have a better option. You can reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to your desired $1,400,000. You might be able to reach a compromise that benefits both of you.

Here's why it's better to reject Bob's offer:

* **You have a better alternative:** You can sell to John for $1,500,000 if you don't reach a deal with Bob.
* **You can still negotiate:** Rejecting the offer doesn't mean you can't work with Bob. You can counter with a price that's more favorable to you.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage in the negotiation and have the potential to earn a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It is higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer.  This demonstrates you are willing to negotiate and meet halfway. You're also reminding Bob of the product's value to keep the pressure on. 

**Remember:** If Bob still rejects this offer, you can choose to either:

* **Counter again:** You can try to meet Bob closer to his price.
* **Sell to John:** You can always go with John's offer of $1,500,000."
