Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That feels like a fair deal to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $120.  Buying from John at $100 is the best option for staying within budget."
