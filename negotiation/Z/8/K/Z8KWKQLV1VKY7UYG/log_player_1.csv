Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is far too low for me, considering my minimum is $150.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  I can get a guaranteed $150 from John, and I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 130}
