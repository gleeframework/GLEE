"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",775000.0,Bob,4,
