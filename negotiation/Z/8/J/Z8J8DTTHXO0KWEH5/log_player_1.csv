Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my ideal price.  I'm going to accept and close the deal."
