Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below that is pointless. Offering it at exactly $1,200,000 leaves no room for negotiation and Bob might balk.  The offer of $1,150,000:
    * Gives Bob a potential gain (if he values it even slightly higher than $1,000,000 in practice).
    * Earns you a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while still having the safety net of John's offer."
