"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as much as I can for the product.  I believe it's worth at least $2,000,000 to me, so this price reflects that.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I don't know Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$800,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still staying significantly above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this price will be enticing enough for Bob to consider, but also that it's still within a range that's reasonable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $1,550,000. This is still above my minimum value, but I'm getting close to the point where I'm comfortable selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum value.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer or running out of time completely.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
