"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and I believe it has the potential to really benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.  You're better off rejecting the offer and buying from John, even though it's a higher price, as it still fits within your budget."
