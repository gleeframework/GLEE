Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $2,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000.

Bob is moving closer to my initial offer, and while I could push for more, $2,050,000 is a significant profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation falling apart later."
