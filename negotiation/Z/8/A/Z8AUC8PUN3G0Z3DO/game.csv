"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your price is tempting, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $850,000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to you. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to you. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000 again, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
