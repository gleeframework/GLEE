# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, you know you have John as a backup option. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price, potentially saving you even more money. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
