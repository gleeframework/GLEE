"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Given the product's value and my opportunity cost, I'd be willing to accept $950,000.  This price is still fair, given its worth to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price, allowing us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
