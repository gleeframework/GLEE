"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, reflecting its unique value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, Alice is asking for $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  Rejecting allows Bob to propose a lower price, potentially saving him more money. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  This option ensures Bob can get the product, but it's more expensive than negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Given the product's value and my opportunity cost, I'd be willing to accept $950,000.  This price is still fair, given its worth to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lowered from $1,000,000, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **More room for negotiation.**  Bob can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  Bob can still choose to buy from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
