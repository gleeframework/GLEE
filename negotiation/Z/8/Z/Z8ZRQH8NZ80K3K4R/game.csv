"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we settle at $10,000? I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",10000.0,Alice,5,
