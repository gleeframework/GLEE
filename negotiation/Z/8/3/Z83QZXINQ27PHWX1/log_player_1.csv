Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents a fair price for its value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17,000. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher and it's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price."
