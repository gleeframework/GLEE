"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a product that I think Bob will like, which might make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal, but still below his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident this product is worth it for both of us at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $95 is a good deal considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of him walking away.  It's also closer to my ideal price than John's offer."
