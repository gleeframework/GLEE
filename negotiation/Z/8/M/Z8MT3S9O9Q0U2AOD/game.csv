"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $825,000, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves us both with a profit margin. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting close, but $920,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",880000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $880,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is our last chance to make a deal. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with John's offer.",890000.0,Bob,10,
