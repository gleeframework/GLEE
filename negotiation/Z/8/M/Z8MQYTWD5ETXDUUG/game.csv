"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1500000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I value your offer, $1200000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
