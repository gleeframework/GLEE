"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its true worth.  Consider it carefully, as I'm confident another buyer will be happy to purchase it for full price if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,200,000) is significantly higher than your maximum budget ($800,000). 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 
* While Alice claims the product's value is much higher, her offer doesn't align with your budget.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you have a good fallback option with John."
