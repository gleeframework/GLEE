# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  If you decide not to buy it, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,500,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
