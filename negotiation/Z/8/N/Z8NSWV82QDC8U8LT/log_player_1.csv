Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Starting High:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" creates a sense of demand and justifies the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this initial offer.  However, since you have a fallback option (John), it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $2,000."
