"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $13,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. I believe that reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a stretch.  My absolute maximum is $14,000.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal. ",14000.0,Bob,6,
