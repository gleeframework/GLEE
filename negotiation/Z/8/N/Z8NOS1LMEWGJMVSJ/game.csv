"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at a price close to what I value the product at. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my valuation.  What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,362,500. This is slightly higher than my previous proposal and closer to your latest offer. I believe this could be a fair solution for both of us.",1362500.0,Bob,4,
