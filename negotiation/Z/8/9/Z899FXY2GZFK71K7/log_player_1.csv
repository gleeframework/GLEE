Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering our respective valuations. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's aim to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
