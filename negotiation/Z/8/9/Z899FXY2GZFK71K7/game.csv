"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering our respective valuations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a considerable return on investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's aim to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
