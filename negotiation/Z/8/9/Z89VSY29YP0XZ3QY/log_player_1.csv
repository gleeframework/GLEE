Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $10,000 is less than the product's value to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially get closer to your desired price if Bob counteroffers.

It's important to remember that you can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  This is especially true since you know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is just too low for me. Considering the product is worth $12,000 to you, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. I'm trying to save as much as I can, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than your minimum of $8,000 and only $250 less than your last counteroffer.  It's a good deal that allows you to get a good price for the product without risking losing the sale."
