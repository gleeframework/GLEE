"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price. I'm willing to make a significant offer just for you. Would you consider purchasing this for $1,300,000? This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I'd be paying $1,300,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000, I'd rather reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
