Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price. I'm willing to make a significant offer just for you. Would you consider purchasing this for $1,300,000? This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, getting Bob to buy it at a higher price means more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might make him suspicious or undervalue the product. Aiming for a price above his perceived value but below John's guaranteed purchase price creates a win-win potential.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers adds a time pressure element, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
