"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'd need at least $13,750 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $13,750. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $13,500 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. It's important to remember that negotiations are a back-and-forth process, and sometimes it's better to secure a good deal than to hold out for an ideal one, especially when there is a risk of losing the sale entirely."
