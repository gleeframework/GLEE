"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum acceptable value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best possible price, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $750,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $850,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to move closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this work.",850000.0,Alice,5,
