"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $120 right now. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to do $135? That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both some wiggle room.",135.0,Bob,4,
