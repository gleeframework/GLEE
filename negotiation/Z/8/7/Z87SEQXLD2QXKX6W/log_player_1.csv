"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $9,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $9,500, but that's really the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear Bob is unlikely to reach the $12,000 mark. It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
