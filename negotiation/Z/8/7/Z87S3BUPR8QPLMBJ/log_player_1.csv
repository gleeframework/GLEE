Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Therefore, you should aim higher than $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you.
* **Strategic Wording:**  The message hints at the product's value and the possibility of others being interested (""before I list it publicly""). This creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher to give yourself more bargaining room.
* **Market Demand:** While you have John as a backup, consider if there's potential for even higher offers from others if you explored the market further."
