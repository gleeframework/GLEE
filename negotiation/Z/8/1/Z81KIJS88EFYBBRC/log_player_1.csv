"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth at least $15,000 to me and $15,000 to Bob. I believe there is room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. It's too low, considering the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,500. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my value for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $15,500. This is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $14,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling the product below my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price significantly below my minimum.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $14,500. This is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is just above my minimum value. If he rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my value for the product. It seems like further negotiation with Bob will be unproductive.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
