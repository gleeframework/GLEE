# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  $12,000 is still too high given that Bob's maximum is $15,000 and the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is better than her previous offer, it's still higher than he'd like to pay. He should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his desired price."
