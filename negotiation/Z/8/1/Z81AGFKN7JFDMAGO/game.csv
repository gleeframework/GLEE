"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $9,500 is tempting,  I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase today.",10000.0,Bob,4,
