{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly above my minimum price of $8,000, and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value for Bob:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also securing a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially closer to my initial $12,000 offer.
* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, making further negotiation worthwhile.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and aim for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $9,500 is tempting,  I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** $10,500 sits between my initial $12,000 offer and Bob's $9,500. It offers a compromise that could be agreeable to both of us.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price still provides a decent profit margin for me while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more than John.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone, demonstrating my willingness to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $10,000 is a good deal, considering my minimum price is $8,000. It's a reasonable profit margin and secures a quick sale.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even Bob backing out altogether.
* **Finality:** Bob's offer suggests he's ready to finalize the deal, making it a good opportunity to close. 

While I could try to push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit without risking losing the deal altogether."
