Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This takes into account the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's keep the conversation going.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, that price is still a little too high for me.  I could go up to $900,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, recognizing the value this product brings. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but to be completely transparent, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of what I'm offering. I've already made significant concessions to find a compromise. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000 as my absolute lowest price.  This is a firm offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's unlikely to go below $1,500,000.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
