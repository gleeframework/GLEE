"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick off our negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. This figure reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That initial price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This takes into account the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's keep the conversation going.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, that price is still a little too high for me.  I could go up to $900,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, recognizing the value this product brings. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but to be completely transparent, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of what I'm offering. I've already made significant concessions to find a compromise. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000 as my absolute lowest price.  This is a firm offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
