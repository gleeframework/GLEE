Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's lower than your minimum price:**  This leaves some room for you to accept a counteroffer that is still profitable. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This makes the offer seem fair to Bob, increasing the chance of acceptance.

If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new price. If the negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I'll switch to selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $150, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price to try and reach a mutually agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $135?  That's a good middle ground and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm countering with $135. This is still a good price for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're still looking for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my budget. I can do $132, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting very close to my minimum.  Further negotiation could continue, but it's likely to be time-consuming and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit that's still above my minimum acceptable price."
