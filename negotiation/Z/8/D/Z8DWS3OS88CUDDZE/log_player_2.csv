"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I propose a starting price of $950,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $950,000 is still too high, and he can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering your value for the product is $800,000, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I value your interest in this product.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $910,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial offer while still acknowledging the true value of this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer.  While closer to his desired price, $910,000 is still too high. He can likely get a better deal with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $910,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $880,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us working together to find a solution. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $895,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and balanced deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price with continued negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too great.  $895,000 is a good price, and accepting it ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and saves time."
