Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly below Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,150,000 is a significant amount, but it's still a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly acknowledges the possibility of negotiation, setting the stage for further discussion.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This gives me a floor price for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my floor price, it's still significantly below my desired outcome.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial rejection suggests he's willing to pay closer to $1,150,000.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a loss for me, as I value the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Next Round:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and provides a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Fair Deal:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair deal"" for both parties, building trust and encouraging Bob to consider my offer.
* **Finality:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, so I may not be willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  I can tell we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my desired outcome. It's only $25,000 below my initial offer and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, continuing negotiations might risk losing Bob completely.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation process takes time and increases the risk that Bob might back out or find another seller. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point, as it minimizes the potential loss compared to selling to John."
