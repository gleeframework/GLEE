Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a good deal for Bob:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, making it tempting for him to accept.
* **Maximizes your profit:** The price is above your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have space to lower the price slightly if necessary."
