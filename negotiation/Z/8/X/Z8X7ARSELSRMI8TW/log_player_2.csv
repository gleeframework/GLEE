You have three options:

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I like your idea of meeting in the middle, $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about $150 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $150, and it's not worth the risk of her going higher in a counteroffer.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
