"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I value your offer, $15,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let me know if you're open to that.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe $15,000 is a fair price for this product. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $15,500?",15500.0,Bob,4,
