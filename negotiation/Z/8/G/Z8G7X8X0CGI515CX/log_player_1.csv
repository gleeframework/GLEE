{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above your minimum value but still within a range Bob might be willing to accept.  I'm  keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $15,000 for it. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm hoping to squeeze a little more out of the negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I value your offer, $15,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe $15,000 is a fair price for this product. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is higher than John's offer of $15,000 and it's very close to my desired value.  It's time to lock in this deal."
