"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to accommodate your budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $825,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to keep the deal moving forward. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit more of a stretch than I'd like.  Would you consider $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. How about we try $775,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to keep the deal moving forward. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
