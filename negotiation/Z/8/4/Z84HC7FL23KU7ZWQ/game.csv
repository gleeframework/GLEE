"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,350,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I am still aiming to keep my investment within my specified budget. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $1,362,500? This would allow for a fair compromise between our interests.",1362500.0,Bob,4,
