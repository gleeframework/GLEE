,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $950,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm motivated to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle at $987,500. This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, and we're getting closer.  How about $962,500?  That's a good midpoint between our last offers, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly aiming for a fair deal, and I respect that.  However, I need to hold firm at a price that reflects the true value of this product. My final offer is $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the benefits you'll gain.",975000.0,Alice,7,
