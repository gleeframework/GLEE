# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a compromise while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $950,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm motivated to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle at $987,500. This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $987,500 is a good price, I believe I can still get it lower.  It's worth risking another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, and we're getting closer.  How about $962,500?  That's a good midpoint between our last offers, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 962500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly aiming for a fair deal, and I respect that.  However, I need to hold firm at a price that reflects the true value of this product. My final offer is $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has clearly reached her limit.  While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting her final offer of $975,000 is a good deal for me.  It's lower than John's offer, and I'm getting a product worth $1,200,000 to Alice."
