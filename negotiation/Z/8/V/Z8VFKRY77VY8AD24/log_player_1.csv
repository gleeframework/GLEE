"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try and push for something closer to my initial offer.  I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to accept. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly better price. I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if we can reach a compromise.  I'm going to try and counter with something in between his last offer and my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, I think I can still do better, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation. I'm going to counter with something closer to my last offer.  I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. It's a compromise, meeting him halfway from my last offer. This is getting close to my minimum, but I still believe there's a chance he'll accept. With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  He's clearly not willing to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale completely. Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I at least get my minimum value."
