# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $120 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$120 is too much, but Alice might be willing to negotiate. Let's try a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

$110 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay, but it's a good deal considering I can get it for $150 from John.  I'll take it."
