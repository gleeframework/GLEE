"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
