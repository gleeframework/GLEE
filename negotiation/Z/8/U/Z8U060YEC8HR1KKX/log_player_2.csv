"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance your business operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than its production cost. Considering its worth to you, let me propose an initial price of $10000 for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To try to accommodate your needs while still ensuring a fair return for us, I would like to counteroffer at $9000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for both of us and could be beneficial for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to his target price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has more rounds to work with, and it's worth attempting to secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price. To further explore a mutually beneficial solution, I am proposing a counteroffer at $8900 for the product. This price aims to balance our interests and could lead to a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John for the product. Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially get the product at a lower price, closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down on the price. However, $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident that $8,800 is a fair price that works for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 8800}
