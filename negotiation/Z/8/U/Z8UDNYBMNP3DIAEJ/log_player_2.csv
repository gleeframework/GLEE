"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer.  I should make a counteroffer significantly lower, hoping Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is my best offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, but it's still above my ideal price and what John offers.  I'll counteroffer again, trying to meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I'm able to offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're still interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and her final offer is still a significant markup from John's price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John at the price I know I can get."
