"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is my best offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I'm able to offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're still interested, please let me know.",11500.0,Alice,5,
