"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low,  but I'm willing to negotiate further.  I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate further before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm prepared to drop the price to $15,500. This is a significant price reduction, but it's the best I can do while still getting a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still slightly higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

This is a good offer for me, considering my minimum price and that I only have 4 rounds left. It's time to close the deal and move on."
