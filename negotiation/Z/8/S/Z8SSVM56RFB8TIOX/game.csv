"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that initial price is quite steep for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $500,000. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the inherent worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This reflects its true value while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on its value, but $1,400,000 is still  too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the product's worth.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the range, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. To move towards a deal, I'd be willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for moving closer.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $1,000,000? This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
