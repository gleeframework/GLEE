Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product's value is even higher. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000,  he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable or scarce.
* **Below John's Offer:**  Our offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer, giving Bob a potential ""deal"" while ensuring we make a profit if he accepts. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
