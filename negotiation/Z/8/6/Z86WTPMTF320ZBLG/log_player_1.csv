Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** I'm highlighting the potential gain for Bob, emphasizing that this is a good deal for him. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $900,000 is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation and potential compromise without losing too much of my own value. 

**Why not go higher?**  Because there's a risk Bob will immediately reject the offer and I might end up losing time and potentially even the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Value:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my personal value of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to move closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to secure a better deal.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  If I counter and Bob is serious about buying, he might be willing to go higher. 

**Why not sell to John?**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to potentially get closer to that amount through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $875,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** By offering $875,000, I'm showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price closer to my value.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance. 

**Why not go lower?**  Because I want to maximize my earnings, and $875,000 is still a reasonable amount considering Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $840000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:** Bob's offer of $840,000 is lower than my previous counteroffer of $875,000. It's getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he's already expressed interest in the product.
* **Minimizing Loss:** If I reject, I can still counter with a price closer to my desired amount, or ultimately sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Why not sell to John?** The potential for a better deal with Bob, even if slightly lower than John's offer, is still worth exploring."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $840,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession -  $860,000. It's a fair compromise that respects our both our needs.  Let's seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concessions:** I'm positioning this as my final compromise, adding pressure to Bob to accept.
* **Fair Compromise:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and equity.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm again using language like ""seal this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the transaction.

**Why not go lower?** I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe there's a chance Bob might accept this offer."
