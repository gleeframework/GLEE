"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $14,000. While the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has a goal of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $13,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $13,500.
* **Cost from John:** John is selling the product for $15,000.

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too great."
