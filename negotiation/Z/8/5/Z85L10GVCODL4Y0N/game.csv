"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the immense benefits it offers.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $900,000? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  I need to be upfront – the value of this product is substantial, and I'm not willing to go below $890,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price given the potential benefits you'll gain.",890000.0,Alice,5,
