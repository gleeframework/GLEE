Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
