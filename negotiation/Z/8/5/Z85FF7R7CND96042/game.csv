"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $9,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for in this product. Let's make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to cover the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500. How about we try $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. My final offer is $9,750. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other options.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm going to have to consider other options. Maybe we can revisit the conversation later if you're willing to come back to the table?",10000.0,Alice,7,
