"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product would be beneficial, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
