Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My goal:** Maximize my profit. 
* **Bob's value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **My minimum:**  I need at least $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Strategy:**  I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This gives Bob the feeling he might get a good deal, while still ensuring I get a good price. 

This strategy is a starting point.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's reactions and the potential risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** $1,200,000 is below my initial asking price, but still a decent profit.
* **My goal:** I want to maximize my profit, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob. 
* **Risk:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is guaranteed, I'm willing to risk losing John to potentially get closer to my desired price with Bob. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him I'm not desperate and am willing to negotiate further. This could lead to a better offer from him. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** $1,200,000 is lower than my initial offer, but I want to ensure I still make a good profit.
* **My goal:**  Maximize my profit, but also avoid losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Strategy:**  I'm reducing my price slightly, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This might incentivize Bob to compromise further. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us.  

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm open to further negotiation if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
