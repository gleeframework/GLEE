# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum limit.** There's no immediate benefit to accepting it.
* **You want to see if you can get a lower price.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate. 
* **John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a guaranteed purchase option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but still above your ideal price.**  You're not yet at your maximum willingness to pay. 
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and could lead to a lower price. 
* **John's offer is still a backup option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you're not locked into a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your target.** However, it's still slightly above your ideal price, and you're not at your maximum willingness to pay yet. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a price closer to $11,000.
* **John's offer remains a solid backup.**  If the negotiation stalls, you're not committed to purchasing from Alice."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is back at your maximum limit.** You've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed purchase at your maximum price.**  There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice.
* **Time is a factor.** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a deal that's worse for you. 

By buying from John, you're ensuring a quick and reliable purchase at your maximum acceptable price."
