"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find value in the product at this price, given it's worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have plenty of rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. Given that we are already in round 4, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and secure a sale."
