"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. I understand the product has value, but $1,300,000 is not feasible for me. I can go up to $850,000. This is a significant offer on my part.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000.  If you're able to come up to $1,100,000, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I need to move forward with the other offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
