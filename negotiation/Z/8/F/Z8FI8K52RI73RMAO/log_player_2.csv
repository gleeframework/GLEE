"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is higher than both her value and John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm hoping we can find a price point that works better for both of us. I'd be willing to offer $700,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Not Insulting:** However, $700,000 is still a respectable offer and is above Alice's perceived value of the product ($800,000). 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message keeps a friendly tone and indicates that I'm open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  Her ""meeting halfway"" claim is a tactic; the true middle ground is closer to $800,000. I believe I can get her closer to her value with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to consider $775,000?"", ""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a smaller amount ($75,000) than Alice's previous decrease. This shows I'm willing to move but still want a good deal.
* **Targeting Her Value:** $775,000 is just below Alice's value, putting some pressure on her while still being a profitable deal for her. 
* **Continuing the Conversation:** My message remains positive and collaborative, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close! Alice is now down to $825,000. While she's playing tough, I believe she's willing to go a little lower. We are getting into the later rounds, so I need to start being more aggressive with my counteroffers to secure a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $800,000.  If you're able to meet that, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being more direct now, stating my limit and creating a sense of urgency since we are past the halfway point.
* **Targeting Her Value:**  I'm sticking to her value ($800,000) as my offer. This is her break-even point, and she's motivated to make a deal.
* **Clear Choice:** I'm framing this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer to see if she's willing to accept her minimum. This also leaves open the possibility of her countering with a slightly higher price, giving me a chance to still get a good deal."
