"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm starting negotiations at $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise and is the highest I can afford.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I value the product highly, I want to find a solution that works for us both. Would you consider $1,250,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true potential of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute limit. This price allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
