"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to give up on the value this product can bring to your business. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you at $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
