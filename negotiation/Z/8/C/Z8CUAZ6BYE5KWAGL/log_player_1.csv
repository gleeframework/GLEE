Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to sell to Bob now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
