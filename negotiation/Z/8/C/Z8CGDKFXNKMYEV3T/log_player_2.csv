"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $130 is cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($80), it's still within your budget of $150 and saves you money compared to the other option."
