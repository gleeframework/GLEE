Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.  A price of $130 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John who'll pay $80, ensuring you won't be left with a loss. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit with Bob while acknowledging the secure alternative with John."
