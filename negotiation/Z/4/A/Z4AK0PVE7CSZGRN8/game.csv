"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $200. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $120?  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move on to other potential buyers.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us to both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, but $90 is still too low. Let's split the difference.  How about $105? This price is reasonable for both of us, and allows us to make a deal. ",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I can offer you $95, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget constraint, but $95 is just a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway again.  How about $100? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.  ",100.0,Alice,7,
