"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There's a significant gap between your perceived value ($1,500,000) and Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000), making room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer while still being a fair amount above her minimum value. This approach attempts to create a good starting point for further negotiation while still demonstrating your willingness to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price than $1,300,000, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate further. Continuing to negotiate could save you a significant amount of money compared to purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $1,050,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000. It demonstrates your willingness to move closer to her price but still maintains a significant discount from her initial offer. This approach allows you to continue negotiating while showing a commitment to reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to your maximum budget, and while further negotiation is possible, the risk of her increasing the price again or the negotiation dragging on becomes a factor.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John at $1,500,000, which is your maximum price."
