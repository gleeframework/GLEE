"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still above your target price of $100.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's offer.  It's likely Alice will reject this counteroffer, but it establishes a starting point and gives you room to negotiate upwards.  It's also close enough to your target price of $100 that you might be able to reach an agreement with Alice quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is just $5 above your target price of $100.  While you could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are small and the risk of further negotiation failing is high.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you the time and effort of continuing to negotiate."
