Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
