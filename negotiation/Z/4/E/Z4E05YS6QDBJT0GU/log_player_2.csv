Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is the minimum I can accept, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
