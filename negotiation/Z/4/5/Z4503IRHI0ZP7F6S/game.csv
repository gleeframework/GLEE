"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount, considering its true value to me is much higher. I believe this price is fair and represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can go a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? This still allows you a significant profit margin while giving me a fair return.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. How about $1,250,000? This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to go one step further to see if we can close this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,275,000. This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,220,000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
