``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Remember, it's always better to start high and negotiate down than to start low and regret missing out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $800,000 is your minimum price, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. Bob clearly sees the value of the product, so there's room for a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's potential value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to recoup a fair share of the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the ideal price, it's closer to your desired price point than John's offer of $800,000.  It's important to consider the risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a better price from Bob, and you could potentially lose the sale altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you secure a profit, and avoids the risk of potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
