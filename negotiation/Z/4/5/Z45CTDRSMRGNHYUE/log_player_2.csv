Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800000 is my minimum, I believe the product's potential value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to recoup a fair share of the product's worth.
