Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,500,  $9,500 is a good deal, especially considering Bob's willingness to go up to that amount. I'll accept his offer."
