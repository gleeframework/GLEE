Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Fairness:**  I'm acknowledging the value of the product to Bob, making the offer seem less arbitrary and more likely to be considered.
* **Openness to negotiation:** My message indicates a willingness to discuss the price further, which encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. I'll also consider if John's offer of $1,200,000 is more attractive at that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested in the product. This gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more acceptable price.
* **John's offer:**  Although John's offer of $1,200,000 is very attractive, I'm willing to try and negotiate with Bob further, hoping to reach a price closer to John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer of $950,000 and my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If negotiations with Bob fail to produce a satisfactory result, I'll accept John's offer and sell to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Fairness:**  I'm still aiming for a price that's reasonably close to my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profit for me.
* **Clear communication:** I'm clearly stating my position and proposing a specific price, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, we have a deal. 
* **Further negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my next move,  potentially making a final counteroffer or accepting John's offer if negotiations seem to be stalling."
