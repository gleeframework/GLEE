The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $14,000.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  If that doesn't work, you can always go with John's offer."

Alice is still asking for more than what the product is worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

I'm offering $11,500. This is closer to what the product is worth to me, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it."
