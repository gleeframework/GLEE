"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price. Would you be interested in taking a look at it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $100. You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
