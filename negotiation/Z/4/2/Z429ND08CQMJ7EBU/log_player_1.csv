"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit but leaving room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I believe he'll be willing to pay a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  I believe a price of $10,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer of $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is close to my minimum price of $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $8,000. I'll take the deal and move on."
