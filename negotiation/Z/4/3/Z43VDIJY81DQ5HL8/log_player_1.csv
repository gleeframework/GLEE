Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your inventory."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80. 
* **John's Offer:** John offers a safety net of $80.

By offering the product at $100, you are:

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  You aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum and closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $100 is your initial offer, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants it badly enough. 
* **Staying Above Your Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects your offer, you can still sell to John for $80."
