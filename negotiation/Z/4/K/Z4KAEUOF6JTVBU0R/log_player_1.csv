Round 4

This is a tough call because I'm running out of rounds, but Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my starting price and I'm not sure I can get more. If I reject this, I have only two rounds left with Bob, and it's not clear I can get him to budge. It's probably better to take the offer at this point."
