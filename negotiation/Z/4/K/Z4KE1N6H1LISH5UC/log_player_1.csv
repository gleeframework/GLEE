Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value is even higher, potentially justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I get a price significantly higher than Bob values the product for.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This gives me the opportunity to understand his budget better and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem. I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
