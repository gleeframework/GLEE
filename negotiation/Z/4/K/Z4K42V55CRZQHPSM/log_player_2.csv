Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1175000. I can meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1212500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
