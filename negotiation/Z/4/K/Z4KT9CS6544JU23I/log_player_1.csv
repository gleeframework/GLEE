Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'll offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,100,000 offer. We've reached a point where the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him walking away. Accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids a potential loss if Bob refuses to budge."
