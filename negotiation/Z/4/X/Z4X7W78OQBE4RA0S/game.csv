"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price.  How about $11,000? It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $11,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
