Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $120, which is $112.50. Would you be willing to go that high?

While I could try to haggle Alice down a bit further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $112.50 gets me the product at a price significantly lower than John's $150."
