{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures you're getting a good deal and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:**  This gives Bob a good reason to negotiate, but also ensures he's getting a good deal. 

By starting with a reasonable offer, you encourage Bob to negotiate, giving you both the chance to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is a good one, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is higher than your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered, and far less than the product's value to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a valuable asset.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $950,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is still less than what you'd ideally want, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is closer to your desired price point."
