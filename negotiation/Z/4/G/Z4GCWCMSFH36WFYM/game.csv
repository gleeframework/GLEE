"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is still a little steep for me - how about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $760,000 is pushing it. How about we settle at $800,000 even? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",800000.0,Alice,5,
