"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value it brings. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Since you can buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no reason to pay Alice $15,000. You should reject her offer and see if she'll come down in price."
