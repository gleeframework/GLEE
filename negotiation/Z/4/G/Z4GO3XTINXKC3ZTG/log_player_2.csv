"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's start with an offer of $140. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high, there's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By countering with a significantly lower price ($110), we aim to establish a bargaining position that allows room for negotiation upwards.
* **Polite and Engaged:**  The message maintains a friendly and interested tone, fostering a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Hinting at budget limitations provides a subtle reason for the lower counter-offer without revealing our absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to our desired price range, there's still room for negotiation.  We'll reject this offer and try to push the price down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $115.  Would that price point be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're nudging our offer up slightly from $110 to $115, showing Alice we're willing to compromise. 
* **Target Zone:**  $115 represents a good balance â€“ it's a significant savings from the initial offer while likely still being profitable for Alice.
* **Clear Communication:** We're directly stating our desired price range, hoping to encourage Alice to meet us there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how does $120 sound to you? It's a bit higher than your last suggestion, but still below the original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $120 is a solid price for the product. We've managed to save $30 from the original asking price and $35 from John's alternative.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much further reduction. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but we're likely reaching her lower limit. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further delays us from getting the product. Accepting now secures a good deal without unnecessary delay."
