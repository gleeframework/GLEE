"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your proposed price. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and offers a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.
