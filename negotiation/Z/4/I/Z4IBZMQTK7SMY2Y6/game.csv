"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. My initial price is $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $850,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your proposed price. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and offers a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be totally transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000. I'd rather work with you, but I need the price to make sense for me. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I'm still hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.  $925,000 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair value for the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
