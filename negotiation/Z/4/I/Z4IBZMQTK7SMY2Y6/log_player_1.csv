Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $850,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
