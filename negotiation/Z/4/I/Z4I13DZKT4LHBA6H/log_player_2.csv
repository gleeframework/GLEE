"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much negotiating room there is. This leaves me space to increase my offer if needed, while still staying well below my $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but it's still above my budget and John's price. I need to counter-offer again to try and get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $7,200?"",
""product_price"": 7200
}
``` 

This counteroffer brings the price closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still leaving room for further discussion if needed."
