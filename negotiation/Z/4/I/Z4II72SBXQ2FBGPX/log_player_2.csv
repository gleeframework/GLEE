"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a significant discount considering its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* This means you can save $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, your goal is to save money, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
