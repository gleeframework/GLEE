"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I appreciate your consideration.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This offer reflects its worth while still providing you a reasonable price.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with both our expectations.",9500.0,Bob,4,
