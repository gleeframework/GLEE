"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the starting point, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, considering its value and the potential benefits it brings.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and I hope you'll find it agreeable.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price takes into account your concerns while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
