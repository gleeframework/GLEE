Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** It leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a win-win outcome.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It shows that you're willing to negotiate but also value your product.

Let me know how the negotiation progresses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than the price I want to achieve. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
