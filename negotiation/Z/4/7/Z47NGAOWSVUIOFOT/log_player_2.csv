"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $15,000, which is a better deal than $16,500. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
