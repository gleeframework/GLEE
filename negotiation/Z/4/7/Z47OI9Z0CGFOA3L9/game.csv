"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",10750.0,Bob,4,
