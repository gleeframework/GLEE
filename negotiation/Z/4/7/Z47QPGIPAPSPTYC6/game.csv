"Alice, your product seems great, but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration of your offer, we've decided to make a counteroffer. We believe that the true value of this product aligns more closely with its original asking price. Therefore, we propose a revised price of $900,000. This still represents a significant discount for you, while ensuring that we receive a fair compensation for our efforts and investment in the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in your product and my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"After further review and consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to compromise. Therefore, we propose a revised price of $875,000 for our product. This remains a premium price, reflecting the quality and value it offers, but it is also within your proposed range. We hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.",875000.0,Alice,5,
