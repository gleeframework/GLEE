# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration of your offer, we've decided to make a counteroffer. We believe that the true value of this product aligns more closely with its original asking price. Therefore, we propose a revised price of $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After further review and consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to compromise. Therefore, we propose a revised price of $875,000 for our product. This remains a premium price, reflecting the quality and value it offers, but it is also within your proposed range. We hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.

There's no guarantee you can get a lower price from Alice, and continuing the negotiation might just waste time."
