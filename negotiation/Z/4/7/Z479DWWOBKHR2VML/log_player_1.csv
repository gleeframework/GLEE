Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is $200,000 below Bob's value, giving him a good deal.  It's also $200,000 above my minimum, ensuring I maximize my profit.  This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and selling to John for less) with the potential for a higher sale price."
