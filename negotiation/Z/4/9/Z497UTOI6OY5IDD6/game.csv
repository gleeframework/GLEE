"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $5000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $8500? That leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $7500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this excellent product.",7500.0,Alice,5,
