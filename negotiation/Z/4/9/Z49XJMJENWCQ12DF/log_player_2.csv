Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's worth it considering the value the product brings you. What do you say?

However, I notice that Jhon is offering the product for $12,000, which is the same price Alice is offering now. I'll keep that in mind for future decisions.
