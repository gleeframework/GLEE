"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to buy it for $150. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $165. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $155, which is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend. Let's try to come to an agreement on that.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you at $162. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",162.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $162. How about we split the difference and settle on $158?  I'm eager to buy the product but can't go any higher than that.",158.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge from $162. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. If you buy the product from me at $162, I'll also include a premium service that's usually valued at $20. This way, you'll get the product and a valuable bonus. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",162.0,Alice,7,
