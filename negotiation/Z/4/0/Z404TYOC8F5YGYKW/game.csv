"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,800,000. This reflects the product's potential and allows me to make this a win-win.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
