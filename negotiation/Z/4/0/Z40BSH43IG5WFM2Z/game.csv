I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for it. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $16000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,5,
