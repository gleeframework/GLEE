Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to avoid selling to John, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price and higher than what John is offering. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
