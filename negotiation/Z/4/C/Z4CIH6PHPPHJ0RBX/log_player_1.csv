"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable value. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a more favorable deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and gives you insight into his perception of the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,600,000, there's space to come down in price while still remaining above your $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your target range and leaves a considerable sum on the table. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your initial proposal. You still have ample room for negotiation and the backup option of John ensures you won't be forced into an unfavorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit further from what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,550,000? This recognizes the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down by $50,000 from your initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point between your initial ask and Bob's offer, encouraging a collaborative approach to the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** The language emphasizes the product's inherent worth, subtly guiding Bob towards a higher valuation. 
* **Time Consideration:** With several rounds remaining, you can afford to make calculated concessions while still striving for a price closer to your ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a strong price that significantly exceeds your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is likely to be incremental compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate revenue, which can be reinvested or utilized for other purposes. 

Accepting this offer represents a balanced outcome where you secure a substantial profit while minimizing risk and potential delays."
