I'm starting with a price of $17,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $15,000 to him. I'm also prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see if I can get a higher price first."

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $16,500. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."

Bob's offer is a good price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's a little bit lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
