{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by establishing a friendly tone and highlighting Bob's potential interest in the product. The price is set at $140, which is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $140.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $120 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems we're at an impasse.  Rather than continuing to go back and forth, I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
