# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and features, it's valued at $150 by many of our customers. Considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and your interest. Would you be open to exploring a price that could make this transaction beneficial for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $125, which is still above your desired price point. Since you have another option to buy the product from John for $150, you should reject Alice's offer.  You can then buy the product from John, staying within your budget."
