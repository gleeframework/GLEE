"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price of $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit while still fitting within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, but $950,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth this price to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer it to you for $925,000, but I need to make it a bit sweeter for you. I'll throw in some additional services and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. So, I'm willing to meet your price of $925,000, but I expect you to appreciate the added value. Let me know if this is a deal you're ready to accept.",925000.0,Alice,7,
