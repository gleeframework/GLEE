,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make the sale happen.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $155 for the product. Can you consider that?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. How about we meet in the middle at $162.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",162.5,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're really close, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $157.50. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",160.0,Alice,7,

"I've gone as low as I can, Alice. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and buy it from John for $120.",150.0,Bob,10,
