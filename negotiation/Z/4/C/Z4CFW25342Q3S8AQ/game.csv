,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm expecting from the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",15500.0,Alice,5,
