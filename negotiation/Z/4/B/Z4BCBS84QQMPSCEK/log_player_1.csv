"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so we begin significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and expresses optimism about reaching a deal. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my target. We have ample rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my safety net but not ideal at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession ($150,000) from our initial price to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're still holding firm above the $2 million mark, reinforcing the product's high value and our desire for a premium price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and our desired price, signaling our willingness to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a strong interest in the product.  While $1,900,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. With 6 rounds remaining, there's room to push for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To show you I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price exactly between Bob's last offer ($1,900,000) and my previous counteroffer ($2,100,000). This signals a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Highlighting Concessions:** I'm emphasizing that this price represents a significant move on my part, encouraging Bob to recognize the value of the offer.
* **Final Push:** While I'm willing to negotiate further, this offer puts the pressure on Bob to make a substantial move if he wants the product.  It sets the stage for potentially accepting his counteroffer in the next round if he's willing to meet me closer to $2,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal.  Bob is clearly interested but seems unwilling to budge significantly above $1,850,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $350,000 over my minimum and avoids the risk of a stalemate. While I could push for a bit more, the difference isn't substantial enough to risk losing the sale entirely at this point."
