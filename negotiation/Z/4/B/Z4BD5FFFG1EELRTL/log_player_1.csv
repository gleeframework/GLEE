``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than the middle ground, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a significant profit. I'm also highlighting the value the product holds for him, hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm really at my limit. I'm willing to go up to $11,250 one more time. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15,000.
