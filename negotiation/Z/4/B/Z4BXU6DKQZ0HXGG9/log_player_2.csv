"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your goal, it's still above your target of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price. There's a chance she might be willing to come down a bit, especially since you have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is $50,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, it's still $75,000 higher. There's still potential for negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal, and I don't want to miss out on potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to continue to push for a lower price, but this time I'm getting closer to my target of $800,000. This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to negotiate without dropping below her desired price.  It's a strategic move to see if she'll bite.  If she rejects, I'll have to decide if it's worth pursuing further or just buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $50,000 higher than my target price. While it's a good deal, it's no longer worth the risk of further negotiation. I've already gone through multiple rounds, and it seems like Alice is firm on her price. It's time to secure the product at my desired price from John."
