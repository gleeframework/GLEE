"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for $8000.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,
