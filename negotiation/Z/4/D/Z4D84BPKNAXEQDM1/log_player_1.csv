Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $135 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $135 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), so he has an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob balks at the price, you can lower it slightly without dropping below your minimum. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob happy enough to buy."
