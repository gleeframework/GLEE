"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer. $11,000 is still a bit much for me. How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can offer you a slight concession at $11,250, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. It seems like we're getting closer. How about $10,750?  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to push for a lower price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $10,800.  Take it or leave it.",10800.0,Bob,8,
