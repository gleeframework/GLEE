``` 

This offer is significantly above my minimum of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is looking for a better deal.  It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for him ($1,500,000).  There's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product to you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still a significant distance from my target. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and go down to $1,050,000.  This is my last offer.  Let's see if we can agree on this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my target.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.  At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
