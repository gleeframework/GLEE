"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than it's worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",990000.0,Bob,4,
