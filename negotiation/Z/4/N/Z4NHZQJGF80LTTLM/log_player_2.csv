"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than it's worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because it's too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to meet Alice halfway.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is trying to get as close to her desired price as possible. I'll reject her offer again and make another counteroffer. Since she's already offered $950,000, I'll try to get a bit closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'll offer $980,000.
