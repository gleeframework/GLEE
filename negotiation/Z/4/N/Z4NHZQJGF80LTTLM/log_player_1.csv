Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than it's worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,000,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've given Bob some wiggle room to negotiate if he feels the price is too high. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm not going to settle just yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

$990,000 is a good price. It's close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by pushing for a higher price."
