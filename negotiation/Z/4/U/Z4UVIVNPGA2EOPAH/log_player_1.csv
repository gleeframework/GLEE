{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's lower than the product's worth to Bob, but higher than your minimum. It also allows for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to respond and potentially making him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is more than what John is offering, it's significantly lower than my minimum price and less than what I originally proposed. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is slightly above my minimum price and a decent deal, considering I'm willing to take the risk of rejection in the next round.  It's also higher than what John is offering.  It's time to secure the deal."
