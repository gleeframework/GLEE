"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully land a price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer. This should keep Bob engaged and potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept it. If he doesn't, I'll sell it to John for the same price."
