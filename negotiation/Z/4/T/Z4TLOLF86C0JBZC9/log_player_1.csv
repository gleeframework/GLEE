Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. Although $8,500 is better than $8,000, I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $9,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's a risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds. John's offer of $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's guaranteed. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing out on any profit."
