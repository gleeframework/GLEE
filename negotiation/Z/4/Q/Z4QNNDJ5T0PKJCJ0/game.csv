"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I know it's a valuable asset for your company, and I'm confident it will be a strong investment.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but  $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $1000000.  This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
