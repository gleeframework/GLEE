Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an offer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $950,000 might be a bit high for my current budget. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000. I hope this is within your considerations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $900,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm satisfied with this outcome."
