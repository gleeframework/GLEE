"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $11,500 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000 if that works for you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
