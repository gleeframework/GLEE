"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me ($10,000).  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, or at least get closer to my minimum acceptable price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle just yet. It's only round 4, and I have plenty of time to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price, especially since Bob has shown he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, my absolute minimum for this product.  It's a fair price, and you'll be getting a great deal!  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
