{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get closer to the maximum value. It's important to be confident and provide a reason for the price, even if it's a bit high. This sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a sale,  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer but $120 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's a good price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and potentially losing the sale.  By offering a lower price, I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate, but $140 is still above my minimum, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $140. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make one final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll need to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm aiming for a final counteroffer that's closer to my minimum. I'm also adding a bit of pressure by mentioning the possibility of selling to another buyer. This might encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $135 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still too low. I've already made several concessions and feel I've given him a fair opportunity to negotiate.  Rather than continue this negotiation, I'm going to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
