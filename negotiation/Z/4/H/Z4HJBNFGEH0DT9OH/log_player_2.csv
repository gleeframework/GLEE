It's a great deal at $500,000, but I can likely get it for even less by negotiating with Alice."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $300,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me."

Alice is coming down in price, which is good.  I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still want a good deal."

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still going to try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm not ready to accept $450,000 yet."

I'm going to raise my offer to $400,000. This is a significant jump, showing Alice that I'm willing to pay a bit more. However, I believe we can still reach an agreement at a price that works for both of us."

Alice is now very close to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that I'll get a lower price.  It's better to accept her offer and secure the product at a good price."
