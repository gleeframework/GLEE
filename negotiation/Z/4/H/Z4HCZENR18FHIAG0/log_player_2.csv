You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  Offering $1,200,000 is a bold move, but it's within his budget and could potentially entice Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will get stubborn or the deal will fall through. Buying from Alice at this price is a good compromise, saving him $200,000 compared to buying from John."
