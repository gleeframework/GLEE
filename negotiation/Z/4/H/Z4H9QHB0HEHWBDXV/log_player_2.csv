"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer below $7,500 to see if I can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll counteroffer a bit lower than her offer to try and meet somewhere in the middle."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is only willing to come down slightly now. While I could try to negotiate further, the difference is getting smaller. Accepting at $6,800 is a good deal compared to John's $8,000 price."
