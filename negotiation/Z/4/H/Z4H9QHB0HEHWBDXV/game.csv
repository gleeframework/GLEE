"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $6,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",6800.0,Alice,5,
