{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategically priced:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** It gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It shows you are willing to compromise while still securing a profit.
* **Leaves space for counteroffers:**  It allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately forcing you to John's offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the value I see in the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I need to push for a higher price.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,075,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and am now offering $1,060,000 for your product. I believe this price strikes a balance between respecting the value of the product and staying within my budget. I hope you find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal from him. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and allows me to avoid potentially going back and forth with Bob further.  I'm willing to take this offer to secure the deal and move on."
