"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000 for this product.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money.
* **Focuses on shared benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties, making it less confrontational. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $11,000 is still a decent profit for Alice and provides space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. 
* **Building momentum:**  Rejecting this offer demonstrates Bob's commitment to getting the best price.
* **No immediate urgency:**  Bob has 10 rounds to make a deal, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference and go with $11,500.  This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway.
* **Appeals to fairness:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" makes it more appealing to Alice.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation (if needed):** While $11,500 is a good price for Bob, it still leaves room for a slight adjustment if Alice is adamant about a higher price."
