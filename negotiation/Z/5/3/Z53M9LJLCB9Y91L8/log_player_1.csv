Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Even though Bob's offer is quite close to his perceived value, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
