"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $12,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $12,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay. While he could buy from Alice, he can get the same product from John for $12,000, which is within his budget."
