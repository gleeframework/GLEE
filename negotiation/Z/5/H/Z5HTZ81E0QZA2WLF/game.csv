"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $1200000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  This would still give you a significant value, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get closer to my original target of $1200000. How about we try $1250000? That's still a significant discount from your original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
