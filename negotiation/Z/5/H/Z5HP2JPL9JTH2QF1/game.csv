"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I could consider a price of $975,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response.  I understand the value, but $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
