# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I believe would be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,000,000. There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
