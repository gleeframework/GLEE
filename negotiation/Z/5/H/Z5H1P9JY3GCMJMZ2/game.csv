"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $900000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,6,
