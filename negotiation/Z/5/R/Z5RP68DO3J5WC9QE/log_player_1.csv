Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000, but I can do $10,750 if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $10,750 is better than $10,000, I'm still not comfortable with that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm willing to go down to $11,250. That's a good compromise and a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, so let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still losing a significant amount of money. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product, and that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been going back and forth with Bob for a few rounds, and while I'm getting closer to my desired price, we're still quite far apart.  It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I'm starting to feel like I might not get the price I want from Bob. To be safe, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees me a good profit, and it avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and ending up with a much lower price."
