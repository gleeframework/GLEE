"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is outside your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000.

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000. However, I'm not willing to go that low.
