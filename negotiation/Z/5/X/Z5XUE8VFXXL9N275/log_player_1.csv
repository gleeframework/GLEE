Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price, but it's still a good start to the negotiation.  I'm not going to sell to John yet as I still think I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and send him a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $11,000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap and get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum. I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  Selling to John would be less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
