"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Alice,3,
