"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
