"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely do better. Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is still a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get closer to his desired price by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering again. He can aim for a price somewhere between $700,000 and $900,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $850,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $880000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to her desired price. At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer at $880,000 still saves Bob a substantial amount compared to buying from John and allows him to secure the product."
