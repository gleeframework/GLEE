"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $850000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $880000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",880000.0,Alice,5,
