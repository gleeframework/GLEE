I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. $8,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Negotiating with Bob has taken several rounds and I'm not confident I can get much closer to my desired price. It's better to secure the $10,000 from John and move on."
