"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's more than fair. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.  Let's discuss a price of $1,400,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000).  

Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can negotiate with Alice further or potentially find a better deal elsewhere. Buying from John immediately would be the least cost-effective choice."
