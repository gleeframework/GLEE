Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above the guaranteed amount.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer is framed as ""exclusive"" and time-sensitive to encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** The price of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. However, the message emphasizes the ""investment"" potential, aiming to shift Bob's focus towards potential future gains rather than just the immediate value.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since we have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,500,000, the potential for a higher profit from Bob outweighs the risk in this scenario."
