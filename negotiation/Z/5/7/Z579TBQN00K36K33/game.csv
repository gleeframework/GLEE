"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident the product's benefits will far outweigh the cost for you. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000? This way, we both get a good deal. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
