"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will exceed your expectations. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above the product's value to Bob ($800,000) but still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message focuses on the value the product offers, encouraging Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a call to discuss, inviting Bob to engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm not giving up on getting a better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident the product's benefits will far outweigh the cost for you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, a significant reduction that demonstrates my willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000), ensuring I don't lose out on my desired profit.
* **Emphasizing Value Again:**  The message reiterates the product's value and benefits, hoping to sway Bob's decision.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message suggests this is a final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Below My Minimum:**  $950,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  I haven't lost any money yet, so I still have the option to sell to John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This way, we both get a good deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting at My Minimum:** This offer is my absolute minimum. 
* **Finality and Compromise:**  The message emphasizes this is a final offer, suggesting I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I frame the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that both of us would get a fair deal. 
* **Decision Time:**  This offer puts the ball in Bob's court, forcing him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $920,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get Bob to budge much further. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will offer a lower price in the next round, further decreasing my potential earnings.
* **Guaranteeing Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, which is my minimum target.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a higher risk of getting a lower price."
