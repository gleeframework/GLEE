"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. ",120.0,Alice,5,
