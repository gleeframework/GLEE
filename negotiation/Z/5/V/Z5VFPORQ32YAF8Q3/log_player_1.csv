Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting reasons why Bob might reconsider his own valuation.
* **Alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable, I can always walk away and still secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is my safety net, but I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product offers is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, which shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm still holding firm above Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. The goal is to gradually move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value, attempting to nudge Bob's perception closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant amount considering my budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has only increased by $50,000.  While he's moving in the right direction, the pace of negotiation suggests it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $1,200,000.  It's now more profitable for me to cut off negotiations with Bob and take John's guaranteed offer."
