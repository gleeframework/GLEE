"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let's start the conversation with a price of $900,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $750,000 is simply too low.  To reflect the true value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good price, and allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Bob,4,
