"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial offer, aiming to get a better deal. This counteroffer is still higher than the product's value to Alice, leaving room for further negotiation. Bob also tries to appeal to Alice by framing the counteroffer as a fair price, hoping to encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than $950,000, there is still room for negotiation to get closer to his desired price range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his desired range.  This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. He also reiterates the fairness of the price to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 is still just below my target price.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range than previous offers.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to buy from John at $1,000,000 is high.
* **Time constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures a deal is reached without risking running out of time. 

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $110,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving."
