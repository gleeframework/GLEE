,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's close this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 is still just below my target price.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay.",890000.0,Alice,5,
