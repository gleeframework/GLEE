"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and it's a fair offer that balances both our needs.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price that considers both our needs.  I'm open to further discussion if you'd like, but I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to offer $9,750. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a good midpoint that reflects the value of your product while staying within my budget. I'm confident that this is a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say?",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $10,250. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of my product while also being within your budget. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal!",10250.0,Alice,7,
