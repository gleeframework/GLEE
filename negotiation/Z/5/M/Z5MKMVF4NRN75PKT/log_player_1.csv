Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price but still significantly more than Bob's perceived value. This makes it more tempting for him to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time offer"" adds a bit of pressure and might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision."
