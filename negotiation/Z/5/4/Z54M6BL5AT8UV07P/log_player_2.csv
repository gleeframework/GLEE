"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $900,000, while John wants $1,200,000.
* **Bob saves money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible,  $900,000 is still within his budget and a significant saving compared to the alternative."
