"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a great value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $11,500 is still too high for me.  Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives me a chance to make a good return on my investment.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $10,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation and potential lost time/opportunity."
