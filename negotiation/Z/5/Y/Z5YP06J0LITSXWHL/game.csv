"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a great value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $11,500 is still too high for me.  Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives me a chance to make a good return on my investment.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
