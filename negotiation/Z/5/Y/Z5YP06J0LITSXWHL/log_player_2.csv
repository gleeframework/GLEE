"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a great value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still outside of Bob's budget.  While closer, it's important to continue negotiating to get the price down further.  Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,500 is still too high for me.  Let's try $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives me a chance to make a good return on my investment.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
