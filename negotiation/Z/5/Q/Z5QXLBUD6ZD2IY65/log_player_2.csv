"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is over his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, and he believes that $8,000 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it is still within the range where Bob is willing to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not a great deal.  It's worth trying to get the price down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his initial counteroffer, but he is still trying to stay below John's price. This offer is a compromise and could be attractive to Alice, especially if she is eager to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still not a great deal. Bob has already gone through multiple rounds of negotiations and knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's time to stop haggling and secure the product at the best possible price."
