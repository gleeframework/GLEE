Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on his counteroffer.

Remember, the key is to find a price that's attractive to both you and Bob while leaving room for negotiation."
