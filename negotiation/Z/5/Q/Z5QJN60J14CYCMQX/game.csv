"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
