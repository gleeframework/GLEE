"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $10000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. This product is truly special, and I'm confident it's worth more than $8000. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further negotiation.  What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we settle at $8750? This way, we can both be happy with the deal and move forward.",8750.0,Alice,5,
