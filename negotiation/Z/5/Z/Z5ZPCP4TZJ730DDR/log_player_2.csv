"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's a good idea to see if you can negotiate a better price. Since you have 10 rounds, you have time to explore if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price. If she's not, you can adjust your offer accordingly in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. This product is truly special, and I'm confident it's worth more than $8000. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility by meeting you halfway, but you're still aiming to save more money.  By rejecting this offer, you can continue to try and negotiate a lower price. You have several rounds left, and there's still a good chance you can get closer to your target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further negotiation.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise but still trying to stay below Alice's price. This strategy puts pressure on Alice to accept, especially as you have limited rounds remaining.  If she rejects, you can further increase your offer slightly in the next round, while still remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we settle at $8750? This way, we can both be happy with the deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and the current offer is very close to your target of $8,000. You have several rounds remaining, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to get a lower price. Accepting this offer allows you to close the deal and save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
