Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I propose a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob and framing it as an exclusive opportunity, I create a sense of urgency and desirability."
