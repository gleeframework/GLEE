Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and well within my budget.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
