"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and well within my budget.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11000? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's still above your valuation, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,5,
