Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $1,112,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a lower price, Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is getting closer to my ideal price.  There's always a risk of going back and forth for too long and losing the deal altogether.  It's a good price considering the value of the product to me, and I don't want to risk losing it."
