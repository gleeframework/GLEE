"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $950,000. Let's see if we can shake on it!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $825,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I need to make a profit, after all. Let's see if we can close the deal at $900,000!",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize this transaction.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $850,000, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $920,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $885,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to close this transaction.",885000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. Let's finalize the deal at $900,000!",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Bob,10,
