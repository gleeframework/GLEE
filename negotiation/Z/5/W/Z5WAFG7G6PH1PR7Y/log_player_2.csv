"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
