"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept since it's still below the product's value to Alice, it's important to try and negotiate a lower price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too much.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,310,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1310000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but she's still unwilling to budge.  At this point, I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the product for $1,200,000 from John than risk going over my budget and potentially not securing the product at all.  I'm going to buy from John and move on."
