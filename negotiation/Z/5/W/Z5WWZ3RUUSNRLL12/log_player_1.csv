"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. My starting price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to $11,500. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,200? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10900 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my desired price point. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I believe I can still get closer to my target.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiations, hoping to find a compromise closer to $11,200.  If the next few rounds don't yield a satisfactory result, I'll consider selling to John to secure my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows you to get the product you need."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob keeps offering $10,800, and I've lowered my price to $11,000. With only four rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to reach a higher price with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $12,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm prioritizing securing my minimum profit and moving on."
