Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start with my minimum price. This ensures I get at least my value for the product. If Bob rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to sell the product, $10,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $11,000. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer but still gives me a profit."
