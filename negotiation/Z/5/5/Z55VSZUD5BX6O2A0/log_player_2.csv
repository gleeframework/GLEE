"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's currently valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I believe it represents a strong value proposition for both of us.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is trying to convince you that her product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but you know John will sell it for $1,000,000. There's no reason to pay more than John's price."
