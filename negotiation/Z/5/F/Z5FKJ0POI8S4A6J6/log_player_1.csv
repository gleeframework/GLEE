This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in purchasing the product at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find this investment to be very worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll counter with another offer, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."
