"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find this investment to be very worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with this investment. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
