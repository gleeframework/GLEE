"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $80.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation. I want to try to get as close to my target price as possible while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $82.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.  This is still above Bob's last offer, but closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  Bob is not willing to budge much, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a higher price. I can guarantee $80 by selling to John, which is my minimum value. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most sensible choice at this point."
