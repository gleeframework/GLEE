"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750000, which is still a good profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $800000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
