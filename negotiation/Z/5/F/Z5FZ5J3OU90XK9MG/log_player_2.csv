Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's worth negotiating further.  You can try a counteroffer to lower the price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000, which is still a good profit for you and a great deal for me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is within your budget and closer to your target price.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. It's a good deal to accept at this point."
