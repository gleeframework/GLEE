"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product to your specific business operations goes beyond that. It offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I can come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the unique advantages of the product, Alice, but I still need to be mindful of our budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
