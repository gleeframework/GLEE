"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price of $18,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more realistic price, but $6,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but $8,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
