Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, making the offer more enticing. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, allowing Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.

This approach balances maximizing my profit with maintaining a chance for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $900,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I can still potentially get a higher price by counteroffering.
* **Avoiding a quick deal:**  Selling to Bob now would secure a good price, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my initial offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to improve the deal or, if necessary, fall back to selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us both to get a good value from this transaction. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer outright, but I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway. 
* **Highlighting fairness:**  The message emphasizes that my counteroffer is a ""fair compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $925,000 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer, giving me a stronger negotiating position.

By counteroffering, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** While $920,000 is not my ideal price, it's only $5,000 less than my counteroffer.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting again could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out completely.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John would be a significant drop in price.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonably good price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
