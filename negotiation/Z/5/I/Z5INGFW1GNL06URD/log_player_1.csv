"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building rapport:** I'm trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By offering $13,000, I give Bob some space to counter without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and allowing for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.  
* **Strategic leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a better price and can potentially leverage his interest to get closer to my target. 

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to continue working with you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, highlighting a ""good deal"" for both parties.
* **Maintaining momentum:** I'm still aiming for a price higher than John's offer, but I'm making progress towards a potential agreement with Bob. 

By offering a compromise and maintaining a positive tone, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Remaining rounds:** I have 6 rounds left, and there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees a sale, I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's significantly below what I believe the product is worth.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. $11,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving the needle:**  I'm moving the price closer to my target but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about a deal but not willing to settle for a low price. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage continued dialogue.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.

By offering a slightly higher price and continuing to emphasize the value of the product, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer or come back with a counteroffer that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is now within my acceptable range and significantly better than John's offer. 
* **Limited time:**  We're in round 6, and time is running out. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows for future opportunities to potentially negotiate a higher price on other products or services.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is more profitable than selling to John, and it keeps the door open for potential future business with Bob."
