"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to continue working with you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. $11,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,
