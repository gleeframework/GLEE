"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. As we've discussed, this product is worth $8,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be a more reasonable price point. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
