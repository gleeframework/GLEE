"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for potential negotiation while still valuing my product at more than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this will give me room to negotiate downwards while still maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could accept and walk away with something, it's not worth it given my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. It's also still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair counteroffer that gives Bob a better deal while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer is still too low.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't fairly reflect the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that this is a fair offer considering the value of the product. If Bob rejects this, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is taking too long and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get at least my minimum price, I will sell to John."
