Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring you get a good price.
* **It's a strong opening:**  Starting high shows confidence and allows for a more favorable outcome.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible, but also to be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet you somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum of $15,000 and it's significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer addresses a few points:

* **It's a compromise:** It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but also lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still profitable:** $9,000 is still above Bob's perceived value and closer to my desired price.
* **It's respectful:**  The message acknowledges Bob's offer while reiterating my position. 

This counteroffer positions me to potentially reach a deal with Bob while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm not ready to sell for that low of a price. I'll make another counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a firm stance:** It's a clear signal that I'm close to my limit.
* **Shows a willingness to compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not giving up my desired profit.
* **Sets a deadline:** It implies that if Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on. 

This tactic aims to push Bob to make a final decision and hopefully secure a sale closer to my desired price."
