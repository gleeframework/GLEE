Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, knowing he might counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than my minimum price. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $75?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $72? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $72 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John, so I'll sell to him instead."
