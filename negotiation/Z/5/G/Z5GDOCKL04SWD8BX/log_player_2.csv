Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was thinking we could meet at $1,120,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to get us to a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,120,000 is close enough to my last counteroffer of $1,100,000.  I've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John, and further negotiation may just drag things out.  It's time to accept and move forward."
