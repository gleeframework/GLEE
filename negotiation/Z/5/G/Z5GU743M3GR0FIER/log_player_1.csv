"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and would be a wise investment.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I don't want to start too high and scare Bob away, but I also want to ensure I have space to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value and positions it as a worthwhile investment, aiming to influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business.  To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding, but Stand Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate that my product holds value beyond his proposal. 
* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** I make a substantial price reduction from my initial offer ($100,000) to show flexibility but remain well above my $1,200,000 minimum (and John's offer).
* **Focus on Value:** I re-emphasize the product's potential benefits for Bob's business, aiming to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. 
* **Limited Upside Potential:** While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, it's unlikely Bob will go significantly higher. There's a risk of him walking away or my asking price becoming unreasonable.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and secures the $1,200,000, which I can then reinvest or utilize elsewhere."
