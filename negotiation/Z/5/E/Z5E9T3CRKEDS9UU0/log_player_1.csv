"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and probes Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" without being too specific. This provides a basis for the high price without revealing my hand completely.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting high, I aim to anchor the negotiation around a higher number. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer is likely to be more favorable than if I had started lower.
 
This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the need to find a price agreeable to Bob within the 10-round limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. That initial price is quite high.  I'm more comfortable in the ballpark of $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Space:**  While his offer is low, it indicates he's interested. There's room to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The guaranteed $1,500,000 from John provides a strong fallback position. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value while recognizing your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, the new price remains comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Anchoring:** While moving closer to Bob's range, I'm staying firmly above his initial offer to avoid anchoring the negotiation too low. 
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value but acknowledged Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still significantly above my budget. To be realistic, I can offer up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased, $700,000 remains significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting would still result in a substantial loss.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffers are increasing at a very slow pace, suggesting it's unlikely he'll reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Strong Alternative:** The guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is becoming increasingly appealing as negotiations with Bob stall. 
 
I'll need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $1,700,000 as my final offer. This is a substantial concession on my part, and I need you to meet me closer to that figure if we're to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to signal the seriousness of the situation to Bob. This adds pressure for him to make a significant move.
* **Smaller Concession:** The price reduction is smaller this time, emphasizing that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Call to Action:** I'm directly challenging Bob to meet me closer to my price, shifting the onus of movement to him. 

If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I'll walk away and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me, I am willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer.  I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Final Offer:**  Even with his final offer, Bob is only willing to pay $800,000. This remains far below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob's offer barely increased. It's clear he won't reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Secure Alternative:** John's standing offer guarantees $1,500,000.  Continuing with Bob carries significant risk with little potential reward. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. Selling to John ensures a significant profit and avoids wasting further time on a negotiation unlikely to succeed."
