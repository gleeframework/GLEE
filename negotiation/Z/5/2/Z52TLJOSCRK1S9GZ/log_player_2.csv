"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is $200. It's too expensive for you. You'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $200 is still too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

While $150 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your $100 limit. You'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
