"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,6,
