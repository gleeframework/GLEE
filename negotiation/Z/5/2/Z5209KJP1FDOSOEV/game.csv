"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on it. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to make a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  which still gives you a significant discount from your estimated value.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
