Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling my willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John if his offer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I know the product is worth more to Bob ($15,000), so there's room for negotiation to reach a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to secure a deal closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident this product will be well worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, reinforcing the potential benefit for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation may result in a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to reach my desired range. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, providing a safe and certain outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
