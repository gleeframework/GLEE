"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her value for the product and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While we don't want to insult Alice, starting significantly lower than her initial offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""a little high for me"") makes the counteroffer seem less arbitrary. 
* **Showing Interest:**  We express continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No Movement:** Alice hasn't actually changed her offer from the first round. Calling it a ""significant discount"" is misleading.
* **Staying Firm:** We need to show Alice that we're serious about a lower price and won't be swayed by sales tactics.  
* **Time Constraint:**  We have time to negotiate, and there's no need to settle for a price we're not comfortable with, especially when we have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, to be honest, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending on this product. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Effort:** We recognize Alice's attempt (even if disingenuous) to find a middle ground. This helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Firm but Fair:** We stand firm on our need for a lower price while proposing a specific number that shows movement on our side.
* **Strategic Movement:**  A $1,000 increase from our previous offer shows we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost. We're aiming for a price closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and her first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,500, which is a good compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice has lowered her price, the progress is slow. We are still significantly above our target price.
* **Testing Resolve:**  By continuing to reject, we're gauging how flexible Alice is willing to be. She may be getting anxious to close the deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  We still have John's offer as a safety net, so we can afford to be a bit more aggressive in our negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  To be completely transparent, I'm aiming to keep this purchase closer to $10,000. Would you be open to a price of $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** We're being more open about our target budget to nudge Alice towards a more realistic price.
* **Small Concession:** We're making a smaller counteroffer this time ($500) to signal we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Direct Question:**  We end with a direct question about her willingness to consider our price, encouraging a clear response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not Quite:**  Alice is getting very close to our acceptable price range, but we're still aiming for $10,500.
* **Time Remaining:**  We have three rounds left, which is enough time to potentially close the gap further.
* **Calculated Risk:**  While there's a risk Alice won't budge much further, it's worth one more counteroffer, especially since we have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I can tell we both want to make this deal happen. How about we split the difference - $10,750, and we have an agreement?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""we both want to make this deal happen,"" we inject a subtle sense of urgency into the negotiation.
* **Compromise:**  Splitting the difference is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  While not explicitly our ""final offer,""  this counteroffer strongly suggests we're reaching our limit. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, I still need to make a bit more than $10,750 to meet my minimum requirement. How about we try $11,250? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice seems fixated on $11,250.  She rejected our split-the-difference offer and increased her price again. It's unlikely she'll move much lower.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're in the penultimate round. Continuing with Alice has a high risk of ending without a deal, forcing us to accept John's higher offer anyway.
* **Acceptable Loss:** While not ideal, buying from John at $15,000 is within our budget. It's better to secure the product at this point than risk losing it entirely."
