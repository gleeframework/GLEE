"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  To show my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still provides you with a good value. Let's make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While that price is getting closer, I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. Could we do $950,000? That would work well for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
