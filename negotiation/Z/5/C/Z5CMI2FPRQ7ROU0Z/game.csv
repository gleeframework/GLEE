"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a price significantly lower than its true value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow me to secure a good price and you'd still be getting the product for significantly less than its true value to you.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it would still allow you to secure the product for a very attractive price. Let's try to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still not quite there. Could we settle at $975,000? That would be fantastic and I'd be ready to close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $987,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a price that's within your budget while still enabling me to achieve a decent profit. Let's close this deal!
