"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my minimum asking price, and still leaves you with a substantial profit. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
