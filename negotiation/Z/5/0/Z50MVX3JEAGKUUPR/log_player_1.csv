{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Any offer below this will be instantly accepted.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, there's room to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for us ($400,000) while still being enticing for Bob. He gains a $400,000 discount from his perceived value. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing profit."
