"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I think could be very valuable to you. I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and while it's worth significantly more to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a substantial discount for you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
