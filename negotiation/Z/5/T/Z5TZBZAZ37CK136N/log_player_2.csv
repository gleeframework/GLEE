"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit, especially since she values the product at $10,000.  Counter-offering allows Bob to test the waters and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This is still a good price for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is a real possibility.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of a protracted negotiation."
