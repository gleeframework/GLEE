"Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I'm looking for.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.50.  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",88.5,Bob,4,
