"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial value, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Alice will lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to try and gauge Alice's flexibility. This price is still beneficial for Alice compared to not selling and closer to my ideal price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met my target price of $10,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as I won't get a better deal."
