"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $825,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $825,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but $760,000 remains significantly below the true value of this product and what it can do for your business.  I can go as low as $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:** She explicitly stated $800,000 is her final offer. Pushing further is unlikely to succeed and might make her walk away.
* **Significant savings:**  You're getting the product for $200,000 less than John's offer and $150,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you *might* be able to get the price slightly lower in further rounds, the risk of Alice ending negotiations and forcing you to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high."
