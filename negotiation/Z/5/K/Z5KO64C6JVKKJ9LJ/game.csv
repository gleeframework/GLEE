"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $825,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value you'll gain.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $825,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but $760,000 remains significantly below the true value of this product and what it can do for your business.  I can go as low as $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
