"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $115. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
