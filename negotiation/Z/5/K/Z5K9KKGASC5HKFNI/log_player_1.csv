"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair return on your investment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,250. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and  I'm getting a fair return on my investment.  It's also likely that I'll have a difficult time getting a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
