"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its inherent value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start high to give ourselves room to negotiate downwards while staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Testing the waters:**  This first offer gauges Bob's enthusiasm and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer leaves a potential profit for Bob ($50,000), showing him that a mutually beneficial deal is possible.

By starting high and engaging in a friendly, professional manner, we set the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  He clearly sees value in the product, and we have room to work towards a price closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,120,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We lower our price by $30,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Highlighting Bob's Potential Gain:** We emphasize that even at our counteroffer, Bob stands to gain considerably ($80,000).
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price halfway between our previous offer and his, we signal fairness and a desire to find common ground. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and maintains a balance between assertiveness and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I can offer $1,080,000. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the increments are still small. We need to show him that we're willing to walk away if we don't get a price closer to our target. By rejecting this offer, we maintain a firm stance and signal that we value the product highly.  We're still open to negotiation, but not at the cost of significant profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a suitable price. However, I need to be upfront â€“ to make this deal worthwhile for me, I can't go below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm hopeful you'll agree."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We make a smaller concession this round ($20,000) but frame it as our final offer to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Justification:**  We re-emphasize the product's value and reiterate that this price is our bottom line.
* **Limited Flexibility:**  While we've softened our stance slightly, we're signaling that we're willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet us closer to our target. 

This approach balances firmness with a willingness to compromise and puts the decision firmly in Bob's hands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your clarification. I understand your position, and I respect the value of the product. However, I am unable to move beyond $1,070,000. I hope this meets somewhere between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows minimal movement ($10,000) and he seems anchored to a price significantly lower than our target. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing the negotiation would likely involve small concessions and consume valuable time with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Bob. 

While there's a chance Bob might eventually increase his offer, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of prolonged negotiation and potentially losing John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure a reasonable profit."
