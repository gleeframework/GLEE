"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($9,500 vs $10,000).**
* **You can get the product for a lower price from John ($10,000).** 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even though it's a bit more expensive, as it's still within your budget."
