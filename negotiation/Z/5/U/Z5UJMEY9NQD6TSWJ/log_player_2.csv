"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still more than Alice's valuation of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, I'm hoping to secure it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is now offering $11,000, which is lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **There's little room for further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the difference between Alice's offer and his maximum price is only $500.  There's a good chance Alice won't budge much more, and the risk of losing the deal isn't worth the potential savings.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money and secure the product."
