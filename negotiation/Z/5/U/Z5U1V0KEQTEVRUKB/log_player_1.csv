I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 

I believe this price is ambitious but reasonable, considering the product's value to me.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that selling to Bob at this price is the best course of action.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing a sale and settling for the lower price with John isn't worth it."
