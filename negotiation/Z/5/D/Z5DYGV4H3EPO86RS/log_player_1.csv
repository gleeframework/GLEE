"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for cheap.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum, it's still lower than the $100 you initially offered. You have 8 more rounds and Bob has shown interest, so it's worth continuing to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is tempting, you've already moved significantly from your original offer. There's still room for negotiation, and with 6 rounds remaining, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $93.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. You've already moved significantly from your initial offer of $100, and with 4 rounds left, you're getting close to your minimum price. It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
