"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,001, which is just a slight premium to what you've mentioned you're willing to pay. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200001.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to start the negotiation. However,  $1,200,001 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is your target price, but I'm afraid it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a $50,000 increase from your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's try to find common ground here.",1180000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is just $20,000 above your target price. This is as high as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
