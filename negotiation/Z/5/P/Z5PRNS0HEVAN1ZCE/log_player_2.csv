"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,500?"",

This counter-offer aims to establish a lower starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation while remaining above Alice's valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $8,000 even? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but respectful:** This message acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while firmly stating a desired price.
* **Targeting Alice's valuation:** Offering $8,000 matches Alice's known product value.  While there's a chance Alice might hold out for slightly more, this is a strong offer likely to be accepted or lead to a minimal counter. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  While $8,000 is the target, there's a small buffer to John's $10,000 price in case one more round of back-and-forth is needed."
