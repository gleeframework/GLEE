"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000.

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your revised offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'll offer the product to you for $1300000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product is worth more than $1200000.
