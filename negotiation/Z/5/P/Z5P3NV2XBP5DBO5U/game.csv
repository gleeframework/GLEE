"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $12,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. I hope you'll consider my counteroffer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
