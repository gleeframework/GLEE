"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $12,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is far above your desired price of $8,000.  It's worthwhile to counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product.

While $11,000 is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my price point."
