{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Addressing Bob's value:** I'm acknowledging the product's worth to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The price isn't unreasonable, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer without immediately rejecting the deal.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** While I want to maximize my profit, I don't want to risk losing Bob and then being forced to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's rejection and counteroffer shows he's interested.  There's still room to negotiate. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John at this moment would secure a higher price, but I believe I can potentially get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $10,500, demonstrating my flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $10,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's within a range where I'm comfortable potentially accepting.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for final negotiation:**  There's still room to move up or down slightly, depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve a reasonable outcome. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum, but not enough:** While $9,500 is higher than Bob's previous offer, it's still well below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems Bob is unlikely to budge further.
* **Opportunity cost:**  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high.  If I continue and Bob rejects my counteroffer, I may be forced to accept a lower price than John's offer. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
