"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while acknowledging your market conditions. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope you'll reconsider. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $950,000 or lower. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",950000.0,Bob,6,,
