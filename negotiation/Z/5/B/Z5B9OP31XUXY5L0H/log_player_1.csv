""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value highly. I believe a price of $12,000 would be fair considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alice's Minimum Acceptable Price:** Alice needs to make at least $8,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $8,000 and $15,000.

By offering the product at $12,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  This price is significantly above her minimum and captures a large portion of the potential profit within the ZOPA.
2. **Increase Likelihood of Acceptance:** While a higher offer might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal. $12,000 leaves Bob with a perceived gain, making acceptance more likely.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,000. He might negotiate for a lower price. However, this initial offer positions Alice strategically within the negotiation."
