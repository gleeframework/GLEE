"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's within a reasonable price range.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. I think it's a fair price that balances both our interests.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While I understand this is valuable to you, $14,000 is still pushing beyond what I'm comfortable with. My absolute maximum would be $12,500.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but no lower. I think this is the best compromise we can reach considering the product's value to me. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept.",13000.0,Alice,7,
