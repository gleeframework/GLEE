Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but no lower. I think this is the best compromise we can reach considering the product's value to me. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her refusing and me missing out on the product is getting too high.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees I stay within my budget and get the product."
