Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to buy the product for $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and I believe that's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's try to reach an agreement on this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer of $1,300,000 ensures a good profit without risking the deal entirely by being too aggressive."
