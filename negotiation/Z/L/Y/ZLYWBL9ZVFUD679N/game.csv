"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
