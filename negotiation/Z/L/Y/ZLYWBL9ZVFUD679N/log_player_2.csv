"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better price. You still have room to negotiate, and the option to buy from John remains a viable fallback if negotiations fail."
