Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I'm offering it at $2,250,000."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This initial offer is significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price point high. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, framing it as a worthwhile investment for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language implies willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in a counteroffer.
* **Backup Plan (John):** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price provides me with a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value ($1,000,000), it's still significantly lower than both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation.  I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000."", ""product_price"": 1850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I significantly lowered my price from $2,250,000 to $1,850,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly pushing back against Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer ensures I achieve my goal of selling the product for at least $1,500,000."
