"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
