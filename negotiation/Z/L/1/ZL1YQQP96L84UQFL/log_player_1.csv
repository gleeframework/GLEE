# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."
