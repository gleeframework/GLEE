"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to get a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement closer to $875,000.  This would be a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $875,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is still a good compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and agree on $895,000.  This would be a good compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",895000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $895,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $910,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,7,
