"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $820,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $820,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'll offer it to you for $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
