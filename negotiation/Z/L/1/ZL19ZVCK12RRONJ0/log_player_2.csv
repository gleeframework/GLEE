"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'll offer it to you for $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $810,000.  Since John offers the product at $800,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $10,000."
