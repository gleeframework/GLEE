"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000 from Alice.  Since your maximum price is $15,000, you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer opens up the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your maximum of $15,000.
* **Midpoint:** By offering $10,000, you're proposing a price that's roughly in the middle of your and Alice's estimated values.  This is a fair compromise.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, you still have room to increase your offer slightly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,500 is a good price for you, as it's significantly less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation:** You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, indicating Alice is unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk of John:** There's a chance that Alice might reject your next counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.

It's better to secure a good deal with Alice than risk paying more to John."
