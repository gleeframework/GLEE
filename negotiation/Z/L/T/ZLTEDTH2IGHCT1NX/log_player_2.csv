"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! The price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious buyers. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important for successful negotiation. We express our interest and frame the counteroffer respectfully."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down in price, which is good, but we still have room to negotiate. We're closer to a price that works for both of us, so we'll continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $85 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $92?"",
""product_price"": 92
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We want to show Alice that we're willing to move closer to her price, hence the compromise at $92. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $92 keeps us below our maximum budget while also being a significant jump from our previous offer. This might encourage Alice to make a more substantial move next."
