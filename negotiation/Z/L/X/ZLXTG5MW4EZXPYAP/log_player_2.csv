Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $100? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price and within my budget.  I'm not sure I can get it any lower, so accepting this offer is the best option."
