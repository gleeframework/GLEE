"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $100? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
