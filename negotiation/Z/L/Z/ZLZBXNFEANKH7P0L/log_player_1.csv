"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I understand if this is not feasible, but I thought I'd ask. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
