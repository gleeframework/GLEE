"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a fair deal considering the quality and value it offers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $9,500.  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
