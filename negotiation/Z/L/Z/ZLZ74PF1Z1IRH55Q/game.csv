"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
