Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This initial high price serves two purposes:
    * It establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation, maximizing my potential profit.
    * It forces Bob to consider the value of the product and potentially present a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest level. 
* I will be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response, but this initial offer sets the stage for a potentially profitable exchange."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still do better.  Bob's initial counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate, so I will use this opportunity to explore a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm reducing my price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
*  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer. This is closer to my desired price range and represents a good compromise.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Bob backing out or further lowering his offer is high. Accepting his offer ensures a sale above my minimum and minimizes the risk of losing a deal."
