"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $1,175,000? That gives you some room for profit and keeps me closer to my target price.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to go up to $1,150,000 for your product. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This would still leave you with a healthy profit margin while getting me closer to my desired outcome.  Let's try to close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider $1,180,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to conclude this transaction.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
