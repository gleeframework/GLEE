"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a reasonable offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still not close enough to my minimum. I believe I can still push for a better price, especially considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $950,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll be forced to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with the cost. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, and it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm confident that John will buy the product from me for $1,000,000."
