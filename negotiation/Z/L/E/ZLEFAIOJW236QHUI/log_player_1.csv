Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150** is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* This approach allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, while also establishing a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is more than my minimum value of $120, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial ask.  This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $130 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $140? This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've countered with $140, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message reinforces the value proposition for Bob and attempts to persuade him with a ""great value"" argument. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further back and forth with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $135 is close to my minimum value of $120 and is also better than selling to John for $120. It's a fair compromise and ensures a sale at a reasonable price.  Accepting this offer allows me to move on without risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
