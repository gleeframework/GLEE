"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a good price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. ",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $13,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $13,500, which would be $14,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before time runs out.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $14,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. While $14,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,750. This is my final offer, as we're running out of time. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options.",13750.0,Bob,8,
