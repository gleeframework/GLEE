Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it would be a great value for you at $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $100 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum threshold.
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and discuss the price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $95 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise.

* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer keeps a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to future deals."
