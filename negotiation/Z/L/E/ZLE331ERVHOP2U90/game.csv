"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and allows me to ensure I get a fair price. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
