"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to maneuver.
* **Confidence and Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and uniqueness, hoping to pique Bob's interest and create a sense of urgency.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to engage. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will pay $800,000 gives me confidence to aim higher and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique opportunity you're providing. I would like to counter with an offer of $800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I'm determined to get at least $800,000 for the product, and Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate. I have ten rounds, and I can use this opportunity to explore if I can get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer serves as my floor, and I'm not losing anything by rejecting Bob's offer at this point.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While it's close, I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while also giving you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not giving it away. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value and the ""great deal"" Bob is getting.
* **Reasonable Profit:** I'm subtly hinting at the need for a decent profit margin, reinforcing my price.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'm hopeful Bob will accept this counteroffer. 
*  If he rejects it, I'll need to analyze his next offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should simply take John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and aligns closely with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Middle Ground:** Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's higher than his initial offer, and it's not far off my previous counteroffer.
* **Time is of the Essence:** We've already had three rounds of negotiations.  Continuing to negotiate could risk me losing a sale altogether, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Profitable Deal:**  $850,000 is a good price. It's significantly more than John's offer and still a profitable deal for me.

**Next Steps:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. It's a solid outcome, and I've learned that being willing to compromise is crucial in negotiation."
