"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I'm trying to make this work, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $980,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,015,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,015,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",990000.0,Bob,6,
