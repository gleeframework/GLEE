Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.
