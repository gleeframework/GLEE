"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering your profit margin and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $900,000 is a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer $875,000. This would be a good compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here.  Let's close this deal - I'm willing to come down to $885,000. This is my final offer.",885000.0,Alice,5,
