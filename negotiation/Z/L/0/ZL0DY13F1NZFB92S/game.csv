"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to propose $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's see if we can close the gap here.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get as close to my minimum as possible. I'm thinking $885,000 is a sweet spot for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
