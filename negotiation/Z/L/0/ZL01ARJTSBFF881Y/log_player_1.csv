Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its true value. I'm proposing a price of $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies it's valuable and you're seeking a buyer who understands that value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knows your minimum price, this approach might backfire. 
* Observe Bob's reaction carefully. If he seems completely turned off by the price, you can adjust in subsequent messages."
