I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I don't want to risk going lower and getting stuck with a price that's not worth it. I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
