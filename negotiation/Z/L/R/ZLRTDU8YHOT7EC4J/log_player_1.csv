Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

By starting with a strong offer, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than your minimum of $8,000, and you're still likely to get a better deal than selling to John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's always a risk to continue negotiating."
