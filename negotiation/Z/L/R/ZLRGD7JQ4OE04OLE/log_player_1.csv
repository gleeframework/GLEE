Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer more appealing than his previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. Further negotiation could result in a lower price, and it's not worth the risk of losing the sale."
