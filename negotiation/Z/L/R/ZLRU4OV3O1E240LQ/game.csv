"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $9,000? That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a fair price for the value this product delivers.  Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, let's be realistic. I've already come down significantly. I'm firm on $9,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",9000.0,Alice,7,
