Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer based on the mutual interests involved. We would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. We believe this price strikes a balance between reflecting the product's value and accommodating your budget. We look forward to your feedback and hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's better to continue negotiating to see if you can get a lower price. There's still room to bargain since Alice's minimum value is $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given our earlier conversation, I believe $1,050,000 reflects a fair value for this product.  Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After reviewing your proposal, we've decided to adjust our position slightly. We would like to suggest a price of $1,075,000 for the product. We believe this reflects a fair compromise while still acknowledging the value you place on the item. We hope this offer will facilitate a successful transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is just within your budget.  It's a good deal for both of you, as it's above Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000 and below your maximum of $1,500,000. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions from Alice, but there's a risk she might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
