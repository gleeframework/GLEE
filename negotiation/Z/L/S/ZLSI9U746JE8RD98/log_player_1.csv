"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing my product is worth at least that to me. It's a strong opening move, and I'm confident I can negotiate down from there if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's significantly below what I consider fair. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm  not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm making it clear that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm also willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  $1,050,000 is a good middle ground and I'm hopeful Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but it's starting to get risky.  I'm concerned Bob might continue to lowball me, and I'm not sure I can get to my minimum price before I run out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm guaranteed a fair price with John."
