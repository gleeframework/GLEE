"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring further negotiation before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can find a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is getting closer to my ideal price point, and it's worth considering.  I'm still saving a significant amount compared to John's price, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  Accepting this offer seems like the best option."
