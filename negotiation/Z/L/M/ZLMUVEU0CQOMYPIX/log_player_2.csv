Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,375,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,387,500.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,387,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,387,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,387,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is getting close:** Alice has made significant concessions, and further negotiation may not result in a much lower price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that if Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might walk away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob could try to negotiate a bit lower, accepting this offer is a good compromise that gets Bob the product within his budget and avoids potential risks."
