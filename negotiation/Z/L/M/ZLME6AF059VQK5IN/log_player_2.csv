"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $17000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a lower negotiation range.  This is a bold move, but it reflects Bob's willingness to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $16000? It's a fair compromise and reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum $15,000.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate, as he has room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can close it here."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. The offer of $15,500 is closer to Alice's desired price, potentially making it more appealing to her.  However, it's still below the $15,000 that Bob can get from John, giving him leverage."
