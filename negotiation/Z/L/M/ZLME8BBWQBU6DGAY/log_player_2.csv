"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This is a fair compromise and a solid deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still over his budget.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close to a stalemate. Bob is better off buying from John for $800,000 to ensure a deal within his budget."
