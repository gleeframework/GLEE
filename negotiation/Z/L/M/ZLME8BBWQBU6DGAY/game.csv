"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm unfortunately not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us as it's closer to your desired price while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This is a fair compromise and a solid deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",925000.0,Alice,5,
