Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room and gives me a good starting point to see how Bob will react."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which may encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $15,000, I'd prefer to secure that guaranteed profit over risking a further decrease in price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping Bob will come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is still a decent profit for me. If Bob rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I've already lowered my price significantly. Rather than continue to negotiate, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to secure a guaranteed profit."
