"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation.  I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping to get a good deal, but not leave him feeling like he's getting ripped off.  I also need to keep in mind that I can sell to John for $10,000, so I want to make sure I don't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $9,000 is too low.  I know the product is worth $10,000 to him, so I'm hoping to get closer to that number.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's also closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I'm hoping that this will be a good compromise and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a price closer to my target.  $10,500 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping that Bob will see it that way.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
