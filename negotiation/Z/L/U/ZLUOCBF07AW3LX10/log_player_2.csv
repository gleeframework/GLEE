"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, I want to try and get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting her initial offer will allow me to counteroffer and potentially save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and $925,000 is too close to that maximum. I'll reject her offer and try to get her to go lower."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer it to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, so if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, $912,500 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of losing the product altogether."
