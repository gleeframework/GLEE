"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer it to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, so if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",912500.0,Alice,5,
