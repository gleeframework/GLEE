Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to bite. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Leaving some room for negotiation allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $100 gives me the confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Counter-offering:**  I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John will pay $100 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $85.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price.
* **Clear Communication:**  I'm explicitly stating that $70 is too low, but I'm open to compromise. This keeps the negotiation transparent.
* **Leveraging John:**  I'm confident that John's offer of $100 allows me to hold out for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already made a significant concession by going down to $85. Further negotiations are unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
