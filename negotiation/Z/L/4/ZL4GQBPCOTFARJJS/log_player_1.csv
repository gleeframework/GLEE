"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept it and sell the product to him.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I'm already at my minimum."
