Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $11,500. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be positive and emphasize the value of the product for Bob.  

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000. However, I'm being realistic, knowing that Bob might not accept a price that high. By starting with a slightly lower price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially reach a compromise. If he rejects, I can always go back to John for my guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could sell it to him and get something, it's not worth sacrificing that much money, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'll try to find a compromise that's still favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I understand your position, but my minimum selling price is $11,000. This still allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his $9,500. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm being direct, but also respectful, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and emphasizing the need for compromise. I'm reminding him that there's still room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm hoping to convince Bob to raise his offer slightly, while also showing that I'm open to negotiation. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10500. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to go with John, who will pay $12,000. 

**Strategy:**

It's important to weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing the deal. In this case, a $1,500 difference from my ideal price is better than the possibility of getting nothing from Bob and then having to settle for John's $12,000 offer."
