"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  How about we try $100 even?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we try $130? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,
