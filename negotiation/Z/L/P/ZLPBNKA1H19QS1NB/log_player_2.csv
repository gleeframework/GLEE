"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $115, saving you $5.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means paying more.** You'd end up paying $120 to John."
