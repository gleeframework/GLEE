Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he has incentive to accept and still gain value.
* **It sets a clear starting point:** A specific price makes it clear what you're looking for and avoids vague offers.

Keep in mind, this is just the beginning!  You'll need to analyze Bob's response and adapt your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $950,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I think this might be closer to what we can agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly values the product at over $850,000, so you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a deal closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I still feel that $900,000 is quite high. Could we possibly negotiate down to $875,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While $875,000 is still a bit lower than your preferred price, it's very close to your minimum acceptable offer.  Given that Bob is consistently declining your offers,  it's likely that he might not budge further.  

Accepting his offer guarantees you a sale and a significant profit. While you might get slightly more by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's offer at $800,000 is high."
