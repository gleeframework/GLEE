"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to meet my needs.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
