"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Alternative:** While I'm optimistic about negotiating with Bob, I'm keeping my backup option (selling to John) in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and we can continue negotiating. 
* **Time Remaining:** We're only in round 2, so I have ample time to try to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate by offering a counter-proposal.
* **Bridging the Gap:** $850,000 is a compromise that meets me halfway between my previous offer and Bob's proposal.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum threshold of $1,200,000, but the offer is more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage continued negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Threshold:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $1,200,000 I need to make this sale worthwhile. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to reach a more favorable price.
* **Time Remaining:** We are only in round 4, so there's time to continue negotiating without rushing into an unfavorable deal.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's desire for a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to meet my needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise further.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Sort of):** $800,000 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, but it's closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is a fair price that gives him value for the product.
* **Time is Running:** We're halfway through the negotiations. It's time to get closer to a deal."
