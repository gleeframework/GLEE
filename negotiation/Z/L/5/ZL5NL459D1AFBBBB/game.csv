"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $1250000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This price is a good compromise, and I believe we can close the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm offering you a price of $1200000. This is my best offer so far, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $1200000 is still out of my budget.  I can offer you $1150000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiations. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering you a price of $1200000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best deal you'll get. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
