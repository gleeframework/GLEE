{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Even if we don't get a better price in this round, we gain information and time to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Let's start with a significant discount.  $10,000 is a good starting point to see if Alice is open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $11,500 is still too high.  Let's try to squeeze a bit more out of her with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

We're moving in the right direction! Let's try a price in the middle between our last offer and Alice's.  Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our target price.  While we could try to squeeze out another $200, the risk of her walking away or delaying the deal further isn't worth it.  Accepting her offer at $11,200 is a good compromise."
