"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $800,000. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step towards your target price of $800,000. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal. You're aiming to secure a price that is attractive to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $725,000, which is very close to your target price of $800,000.  While you might be able to squeeze out an even lower price with more negotiation, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you'll be left with the option of buying from John at $800,000. It's likely that this is the best deal you'll get from Alice, and accepting the offer minimizes the risk of losing the opportunity entirely."
