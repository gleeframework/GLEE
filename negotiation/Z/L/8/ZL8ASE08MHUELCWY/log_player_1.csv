"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is more than what John is offering, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,250,000.  This price still leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $1,175,000 is a good compromise. It's more than what John is offering, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
