Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,250,000. Accepting this offer secures a $50,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
