"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I believe Bob will be interested in this offer, but he may counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still ensuring a profit closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $11,000, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
