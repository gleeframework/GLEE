"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  This is the highest I can go.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I respect that. $9,250 is close, but I can't go that low.  My final offer is $9,750.  This is a great deal for a product you won't find anywhere else.",9750.0,Alice,5,
