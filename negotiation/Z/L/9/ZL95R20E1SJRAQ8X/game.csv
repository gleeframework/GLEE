"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $8,000 at most for my needs. I'm willing to offer you $6,000. It's a fair starting point for negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $11,000? That's a more reasonable price reflecting its quality and benefits.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $7,000. I need to stick within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need you to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price that ensures you get something incredible without undervaluing what I'm offering.",10000.0,Alice,5,
