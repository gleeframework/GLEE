"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $1,080,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle of the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,055,000. I think we can make a deal at this price.",1055000.0,Alice,7,
