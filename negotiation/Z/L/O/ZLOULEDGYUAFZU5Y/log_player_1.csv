Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible while ensuring she gets more than John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, increasing the chance of acceptance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher to leave more room for concessions. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might lower the price slightly to increase the chance of an immediate deal."
