"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's tempting to save $2,000 compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $9,150. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's only got three rounds left and Alice is clearly not going to budge much further.  Buying from John will save him $150, which is a better outcome than trying to push for a lower price with Alice."
