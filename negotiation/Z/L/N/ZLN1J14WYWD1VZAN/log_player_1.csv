Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture more value. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, highlighting the potential for him to get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can always turn to John, ensuring I get at least $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $9,500 offers a middle ground, leaving room for a potential final agreement or further negotiation if necessary. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I remain confident that John will purchase the product for $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $9,500.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might not lead to a significantly higher offer.
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting ensures a sale and a good profit, avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I still have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup, but accepting this deal gives me a more immediate and secure outcome."
