,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I can do $150, and that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $155, and that's my final offer on the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I really think we can do better than that. I'm not willing to go above $145, and I'm starting to think about other options.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I can do $150 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my last offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're really close, but I'm not willing to meet you at $150. I can do $142.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",142.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $150, and I think we've already discussed this price multiple times. I'm starting to think you're just trying to lowball me. I'll stick with my original offer of $150, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on.",150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we've discussed the price multiple times, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $150. I'm willing to make one final offer of $142.50, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to buy the product from someone else.",142.5,Bob,10,
