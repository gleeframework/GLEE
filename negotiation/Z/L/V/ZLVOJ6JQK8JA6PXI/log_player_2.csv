Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. I've tried to be flexible in our discussions. To be candid, accepting anything below $900,000 would be difficult given my own valuations. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal today.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price that's too high for you.  While she might come down slightly in further rounds, it's unlikely she'll drop to your target of $800,000.  You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it makes sense to cut your losses and secure the deal with him."
