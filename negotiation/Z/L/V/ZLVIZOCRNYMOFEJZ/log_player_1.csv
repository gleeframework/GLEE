"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay a premium for it. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for $1,100,000, as that's still below my minimum price of $800,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price, but still leave some room for negotiation. I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $950,000.
