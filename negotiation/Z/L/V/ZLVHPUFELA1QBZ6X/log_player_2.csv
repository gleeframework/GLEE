Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this revised price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth and leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up on the price.  However, I need to be straightforward: $1,200,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber.  Its long-term value and potential benefits far exceed the immediate price tag. To be transparent,  I've received significant interest from other potential buyers. However, I value our discussions and believe we can still reach an agreement. Would you be willing to consider a price point closer to $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,400,000. You've already stated your maximum price is $1,200,000, which is John's price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome than buying from John."
