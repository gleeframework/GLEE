"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  It's important for me to get a fair price for this product, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
