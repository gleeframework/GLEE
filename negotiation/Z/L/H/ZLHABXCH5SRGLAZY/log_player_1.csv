{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price higher than the product's value to Bob.  It's important to be assertive yet friendly, leaving room for counteroffers while still maximizing my profit potential.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.  However, I'm also aware of John's offer, providing a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I need to be mindful of John's offer, I'm not willing to sell for $12,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  It's important for me to get a fair price for this product, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and is a reasonable compromise.  It's also closer to John's offer, meaning I'm not losing out too much by accepting.  It's important to end the negotiation at some point, and $13,000 is a good compromise for both of us."
