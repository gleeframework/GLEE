"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still not able to meet at $11,500. I would like to propose $10,500 as it feels closer to the value I can reasonably offer. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I am comfortable moving forward with an offer of $10,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of your item while staying within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,6,
