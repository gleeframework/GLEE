Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, it's worth attempting to sell to Bob for a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $140 creates a win-win scenario if Bob is even slightly flexible on price. This is because:
    * You gain an extra $10 compared to selling to John.
    * Bob saves $10 compared to his alternative of not buying and missing out on the product.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is polite and highlights the value proposition for Bob, increasing the chance of acceptance."
