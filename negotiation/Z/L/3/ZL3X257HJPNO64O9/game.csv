"Alice, thanks for the offer. That product looks great, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my budget limit.  I can do $12,000, but that's really the best I can offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I think you'll see the value in it and be willing to go a bit higher. Let's aim for $13,250.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid we're just too far apart.  $12,200 is my absolute final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",12200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $12,200. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll counter with $13,000, and that's my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,9,
