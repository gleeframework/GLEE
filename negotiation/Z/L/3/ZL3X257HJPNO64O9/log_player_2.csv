"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite close to my maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That product looks great, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to create room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message maintains a positive tone and suggests a willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer gives me bargaining power while still leaving a significant gap between my offer and John's alternative price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still a chance to negotiate further.  I'm not in a hurry and buying from John for $15,000 is still an option if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, showing a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a price significantly below her offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By increasing my offer by a smaller amount, I'm signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Continuing to be polite and respectful will hopefully encourage Alice to keep negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down slightly, but it's a very small concession. I need to show her I'm serious about a lower price or I risk running out of rounds and being forced to accept a higher price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my budget limit.  I can do $12,000, but that's really the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a significant jump in my offer to demonstrate seriousness while still staying within a reasonable range of my budget.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By stating this is the ""best I can offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm nearing the end of the negotiation. 
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to apply a bit more pressure to avoid being left with John's less appealing offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I think you'll see the value in it and be willing to go a bit higher. Let's aim for $13,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to hold out for a higher price, but her concessions are minimal. I'm not willing to settle for a price this close to John's offer with only a few rounds left. I need to push harder or consider buying from John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid we're just too far apart.  $12,200 is my absolute final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 12200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it very clear that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Small Concession:** The slight increase from my previous offer shows good faith, but I'm not budging much.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that I'm willing to walk away from the deal and buy from John.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, I need to force a decision from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've made your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $12,200. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll counter with $13,000, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price too close to John's offer.  There's little chance she'll come down significantly in the last round. It's not worth the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and leaving me with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
