"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know it's worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum. This should give him room to negotiate while still leaving me a considerable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to keep expenses low, but $750,000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd like, but it's close to my minimum acceptable price and a significant improvement over his previous offer. Accepting this deal ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, which is better than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
