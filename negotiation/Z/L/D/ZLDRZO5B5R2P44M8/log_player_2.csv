"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is good, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore further options and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate and potentially pushing Alice towards a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and is within Bob's budget.  It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $150,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer is the best option for Bob at this point."
