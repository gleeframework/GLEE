"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know it's worth at least $12000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
