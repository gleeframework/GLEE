It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is unlikely to budge much further. You've been incrementally increasing your offers, and she's been incrementally decreasing hers. You're reaching a point where the potential savings from another round are small. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If you push further and Alice walks, you're stuck with John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting $915,000 guarantees a significant saving compared to that.
* **Time Constraint:** You're running out of rounds.  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the last round isn't worth the risk of losing the product altogether."
