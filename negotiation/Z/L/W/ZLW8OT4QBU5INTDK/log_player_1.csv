Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering the product at $140 ensures you still make a significant profit even if Bob manages to negotiate a small discount. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, so you can afford to be firm on price. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style or how much he's willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob, you might adjust your approach."
