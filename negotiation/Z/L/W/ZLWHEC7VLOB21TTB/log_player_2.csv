Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's budget. He can save $5,000 by buying from John, which is the best option for him in this scenario."
