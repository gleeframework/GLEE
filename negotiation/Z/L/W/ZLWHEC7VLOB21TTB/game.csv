"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $14,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's a price that fits within my budget while also allowing you to make a reasonable profit.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'll make a new offer of $17,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while also being reasonable for you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
