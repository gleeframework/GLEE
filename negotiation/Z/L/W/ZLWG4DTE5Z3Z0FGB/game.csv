"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your patience with this negotiation. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $12,100? It's a small adjustment, but it would help me feel comfortable closing the deal.",12100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $12,100 is still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $11,900? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11900.0,Bob,6,
