Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for counteroffers, as this is a negotiation. I can always lower the price a bit if needed.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer and counteroffers become too low, I can confidently walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** While I could try to get a bit more, the potential gains are small, and further negotiation risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and easy sale, which is valuable. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** If Bob had offered a price lower than $150, I would have rejected and sold to John."
