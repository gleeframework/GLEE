Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value the product at $1,200,000 and I'm happy to sell it for a slight premium. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,300,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for myself. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Knowing My Floor:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum, so I can be firm in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, fantastic! I've secured a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable or if I want to counter back.  
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would result in a loss.
* **John is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, so I can afford to be patient and negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to keep the negotiations moving while also protecting my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering your value for the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $1,250,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  The message highlights that this price is still a good deal for Bob while also communicating my commitment to finding a solution.
* **Avoid going too low:** I don't want to immediately drop to $1,200,000, as this might make me seem desperate and could limit my bargaining power in future rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've achieved a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and make a decision based on the remaining negotiation time and my willingness to reach a deal. 
* If negotiations stall, I can always revert to John's offer of $1,200,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1150000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would result in a loss for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'm not keen on losing out on a sale, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but I will try to be creative in my counteroffer to encourage him to meet me in the middle. I might suggest a compromise like a smaller down payment or a payment schedule.
* **Time is a factor:** I will consider how much time I want to invest in negotiations. If Bob seems unwilling to budge, I might need to accept John's offer to avoid losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to meet your needs while still securing a reasonable price for the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  $1,175,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a genuine attempt to meet halfway and find a workable solution. 
* **Focus on closing the deal:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and move forward. 
* **Still above minimum:**  While it's closer to my floor, this price still allows me to make a profit.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a profitable sale while maintaining a good relationship with the buyer.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to weigh my options carefully.  Is he willing to negotiate further?  How much time am I willing to invest? 
* **John's offer:**  If negotiations stall, I can always revert to John's offer of $1,200,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to meet me at $1160000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is still too low:**  $1,160,000 is only $40,000 above my minimum, which isn't enough to justify the time and effort invested in negotiations. 
* **John's offer is a better deal:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.  
* **Minimizing risk:** It's better to secure a profitable sale with John rather than risk further negotiations with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge.

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale at $1,200,000.  This ensures a profitable outcome and avoids further frustration with Bob's negotiations."
