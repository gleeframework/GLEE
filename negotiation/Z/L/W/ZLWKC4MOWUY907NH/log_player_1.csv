"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counter-offer, and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm reducing my price from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the negotiation in terms of finding a solution that benefits both of us, hoping to build trust and encourage Bob to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  I'm close to my minimum acceptable price with John, and I don't want to risk closing a deal with Bob that falls below my target. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,500,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" and beneficial for both parties, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:**  This is a good opportunity to close the deal, as it's my minimum acceptable price. However, if Bob rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob seems willing to negotiate, it's possible that we could end up in a stalemate or that Bob will not increase his offer significantly further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of further negotiations with Bob is not worth the potential loss of profit.  

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of a protracted negotiation that might result in a lower price."
