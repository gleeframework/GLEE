"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and try to find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my finances. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
