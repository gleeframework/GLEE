Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still thinking $100 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Even though Bob is offering me $100, I've already gone down to $110 and he's not budging.  It's clear we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm not willing to risk more rounds of negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale to John at a price that's more profitable for me."
