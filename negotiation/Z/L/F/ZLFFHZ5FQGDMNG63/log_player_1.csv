"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can start working our way down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right now.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with something higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more palatable offer for Bob while still ensuring I get a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to take $16,000. It's closer to my ideal than John's offer and saves me the time and energy of continuing negotiations."
