Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still be a significant profit for you and within my acceptable range.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
