"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:** $120 is less than your $150 maximum and significantly cheaper than John's $150 offer. 
* **Gets you the product:**  You achieve your goal of buying the product."
