"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair deal for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
