(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals that I'm aware of its value and not willing to overpay.  I'm leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a better price.  Buying from John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to meet Alice halfway. I'm still below my maximum budget and hoping to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate. Buying from John is always an option, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally reaching my maximum budget with this offer. If Alice accepts, I've achieved my goal of getting the product at a price that's valuable to me. If she rejects, I'm going to buy from John as further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price."
