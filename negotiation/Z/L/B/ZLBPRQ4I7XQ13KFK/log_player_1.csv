"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also shows that I value the product.  I'm confident I can get at least $15,000 from John if the deal falls through with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I have the option to sell to John.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm coming down to $15,500. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm serious about making a deal with Bob. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm confident he'll accept this offer. If not, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price.  I'm happy to accept this offer, as it meets my minimum requirements and avoids the risk of going through more negotiation rounds."
