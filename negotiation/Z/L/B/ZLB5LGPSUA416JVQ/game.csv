"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,750. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,750 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000. Would you consider $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can meet you halfway between $11,250 and $11,750, which is $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
