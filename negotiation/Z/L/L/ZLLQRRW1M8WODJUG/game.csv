"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get a bit more than that. How about we aim for $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19500. Can we meet at this price?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $20500? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",20500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $20500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $19000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",19000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $20000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $19500. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",19500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about we meet at $20250? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options.",20250.0,Alice,9,
