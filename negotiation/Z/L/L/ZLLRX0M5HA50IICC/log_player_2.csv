"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is still a significant markup from what it's worth to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Respectful Tone:** We want to maintain a positive negotiation environment, even while countering.
* **Target Price:** Our ideal price is somewhere between $80 (Alice's value) and $150 (our maximum).  $90 is a reasonable opening shot within that range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. Moving from $120 to $105 shows flexibility.
* **Room for Improvement:** We're still above our target price. There's room to negotiate further down towards $90.
* **Alternative:** We always have the option of John at $150, so we're not desperate. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle right in the middle at $97.50? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price exactly between her last offer ($105) and our last counteroffer ($90). This signals fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Specificity:** Using a specific number like $97.50 can sometimes make an offer feel more concrete and appealing.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will give us a better idea of how much lower Alice is willing to go."
