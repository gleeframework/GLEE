"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
