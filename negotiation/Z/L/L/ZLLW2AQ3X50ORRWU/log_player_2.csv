Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for staying with us in this negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price.  To meet you closer to your budget, I can do $15,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your $10,000 limit. Her ""final offer"" language also suggests she's not likely to move much further. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it makes sense to take it."
