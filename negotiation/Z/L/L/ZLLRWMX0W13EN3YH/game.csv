"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $88.  That's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $90? I think it's a fair price that's close to what I was originally looking for.",90.0,Alice,5,
