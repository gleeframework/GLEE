"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement at $950,000. This price reflects the value we place on the product and the opportunity it presents to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is significantly above Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and attempt to secure a lower price.
* **Risk of buying from John:**  While buying from John is an option, it's the most expensive choice. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice further to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $900,000 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive compared to the original price of $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $900,000 is still above Alice's own valuation, and while it's lower than her previous offer, it's still too high for Bob to accept.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to push for a lower price and hopefully find a middle ground.
* **Buying from John is too expensive:**  $1,200,000 is a lot more than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This price is a fair middle ground, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
