"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $900,000 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive compared to the original price of $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This price is a fair middle ground, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
