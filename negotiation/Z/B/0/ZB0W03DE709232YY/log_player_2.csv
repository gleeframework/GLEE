Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $11,000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, $11,000 is still over my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I can still get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $10,500, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's a 12% discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still higher than my budget of $10,000.  Even though we're getting closer, I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left, so I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to go up to $11,200.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $10,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a reasonable price for your product while still staying within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking with your last offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $11,000, and I'll throw in a free warranty that's worth $500. So, the total value you'll get is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering a price of $11,000 with a warranty, but this is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the chances of successfully negotiating a lower price are slim.  It's better to buy from John, who is offering the product for my maximum price."
