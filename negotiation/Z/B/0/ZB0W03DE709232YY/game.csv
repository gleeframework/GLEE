"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to make a special deal for you. I'll sell it to you for $12,000, which is a 20% discount from its true value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product and would be happy to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $11,000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $10,500, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's a 12% discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to go up to $11,200.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $10,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a reasonable price for your product while still staying within my budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking with your last offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $11,000, and I'll throw in a free warranty that's worth $500. So, the total value you'll get is $11,500. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
