Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. Aiming for a price slightly below that maximizes potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This knowledge allows you to confidently set a higher price for Bob.
* **Negotiation:** While this is a single offer, leaving some room for negotiation (Bob countering with $13,500, for example) is possible with this approach."
