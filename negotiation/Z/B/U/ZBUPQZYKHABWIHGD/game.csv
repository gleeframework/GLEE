"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is good, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
