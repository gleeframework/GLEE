"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, which is the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a significant stretch for me.  How about we try $700,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
