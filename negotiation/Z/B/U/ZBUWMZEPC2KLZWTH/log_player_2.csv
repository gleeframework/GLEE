"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, we're considering a special offer of $12,000 for it. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's more than fair but still allows us to cover our costs and ensure future investments in quality products. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than what John is offering ($10,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John and secure the product at a lower price, saving $2,000."
