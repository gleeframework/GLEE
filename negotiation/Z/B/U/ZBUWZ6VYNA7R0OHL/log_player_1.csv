Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good practice to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer, moving the price closer to his perceived value of $80.
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above his perceived value of $80, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $90 would mean selling below your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $100, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I could come down to $110 for you. I believe this product is worth every penny, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a concession from your initial price, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. However, the concession is relatively small ($10) to signal you're not desperate.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** The new price of $110 is still above John's standing offer of $100, ensuring you don't lose potential profit by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and potentially justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Upside Potential:** While you could try to negotiate further, Bob has indicated that $95 is his maximum. It's unlikely you'll be able to bridge the gap significantly.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you a $100 sale, avoiding the risk of further unsuccessful negotiation with Bob.

At this point, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit from John rather than risking a lower sale or potentially protracted negotiations with Bob."
