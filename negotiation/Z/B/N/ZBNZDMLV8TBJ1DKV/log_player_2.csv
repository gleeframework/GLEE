Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within your budget and a good deal considering the product's worth to you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best move to secure the product at a favorable price."
