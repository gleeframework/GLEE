Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the benefit to Bob, framing it as a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to continue. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price.
* If the negotiation stalls or goes below my minimum ($10,000), I'll switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John now would only yield $10,000, whereas I believe I can get closer to my target of $14,000 through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $13,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
