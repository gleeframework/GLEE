Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $9,500.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price that balances the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can shake hands on this."", ""product_price"": 9000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue negotiating, Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. He's within his budget and there's a risk that Alice will walk away or he'll have to buy from John for a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
