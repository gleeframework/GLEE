"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I've put into the product, but also takes into account your concerns about the price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $9,500.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price that balances the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your last offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,7,
