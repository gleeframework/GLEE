"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $155?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really keen on getting this product.",155.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,165.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to an agreement. I can see that $155 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $165. It's still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,,
