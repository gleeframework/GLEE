Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the $12,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, our guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $12,000 but lower than our ideal.
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning that the product likely exceeds Bob's estimated value, we reinforce its worth and justify the higher price. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring a profitable sale regardless of his decision."
