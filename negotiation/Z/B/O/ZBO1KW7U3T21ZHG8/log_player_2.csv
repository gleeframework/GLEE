Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $5000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $6000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is the last price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think there's been a mistake. I previously chose to reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John, not make a counteroffer. However, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.
