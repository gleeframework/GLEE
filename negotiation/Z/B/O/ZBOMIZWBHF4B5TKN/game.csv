"Hi Bob, I'm happy to introduce you to this fantastic product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision here.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a drop from my initial offer. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose $9,500. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $9,500 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose $9,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,6,
