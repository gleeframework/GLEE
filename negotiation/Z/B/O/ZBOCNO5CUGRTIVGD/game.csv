"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount for you and still brings me a respectable profit. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,025,000. This offer represents a significant discount for you and ensures I can still secure a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal! ",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $990,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, but $990,000 is simply too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you one last time at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
