"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing negotiations. However, I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. My minimum price is $1500000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a significant profit. My counteroffer is $1225000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
