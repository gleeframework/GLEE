"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's potential for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my value of $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is looking for $1,200,000. There's still room for both sides to find a middle ground. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,060,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,060,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $1,065,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close this negotiation quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,065,000 is only $65,000 above Bob's desired price of $1,000,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might reject further offers, or the negotiation could drag on for too long. 

Given that Bob can buy from John for $1,000,000, this offer is a good compromise that allows Bob to save some money while still securing the product."
