"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my value of $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,060,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,060,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $1,065,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close this negotiation quickly.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
