Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $12,000, giving me a strong negotiating position. I'm not desperate to sell below that price. 

By starting high but reasonable, I increase my chances of:

1. **Bob accepting immediately:**  He gets the product at a price he finds acceptable.
2. **Negotiating a higher final price:**  Even if he counters, the negotiation is likely to stay above my minimum."
