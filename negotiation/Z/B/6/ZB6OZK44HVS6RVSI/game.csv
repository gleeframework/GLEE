"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, especially considering the product's worth.  If we can't come to an agreement, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
