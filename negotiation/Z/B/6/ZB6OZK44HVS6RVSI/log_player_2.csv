Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, especially considering the product's worth.  If we can't come to an agreement, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,600,000?
