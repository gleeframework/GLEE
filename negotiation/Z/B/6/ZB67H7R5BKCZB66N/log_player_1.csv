Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you want to keep it that way.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that captures a significant portion of Bob's potential profit without scaring him off.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" add value perception.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 potential profit, which is still very attractive.
* **No Justification:** Avoid explaining your pricing. Let Bob decide if the value proposition is strong enough.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible approach. You could aim even higher, especially if you have reason to believe Bob places a higher value on the product or is particularly eager to acquire it. 
* Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, but stand firm on a price that's significantly above your $1,000,000 fallback."
