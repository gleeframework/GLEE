"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. After careful consideration, I propose that we discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement where you can purchase this exceptional item for $950,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and my desire to ensure both parties benefit from the transaction. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  Even if Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can still fall back on buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposition of $850,000 for the product. This price aims to find a balance between the value I see in the product and your budget constraints. I am open to further negotiation to reach a satisfactory agreement for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to your budget, it's still slightly higher.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get Alice to come down to your desired price. If she doesn't, you can always buy from John as a backup."

I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
