"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This gives you a great deal, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You can get the product for $12,000 from Alice, compared to $15,000 from John.
* **You save money.** Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, you can still get it for a price that's lower than what you'd pay John."
