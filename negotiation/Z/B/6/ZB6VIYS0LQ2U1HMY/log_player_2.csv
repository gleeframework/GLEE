Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $142.50. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go below $142.50 at this point, and it's better to secure the product from John at $150 than risk getting stuck with no deal and potentially having to pay more elsewhere."
