"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $8,750 is still too low. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",8900.0,Alice,5,
