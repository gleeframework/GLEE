Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's above my minimum:** $115 is more than my minimum price of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $115 is still below the value Bob places on the product ($120), making it likely he'll accept.
* **It's a good backup plan:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $100, avoiding any losses."
