{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100), hoping to get a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to get closer to the $100 value it has to Bob.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't pay more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering the minimum he's willing to pay. While it's tempting to take the $100, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a bit more. I'm hoping I can convince him to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $100. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
I'm splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer to show I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the product's value and my budget, I believe $100 is the maximum I can offer. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not willing to go any lower than $100. Bob seems firm on his offer, and I'm not confident I can convince him to pay more.  Selling to John at this point is the most sensible choice to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price for the product."
