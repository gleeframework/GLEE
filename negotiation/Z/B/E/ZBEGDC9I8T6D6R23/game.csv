"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500 for the product. This would still be a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. This would still leave you with a good profit margin. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $16000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll offer you the product for $15800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15800.0,Alice,5,
