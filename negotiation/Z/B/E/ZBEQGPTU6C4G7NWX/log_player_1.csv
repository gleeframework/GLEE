Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price you're asking is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $500,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident it will yield returns far exceeding that for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its unique value proposition."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product has potential, $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching up, but we're still very far from our minimum. Holding firm and countering strategically is the best path to maximizing profit, rather than accepting a low offer or settling for John's price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value it offers while acknowledging your desire for a more agreeable price."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $750,000.  I need to see some movement from you though. Do you think we can make a deal at this price?

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We are getting close to John's offer but there is still room for Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal, but the product's value justifies a higher price. My final offer is $950,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time constraint:** We're reaching the later rounds, leaving less room for large movements. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  This offer is a strong but fair compromise. It significantly exceeds Bob's current offer while still leaving room for him to negotiate up slightly and us to still beat John's price.
* **Finality:** By stating it's our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make his best move."
