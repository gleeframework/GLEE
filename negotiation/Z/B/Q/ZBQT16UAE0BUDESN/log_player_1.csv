"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me. We'll see if this offer is more appealing to Bob!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.
