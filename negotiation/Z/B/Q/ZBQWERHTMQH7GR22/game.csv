"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value of $1200000. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I'm not willing to go above $1000000.

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm at a point where I need to consider other options, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, but I need a firm commitment from you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $995000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $800000. What do you think?",995000.0,Bob,8,
