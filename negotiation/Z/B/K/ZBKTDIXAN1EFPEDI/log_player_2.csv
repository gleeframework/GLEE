{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $180. It's too expensive, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's a great product, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $165. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$165 is still too high for me, so I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $140?  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, $140 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $155. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $120.  I've already tried to negotiate a lower price, and it doesn't seem like she's willing to go any lower.  It's better to just buy from John at $120 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
