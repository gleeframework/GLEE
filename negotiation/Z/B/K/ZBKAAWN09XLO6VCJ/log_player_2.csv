"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high compared to your alternative option of buying from John for $100. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $140 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It's a significant jump from your previous offer but still keeps you below your maximum budget and leaves space for Alice to potentially counter."
