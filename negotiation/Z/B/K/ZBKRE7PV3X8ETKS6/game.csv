"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we settle on $10,250? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
