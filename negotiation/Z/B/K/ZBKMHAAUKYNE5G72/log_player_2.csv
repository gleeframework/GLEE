"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece with a lot of potential, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to make a deal, so you have time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, taking into account the potential value of the product.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still represents a potential profit for her, considering her minimum price is $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, emphasizing the value you see in the product while making it clear you're not willing to meet her initial price.
* **Next Steps:**  This counteroffer should start the negotiation process. If Alice rejects, you can continue to adjust your counteroffer in subsequent rounds, always keeping in mind your budget limit and the possibility of buying from John for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  You have a few options, but rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Rejecting:**  It shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating and will not simply accept a price above your limit.
* **Counteroffering:**  You can continue to lower the price gradually, ideally getting closer to your desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Buying from John:** While it's tempting, you still have 7 rounds to potentially get a better deal from Alice.  There's no need to rush.

**Remember:** The key is to find a balance between being firm about your budget and staying open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000, but that's still outside of my budget. I believe there's room for us to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you're offering while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This offer is a compromise, increasing your offer from $1,200,000 while still staying below Alice's last offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to give in completely.
* **Message:**  The message is positive but firm,  reiterating your budget constraints and highlighting the compromise you're offering.
* **Next Steps:**  This counteroffer should push the negotiation closer to a resolution. If Alice rejects, you can continue to adjust your counteroffer, but remember your goal is to get the price as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to push for a lower price.

* **Counteroffer:** You can aim for a price around $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's last offer, and it might motivate her to accept or at least come closer to your target price.
* **Buying from John:**  While it's tempting to buy from John now, you have 5 rounds left, and you might be able to achieve a better price with Alice if you keep negotiating.

**Remember:** It's important to be persistent and try to get the best deal possible within your budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to making this deal work, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm offering $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize the agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a final attempt to get the price as close to your budget as possible. It represents a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, showing you are serious about finding a solution.
* **Message:** The message is direct and clear, emphasizing that this is your final offer and leaving the decision in Alice's hands.
* **Next Steps:** This counteroffer is a crucial step. If Alice rejects, you have only 4 rounds remaining before you need to decide whether to buy from John. This final offer puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal entirely."
