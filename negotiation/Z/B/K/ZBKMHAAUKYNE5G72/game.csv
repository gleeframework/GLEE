"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, taking into account the potential value of the product.  Let's discuss this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000, but that's still outside of my budget. I believe there's room for us to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you're offering while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to making this deal work, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm offering $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize the agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
