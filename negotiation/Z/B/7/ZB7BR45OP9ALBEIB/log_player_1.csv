{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and a good price for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This provides room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It's a strong initial offer:** This demonstrates you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're not desperate. 

By starting with a firm but fair offer, you can encourage Bob to engage in productive negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $850,000 for the product. This is closer to what I am willing to pay, while still allowing you to gain a profit. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $900,000 on this sale. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above your minimum:**  $925,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Show flexibility:** You've lowered your initial price, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Bob's logic:** You're emphasizing the good deal he's getting at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer. I believe that $925,000 is still too high for the value I place on this product. I am willing to pay up to $875,000 for it. I hope this proposal is acceptable, as I believe it strikes a fair balance between the value you seek and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob,  $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower, and continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely to drag on.  I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  It guarantees me my minimum and saves time."
