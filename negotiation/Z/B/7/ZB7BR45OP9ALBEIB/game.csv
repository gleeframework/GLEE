"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and a good price for you. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $850,000 for the product. This is closer to what I am willing to pay, while still allowing you to gain a profit. I look forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $900,000 on this sale. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer. I believe that $925,000 is still too high for the value I place on this product. I am willing to pay up to $875,000 for it. I hope this proposal is acceptable, as I believe it strikes a fair balance between the value you seek and my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
