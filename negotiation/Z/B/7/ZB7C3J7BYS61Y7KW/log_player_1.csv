Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $88.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $86? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $86 is still a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
