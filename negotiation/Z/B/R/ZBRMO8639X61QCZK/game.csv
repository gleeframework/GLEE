"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm really hoping we can make this work.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but my budget is firm at $80. If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
