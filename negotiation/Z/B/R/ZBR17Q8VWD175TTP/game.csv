"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,000,  which still reflects the value of the product to me. I hope this is a good middle ground for us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
