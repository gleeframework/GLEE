Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $120, which is the price John is offering. I believe this strategy will maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than his initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe I can secure a better price by counteroffering, as I know John is willing to pay $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still above my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm offering $105, which is still a good deal for Bob as it's $15 above his valuation. It also keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $120, making this a more favorable option than selling to John. This way, I can potentially secure a better price with Bob while avoiding losing out on a potentially higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to adjust. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $100 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  $100 is above Bob's initial valuation, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $120. I'm confident that I can find another buyer who is willing to pay closer to my desired price in the future."
