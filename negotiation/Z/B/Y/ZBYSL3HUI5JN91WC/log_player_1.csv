Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but we are still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I need to see something closer to $1,750,000 to make this work.  This product will bring you significant value and that's a fair price for us both."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product brings value, but $1,750,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  I can offer a maximum of $800,000 for this deal.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond his valuation of the product.  While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's far less than my minimum and what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
