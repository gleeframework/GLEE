"Hi Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. To keep this moving, how about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, but we are still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I need to see something closer to $1,750,000 to make this work.  This product will bring you significant value and that's a fair price for us both.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this product brings value, but $1,750,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  I can offer a maximum of $800,000 for this deal.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
