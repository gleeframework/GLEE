"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000 for this product.  It's a good start, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $900,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
