Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($150) as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $80, you want to aim higher since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price leaves a little wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important:**  While you could offer it at $150, starting slightly lower might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and increase the chance of a quick sale."
