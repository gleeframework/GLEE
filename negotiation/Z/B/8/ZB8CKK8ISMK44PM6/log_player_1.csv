Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I'll see if he bites, and if not, we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm offering $190. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, this is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still a good profit for me.  It's also better than selling to John for $150. I'm willing to take the deal to avoid further negotiation."
