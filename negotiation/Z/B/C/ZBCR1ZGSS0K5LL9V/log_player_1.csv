Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your operations.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the significant value you'll realize. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I want to see if I can close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still not quite at my minimum. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial goal.  I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  It's very close, but I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I'd like to try to reach an agreement with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to see if we can bridge the gap a bit more. If the next round doesn't go well, I'll start considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $925,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal! I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. John's offer guarantees me at least $800,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting nothing."
