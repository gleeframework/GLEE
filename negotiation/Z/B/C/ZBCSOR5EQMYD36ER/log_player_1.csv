"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm not afraid to lose this deal entirely if Bob's counteroffer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I am going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate with Bob. My goal is to secure a price closer to $1,500,000, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to get there. If Bob continues to be unwilling to negotiate, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to try to pressure Bob with a lower counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is significantly lower than my previous offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm trying to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway. I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I can afford to take a bit more risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical moment. Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now very close to his perceived value of $1,000,000.  There is a high likelihood that he won't budge much further.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a significant risk of ending up with a price below my minimum acceptable value. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. I am prioritizing a guaranteed outcome over the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob."
