Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay closer to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low. It's still better than selling to John, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a profit for me. It's a signal that I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my desired value."
