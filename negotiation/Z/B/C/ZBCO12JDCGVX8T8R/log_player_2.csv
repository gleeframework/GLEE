"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, Bob can potentially get it for even cheaper. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can leverage the knowledge of Alice's minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between Alice's offer and his ideal price. By offering $12,500, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to his limit. This counteroffer also provides a starting point for further negotiation and leaves room for potential concessions in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and has several rounds left to try and push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money and is pushing for a price closer to his limit. By offering $13,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential concessions in future rounds. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about acquiring the product but is also committed to achieving a price that works for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference again. How about $13,125?  I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer twice and counteroffered twice.  Alice's offers are still above Bob's limit, and the negotiating process seems to be getting repetitive.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will not lead to a price that Bob finds acceptable. Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum limit of $12,000, it's more efficient and beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John. This decision saves Bob time and ensures that he gets the product at the best possible price for him."
