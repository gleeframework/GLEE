Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **Above your minimum:**  It's $3000 higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** It's still likely to be within a range that Bob might consider if he values the product highly. 
* **Sets the tone:**  This offer signals that you believe the product is valuable and you are not desperate to sell it. 

**Remember:**  You can adjust this offer based on how Bob reacts and how much information you gather about his interest level."
