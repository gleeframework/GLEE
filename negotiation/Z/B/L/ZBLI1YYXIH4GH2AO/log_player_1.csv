"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll reject it and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value while still being reasonable for Bob, considering his initial offer. I'm also trying to be flexible and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.  I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $82.50. This is a fair price, considering my minimum and your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value but still showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $78? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $78 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value and a fair compromise. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating and potentially lose the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and is a decent outcome."
