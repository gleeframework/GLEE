"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $130 is too high for Bob. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $107.50?  That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's also important to remember that Bob has the option of buying from John for $80.  The pressure is on Alice to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $107.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 96.25} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet halfway again. I'm offering the product for $101.87.  This is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his target price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. Additionally, Bob has the safety net of buying from John for $80, so he has the leverage to continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $101.87 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $96.25.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 96.25} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's try to bridge the gap a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $99.06. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.06. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99.06
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $99.06 is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above what he's willing to pay.  With only 3 rounds left, Bob has to consider the potential for further negotiation. 

* **Risk of Continuing:** If Bob rejects the offer and continues, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. She might even raise her price again. 
* **Safety of John's Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is lower than Alice's current offer. 

Given the limited rounds and the risk of Alice not lowering her price further, it's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John at the guaranteed $80 price.  He's still saving money compared to Alice's offer."
