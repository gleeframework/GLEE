"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a fair price, it's slightly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $10,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
