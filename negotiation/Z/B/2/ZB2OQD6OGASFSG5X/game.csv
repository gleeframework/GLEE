"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  If that doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to compromise at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at $9,000, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
