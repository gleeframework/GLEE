Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the product's value to Bob, I aim to justify the higher price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, setting the price too high might discourage Bob completely.  A softer approach could involve offering a smaller ""discount"" initially."
