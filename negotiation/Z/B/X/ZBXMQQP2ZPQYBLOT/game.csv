,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if this works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
