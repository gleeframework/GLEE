{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, even if it's just a slight price reduction.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but still attractive compared to your guaranteed sale price of $15,000. This gives Bob the perception of getting a ""deal"" while maximizing your potential profit."
