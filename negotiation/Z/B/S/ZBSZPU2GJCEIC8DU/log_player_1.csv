Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm confident that if Bob rejects, I can still get a good price from him or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000.  This is still above Bob's offer but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  I believe this is a reasonable price, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low.  I'm no longer confident that I can get a better price from him, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum value.  It's time to secure the deal with John and guarantee a fair price."
