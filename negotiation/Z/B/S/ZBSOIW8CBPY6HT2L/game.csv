"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems promising, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is a fair price given its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,300,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is far greater, especially considering its potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but $1,550,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident that this product will bring you far more value in the long run. Let's settle this at $1,475,000.  This is my final offer.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your finality, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to push my budget a little further, but this is truly my final offer.  Let's close this deal at $1,450,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
