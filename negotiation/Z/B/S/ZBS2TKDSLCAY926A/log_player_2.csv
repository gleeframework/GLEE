"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! After considering your interest and the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much profit as possible above her valuation of $800,000.
* **Your Incentive:** You want to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to John's offer of $1,200,000 to keep some negotiating room.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might be willing to come down closer to her minimum acceptable price to avoid losing the sale."
