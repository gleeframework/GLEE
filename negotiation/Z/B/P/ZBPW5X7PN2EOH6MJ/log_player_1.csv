**Reasoning:**

Bob is not moving significantly towards our desired price point.  He dropped his offer considerably from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000, indicating he might be unwilling to go much higher.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to $1,850,000 within the remaining rounds. 

Selling to John at $1,500,000 is the safest option at this point, guaranteeing a good profit and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
