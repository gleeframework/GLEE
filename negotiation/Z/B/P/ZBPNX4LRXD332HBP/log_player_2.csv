# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
