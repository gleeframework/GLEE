# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget of $150. I'm willing to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $120?  I'm very interested in the product and think we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  That's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still within my budget and is a good deal compared to buying from John for $150. I'm happy to accept this offer."
