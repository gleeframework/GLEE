{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. This shows I'm willing to compromise to some extent.

This strategy allows me to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also being open to a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's tempting to take $9,500, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:**  Although John is offering $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob first. Negotiation can potentially lead to a better outcome, although there's always the risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, leaving me with only John's option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal,  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you!  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the low offer:**  I'm firm in rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm keeping the conversation open and friendly.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to make my offer seem even more attractive. 
* **Open for further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for more negotiation, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,800. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired earnings and my initial offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range before accepting his offer.
* **John's offer is still a strong backup:**  While John's offer is very appealing, I'm not willing to give up on getting a better price from Bob just yet. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm aiming to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a more favorable outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,500.  This price acknowledges your need for a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to settle on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but showing I'm still willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Compromising further:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, showing my willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing a win-win:**  I'm highlighting that the proposed price is beneficial for both of us - it gives Bob a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
* **Final offer approach:** I'm suggesting this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've decided to take a closer look at other options. I can get the product from John for $10,000, so I'm willing to meet you at that price. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.** While I'd prefer more, $10,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go, given my own minimum value of $15,000.
* **John's offer is significantly better.**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is a much more favorable outcome for me.
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price. 

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure the higher price."
