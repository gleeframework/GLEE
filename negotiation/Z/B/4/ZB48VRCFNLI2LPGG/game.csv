"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal,  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you!  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,500.  This price acknowledges your need for a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to settle on this final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
