Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I need to make as much as possible, and this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I've made the offer reasonable, considering what I know about Bob's valuation. This helps establish a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I've left the door open for Bob to counter, recognizing that this is a negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I can always walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While I understand Bob's perspective, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy.**  Instead of settling for a price that's significantly below my minimum, it's worth exploring if I can negotiate a more favorable price with Bob. 
* **John provides a safety net.**  I know John is ready to buy at $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's low offer. I have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This price still gives you a good value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob. By saying it's still a good deal for him, I'm reminding him of the benefit he'll get from acquiring it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've made the counteroffer slightly above my ""floor,"" allowing for a little more wiggle room in case Bob is willing to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and am confident that I can walk away if Bob doesn't come up to a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This price seems more reasonable to me, considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss.
* **John's offer guarantees my desired outcome.**  Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I achieve my minimum goal and get the best possible price for the product. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Negotiating with Bob further is likely to be time-consuming and may not result in a better outcome. 

It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. I should prioritize securing the best possible deal rather than engaging in protracted negotiations that might not yield a better result."
