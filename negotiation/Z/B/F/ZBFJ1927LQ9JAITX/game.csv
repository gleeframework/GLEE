"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This price still gives you a good value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This price seems more reasonable to me, considering the value the product holds for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
