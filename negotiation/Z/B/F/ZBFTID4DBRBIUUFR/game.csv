"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000.

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
