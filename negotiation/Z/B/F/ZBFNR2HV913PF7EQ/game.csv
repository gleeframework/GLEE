"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair price considering its value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000.  This is my final offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
