"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is above his budget and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no need to accept a higher price when a lower price is available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he has the option of getting the product from John for a better price. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice as he's already found a seller who meets his price requirements."
