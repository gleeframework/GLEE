"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to get a valuable product at a competitive price.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being flexible and coming up in your offer.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a price that I think is reasonable for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.  If you're still not willing to go higher, I might have to take John's offer.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
