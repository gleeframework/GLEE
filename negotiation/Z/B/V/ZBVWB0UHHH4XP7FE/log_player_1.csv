"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum threshold, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to get a valuable product at a competitive price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to sell for that price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price in the next round.  However, I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John.  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I might just take John's $10,000 offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being flexible and coming up in your offer.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a price that I think is reasonable for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.  If you're still not willing to go higher, I might have to take John's offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
