Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe we can reach a fair deal. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is too low for me right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to counter with $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $10,500 is a decent deal, and we're getting closer to a final agreement. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
