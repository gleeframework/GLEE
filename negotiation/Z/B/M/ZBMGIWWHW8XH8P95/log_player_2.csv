"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm confident it's an investment that will pay for itself quickly. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what John is selling for, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price.  It's likely Alice is willing to go lower than $1,400,000 since she values the product at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it's a price that allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000.  This price is still within Bob's budget and represents a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price through further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
