"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
