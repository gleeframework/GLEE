I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I hope this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, while also demonstrating the value of the product."

Bob hasn't budged from his $12,000 offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and better than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
