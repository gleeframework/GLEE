Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $8,000 floor price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $12,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling and you're confident in the value of your product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's a chance he's willing to go higher, especially since he values the product at $12,000. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit below that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my ideal price of $10,000. It's likely that we won't get a better offer from Bob, and it's still a good deal for me. I'll accept his offer."
