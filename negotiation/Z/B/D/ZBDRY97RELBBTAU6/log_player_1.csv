Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers waiting."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) and your minimum ($15,000) allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, framing the offer as ""exclusive"" and highlighting ""unique value"" subtly justifies the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You know you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $15,000."
