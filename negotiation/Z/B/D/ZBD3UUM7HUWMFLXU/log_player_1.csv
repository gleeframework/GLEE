Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Value proposition:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob might make him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation, indicating flexibility.

**Next steps:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counter-offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can only agree to a price of $9500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than my minimum:** Bob's offer is above my minimum price of $8,000.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a better price than $9,500. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, keeping the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price.

**Next steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than $10,000, aiming to secure a price closer to that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  $9,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This reflects the high quality and potential of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining negotiation leverage:** By counter-offering instead of accepting, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and am still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reasonable counter:**  $9,750 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while keeping the price closer to my desired amount.
* **Emphasizing product value:**  Reiterating the product's value and potential in the message reinforces my position and might sway Bob.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we have a deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $9500 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob is firm on $9,500, and further counteroffers may risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Close to desired price:** $9,500 is only slightly below my desired price and is still a profitable sale for me.
* **Time and risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the sale to John.

**Next steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and move on."
