{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I believe it's worth a great deal to the right buyer.  I'm starting the offer at $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $20,000 to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a good price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without giving away too much information.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum. 

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $17,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm counteroffering at $17,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also value the product.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to further negotiation."
