"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a new price of $9,200 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm proposing a new price of $9,400 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to switch tactics. Alice seems firm at $9,400, and further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Buying from John at $10,000, while not ideal, prevents further potential losses in this negotiation and guarantees you get the product."
