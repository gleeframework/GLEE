"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $13000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price that I can reasonably consider.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. While $13000 is a bit out of my budget, I'm willing to consider $13500 as a compromise. This would allow us to reach an agreement while staying close to my desired price point.",13500.0,Bob,4,
