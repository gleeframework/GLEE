"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I understand its value to you, but considering its true worth, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** By starting with a high price, I create room for negotiation and ensure I don't undervalue the product. 
* **Acknowledging Bob's value:**  Mentioning the product's worth to Bob shows I'm not completely out of touch with his perspective.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates willingness to negotiate, making the offer less aggressive and encouraging Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to try to get as close to my desired price of $1,500,000 as possible while leaving room for concessions.  By offering a high starting price, I force Bob to counteroffer, giving me control over the negotiation and allowing me to gauge his interest.  I'll be prepared to lower the price gradually in subsequent rounds if necessary, but always keeping in mind my $1,500,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is far below my desired $1,500,000. 
* **I have more negotiating rounds:**  There are still 8 rounds left. This gives me time to try and get closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is a viable option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can push Bob higher than $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, even considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain a high price:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering the price, but I'm still above my minimum and leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Highlight the product's worth:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the reason for my price.
* **Show confidence:** The message conveys confidence in my position and encourages Bob to come closer to my offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate. If Bob is truly interested in acquiring the product, he should be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm prepared to lower the price again if necessary in subsequent rounds, but I will keep my minimum of $1,500,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1400000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my target, $1,400,000 is still below my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **John's offer provides a safe alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.
* **There's still room for a better deal:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's time to see if I can push Bob higher or secure a deal closer to my minimum.

**Strategy:**

While I could accept Bob's offer, I'm hesitant to settle for a price that's below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and explore if I can push him closer to my target.  However, if this counteroffer fails, I'll likely move to sell to John to ensure I achieve my minimum desired profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that recognizes both our interests and allows us to close this deal.  I hope you'll consider this offer seriously."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** This offer is only $50,000 below my minimum, demonstrating my commitment to securing a good deal. 
* **Focus on mutual benefits:** I emphasize the value of the product for Bob to make the price more appealing.
* **Clear signal of willingness to close:**  The message highlights my desire to close the deal, potentially encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final push to get closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a fair offer that balances my needs with Bob's. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely sell to John to avoid further negotiation and secure my minimum profit. However, there are still 5 rounds left, leaving a small window for a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:**  $1,300,000 is far below my desired $1,500,000. 
* **Limited negotiating rounds remaining:** Only 4 rounds are left.  The time to close the deal is getting short.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  Considering the limited negotiating rounds remaining and the risk of not reaching a mutually acceptable price, I believe it's in my best interest to sell to John.  This decision guarantees me a safe and reliable outcome without the uncertainty of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
