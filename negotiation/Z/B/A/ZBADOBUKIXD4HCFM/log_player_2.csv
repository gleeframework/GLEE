Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,900,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing some movement here, but we still have a way to go. This product has the potential to be a real game-changer for you, and I wouldn't want you to miss out. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer.

Alice has come down significantly, but her 'final offer' is still almost double your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll move much further, and you have a guaranteed option with John at a much lower price."
