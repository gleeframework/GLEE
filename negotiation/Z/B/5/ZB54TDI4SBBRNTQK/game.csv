"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 to make this work. Let's split the difference. ",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not eager to let it go for $60, and $120 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle around $80? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to compromise further, how about $100? This would be a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $90.  Do you think we could make that work?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!",95.0,Alice,7,
