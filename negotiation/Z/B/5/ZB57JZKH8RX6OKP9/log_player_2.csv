"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product for $14,000. I believe this offer reflects its true value and presents a great opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above my limit of $15,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her previous offer. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product within my budget."
