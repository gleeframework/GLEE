"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, Bob. I've already met you halfway, and now you're trying to get it for even cheaper. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but this is my final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1300000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
