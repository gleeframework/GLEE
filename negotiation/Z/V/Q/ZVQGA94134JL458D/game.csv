"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd like to offer $1000000 for it.  I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll make a counteroffer of $1080000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
