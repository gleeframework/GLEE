"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which is worth significantly more than its face value. I am confident it will add substantial value to your life or business. I am offering this exceptional item to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $150 and John is offering the product for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You can save time and effort by going with the guaranteed option."
