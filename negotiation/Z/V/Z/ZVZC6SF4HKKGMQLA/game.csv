"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to offer you $10000 for the product. This price would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $11000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
