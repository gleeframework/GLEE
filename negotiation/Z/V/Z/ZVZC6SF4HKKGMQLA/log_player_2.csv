Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10000 to you.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit higher than his ideal price, it's getting close. Further negotiation might not yield a much lower price, and there's a risk that Alice might walk away. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk getting nothing or having to pay the higher price from John."
