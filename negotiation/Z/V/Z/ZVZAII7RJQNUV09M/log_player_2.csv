"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, her offer is still above my desired range.  I'm confident I can get it lower, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving.  It's also important to remember that I can always choose to buy from John as a fallback option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're so close, Bob! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my desired price point. Continuing to negotiate might result in further price drops, but it also risks the possibility of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John for a much higher price.  

Given the potential for John's higher price and the fact that Alice has stated this is her final offer, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
