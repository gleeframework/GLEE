"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping to get closer to the true value of the product to you. Considering your initial offer was $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000.

"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair return on your investment. However, I'm still hoping to secure a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and a good balance between our desired price points. ",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Considering your last offer was $950,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This price reflects the product's true value to you and still provides a reasonable profit margin for me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm glad we're so close, Bob! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000.
