"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find incredibly valuable.  It's worth at least $10000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $11000.  This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to maximize the value of this unique product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,1,
