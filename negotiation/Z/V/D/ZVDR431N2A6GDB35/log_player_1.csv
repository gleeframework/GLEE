Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. My offer is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $1,200,000 is a strong opening price, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,200,000 is a good price for me, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value, allowing for a potential counteroffer.
* **Protecting my minimum:** This offer is well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring a decent profit even if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** While $1,000,000 is my minimum, it's still less than what I believe the product is worth. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a better price in the next round of negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's interest:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows he's genuinely interested in the product. This gives me confidence that I can potentially secure a higher price.
* **No immediate need for money:**  There's no indication that I'm under pressure to sell immediately, allowing me to hold out for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point. However,  $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Strong Justification:** The message highlights the product's value and positions my counteroffer as a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $1,100,000 still provides a significant profit and is a good starting point for the next round of negotiation.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000 at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  While $1,050,000 isn't ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away entirely.  It's also possible that I might not be able to get a better offer in the next round.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation is a gamble, and it could potentially lead to a prolonged process. Selling to Bob now ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
