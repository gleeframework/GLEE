{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price point, but I'm leaving the door open for negotiation to see if I can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would still give me a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price considering your profit margin and the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close enough to my minimum price of $100. I'm willing to accept it, as it's better than selling to John for $100."
