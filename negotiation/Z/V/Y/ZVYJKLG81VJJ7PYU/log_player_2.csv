"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that allows for a significant return on your investment.  Let's discuss a price of $1,150,000.  This represents a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your $1,200,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. You know Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so she's aiming for a profit. By rejecting this offer, you encourage her to potentially come down to a price closer to her desired minimum."
