"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to giving up, Bob! I'm not willing to go any lower than $165. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best I can do. If you're still interested, I'll sell the product to you for $165. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",165.0,Alice,9,
