"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its potential for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair and reflects the product's worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,
