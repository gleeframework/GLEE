"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price of $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we discuss a price of $1,200,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to get closer to my target",1200000.0,Alice,5,
