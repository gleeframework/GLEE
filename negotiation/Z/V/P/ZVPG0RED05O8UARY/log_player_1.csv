Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than your fallback option (selling to John).
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is valid, briefly mentioning the ""value and potential"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product at a higher level, justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage even if he finds the initial price high.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You might need to lower your price, but always aim to stay above your $12,000 minimum."
