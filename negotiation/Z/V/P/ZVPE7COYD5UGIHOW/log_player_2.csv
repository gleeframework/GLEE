"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your desired price range.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your target price, it's still within your negotiation range. You can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is coming down in price, $925,000 is still above your target price range. There is still room for negotiation, and you should try to get a lower price. You're still significantly below the price John is offering, so there's no reason to buy from him yet."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price:** $915,000 is within your desired range, especially considering the potential of further negotiation rounds.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high:**  Alice is getting increasingly firm with her offers.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Alice backing out entirely.
* **John's offer is still significantly higher:**  $1,200,000 is far above your ideal price, making Alice's offer a much better value.

While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will budge much more.  Accepting this offer secures a decent price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or a higher price from John."
