"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I have some bargaining power.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible while still enticing Bob to make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that's less than what the product is worth to me. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $15,000, which is my minimum value and a compromise from my previous offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that it's a fair price for both of us. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a strong position for me, as it's my floor price. I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between $12,000 and $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price. However, I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which is my minimum. I'll keep this option in mind as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but still a bit lower than what I need.  Let's meet at $14,250.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising my price slightly to $14,250. This is a smaller increment compared to the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and pushing for a quick closure.
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. I'm willing to pay $13,750 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  Given the limited rounds remaining, and the fact that I can sell the product to John for my minimum price, I'm choosing to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with a lower price or running out of rounds."
