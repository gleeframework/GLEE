"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in seeing if a counteroffer will get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to do $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is flexible. $100 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for 110. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but I'm also trying to be reasonable.  $105 is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a deal for 108. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. $108 is within my budget and a good deal considering the product's value. It's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to counteroffer. I'm happy to accept this offer and move on."
