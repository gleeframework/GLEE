Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not going any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $105 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $150."
