Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000. It's still within your budget, so accepting her offer is the best choice."
