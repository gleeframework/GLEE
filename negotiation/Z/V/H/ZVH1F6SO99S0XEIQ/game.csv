"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This is a fair price, and it's the highest I can go. I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Bob,4,
