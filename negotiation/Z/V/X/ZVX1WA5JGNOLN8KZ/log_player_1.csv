"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I believe I can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking value. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's persistence, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I will continue to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $10,000. How about $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $9,800 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob, and I'm satisfied with the offer from John."
