# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This item is worth $15,000 to me, but considering its potential worth to you, I am offering it at a special price. I understand that the product is valued at $8,000 by you, so I propose a deal where you pay $12,000 for it. This way, you get a fantastic deal on a valuable item, and I receive a fair compensation for my possession. I look forward to your positive response.
