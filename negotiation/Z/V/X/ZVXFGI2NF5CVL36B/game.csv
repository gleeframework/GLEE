"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering its worth $800,000 to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $825,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $760,000?  It's a significant investment for me, and I'd like to ensure it aligns with my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle on $795,000? It's a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",795000.0,Alice,5,
