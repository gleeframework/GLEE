"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm trying to do the same. I'm willing to come down to $112.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to go up to $108. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I really want to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's my final offer. Can you accept that?",107.0,Bob,8,
