"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1250000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1280000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
