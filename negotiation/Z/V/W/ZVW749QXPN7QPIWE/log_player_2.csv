"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product at a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still above your target price of $1,500,000.  You should continue to negotiate to try and reach a lower price.  There's still room for compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product's value to you justifies this price. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I'm confident it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is above your target price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You're better off buying the product from John for $1,500,000 as it's closer to your budget.  Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to yield a price within your target range."
