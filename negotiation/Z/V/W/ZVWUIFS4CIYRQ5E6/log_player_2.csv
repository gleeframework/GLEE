"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer  ($70) gives us more room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $100 alternative. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  The message aims to be respectful and suggests a willingness to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can do $82.50 for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved closer to our desired price range, but $82.50 is still above her value. We can likely negotiate further.
* **John as Leverage:**  We haven't used the option of buying from John as leverage yet.  

We'll continue negotiating, pushing for a price closer to $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's counteroffer.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The tone suggests we're getting closer to our limit but are still open to a deal. 
* **John in the Background:** While we don't explicitly mention John, the knowledge that we have an alternative option gives us a stronger position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $85 for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving slowly, and we're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing.
* **Time as a Factor:**  With each passing round, the potential savings diminish, making John's offer relatively more attractive.

We need to signal that we're serious about our price limit and may walk away soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have a hard limit on what I can spend. If you're able to do $78, we have a deal. Otherwise, I need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimatum:**  We're making it clear that this is our final offer with Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:** We explicitly mention considering ""other options,"" implying we're serious about John.
* **Slight Increase:**  We're nudging our offer up slightly to show flexibility but holding firm at a price well below John's. 

This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she'd rather make a deal now or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $78, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and my previous offer of $85, so I can offer you $81.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $81.50 is a reasonable compromise. We're saving $18.50 compared to John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings and risks pushing Alice away.
* **Time Value:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures a decent deal and avoids potentially missing out altogether."
