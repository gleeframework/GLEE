"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item for a great price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $10,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a profit. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's make a deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
