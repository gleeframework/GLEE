Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). Starting with a higher offer ($13,500) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price closer to her desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the price without revealing Alice's true minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By expressing openness to discussion, Alice appears flexible and encourages Bob to engage, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that Alice is offering it to Bob before a public listing implies she has other options if Bob declines. This creates a subtle sense of urgency.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. 
* Bob might outright reject the offer without counter-offering, leading Alice to John (her backup buyer) anyway. 
* A more aggressive starting price could alienate Bob and hinder potential negotiation."
