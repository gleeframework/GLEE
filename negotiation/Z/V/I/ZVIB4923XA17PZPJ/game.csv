"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and offering your perspective on the price.  I understand your initial offer, however, the value of this product to your operations is significant. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of what you're getting.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To be frank, anything above $700,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  How about we meet in the middle at that price?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about finding a middle ground.  Let's settle on $825,000.  This offer reflects my understanding of your budget constraints while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion. While your offer is getting closer, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
