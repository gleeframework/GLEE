Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I understand your initial offer, however, the value of this product to your operations is significant. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To be frank, anything above $700,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  How about we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion. While your offer is getting closer, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 before we run out of rounds. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John now."
