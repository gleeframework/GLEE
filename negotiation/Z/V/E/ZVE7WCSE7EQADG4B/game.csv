"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 was too low, Alice. How about we try $70? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would really help me out.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $70 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $85. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be totally transparent, $80 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
