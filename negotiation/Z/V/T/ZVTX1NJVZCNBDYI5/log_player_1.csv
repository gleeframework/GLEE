Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere desire to reach an agreement.  I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the true value of the product for both of us.

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still far below my minimum. It's time to push him harder to see how serious he is."

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to bridge the gap. However, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a price closer to my previous offer.  To move us forward, I'm proposing $1,800,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and I believe it represents a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob is finally at $1,000,000, but that's still far too low. I'll make one more strong counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to $1,300,000. If he's not willing to budge significantly, I'll take John's offer."

Round 8

Bob's final offer is too low, and it doesn't seem likely he'll go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
