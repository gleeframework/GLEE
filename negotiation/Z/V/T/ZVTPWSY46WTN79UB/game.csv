"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $108 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $103, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?",103.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $103 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $106. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",106.0,Alice,5,
