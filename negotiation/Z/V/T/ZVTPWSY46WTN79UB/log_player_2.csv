"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $100 to you, and you have the option of buying it from John for that price, you should reject Alice's offer. You can try to get a better price from Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum price. You can try to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $108 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $103, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $103 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $106. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $106 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $100 and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
