Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close! I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I want to see you get it.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,250?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price of $12,250 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice pulling out of the deal altogether, leaving you to buy from John at the higher price."
