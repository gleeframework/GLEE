"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save a bit of money. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's meet in the middle!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. How about $107.50? Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $107.50 is just a little too low for me.  How about $112.50?  That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",109.0,Bob,6,
