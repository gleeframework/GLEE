"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Bob's maximum value. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still slightly above it. There's room for further negotiation, and potentially reaching a price that's more favorable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This counteroffer continues the negotiation, gradually increasing Bob's offer. It's still below Alice's latest offer but closer to his maximum value, signaling his willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, but it's still above it. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price. It's wiser for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets it within his budget."
