"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
