Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards while still remaining well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This ensures you won't be forced to go below that price with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation, giving you the best chance to maximize your profit."
