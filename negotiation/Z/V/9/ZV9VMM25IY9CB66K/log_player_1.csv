"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $150 to me. I'm hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation, and hopefully Bob will counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to come up a bit from his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $150 and I'm getting closer to my goal.  It's also a risk to keep negotiating as there are only 6 rounds left, and I could end up selling to John for less."
