"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking to get at least $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
