# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $95. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you and won't be available to others. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a valuable item at a fantastic discount! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product and her offer is still above your maximum budget. You can do better by rejecting and seeing if she counters with a lower price or going with John."
