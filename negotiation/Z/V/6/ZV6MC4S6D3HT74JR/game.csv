"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,750,000 price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,650,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's work together to find a solution.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
