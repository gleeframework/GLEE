"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($600,000 vs. $800,000). This suggests she's willing to negotiate further. It's too early to buy from John, as we can likely get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you at $720,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $720,000, which is closer to my ideal price. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push her further down to a price closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $720,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to pay $710,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the potential value it brings to me.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $710,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you at $725,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again to $725,000. This is only $5,000 away from my last counteroffer of $710,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Alice will become more stubborn and refuse to budge.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of a deal falling through."
