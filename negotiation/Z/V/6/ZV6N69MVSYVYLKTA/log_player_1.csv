Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
