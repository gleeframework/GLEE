Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $8,200? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $8,200. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit more before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $8,600.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to come up to this amount."", ""product_price"": 8600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,400? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $8,400 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,400 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise and settle at $8,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen! "", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,300? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  However, I only have two rounds left, and I'm worried that Bob won't budge much further.  It's better to guarantee the $10,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
