Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures that Bob sees value in the deal.  I'm confident that I can achieve a higher price, but I want to start strong and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, while still staying closer to my target price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $950,000, $920,000 is still a good price and significantly higher than John's offer.  It's important to recognize that further negotiation might not yield a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
