"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $925000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $962500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",962500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $962500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer now, so I'll counter with $925000 again. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $950000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $925000. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,10,
