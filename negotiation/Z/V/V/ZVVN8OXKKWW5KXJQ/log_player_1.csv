Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for your company.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be mindful of our company's budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I want to see if I can push Bob higher, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budgetary constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below where I need to be to make this worthwhile.  To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me to achieve my goals while offering you a significant value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a higher price. However, if the next few rounds don't yield a better offer, I'll be more open to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 just isn't enough for me to move forward.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the immense value this product offers. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a little."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below what I consider a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better offer from Bob. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, so I'll be more open to selling to John if the next few rounds don't yield a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing dialogue, but I need to be realistic.  $1,075,000 just doesn't meet my needs.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution. To demonstrate this, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a price point that fairly reflects the value this product provides.  I'm confident that with this offer, we can close a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** We're at a stalemate. Bob has not budged from his offer of $1,075,000, and I'm not willing to go lower.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a higher offer from Bob is too high.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I meet my minimum threshold and avoid the potential of getting nothing at all."
