"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate and leaves me in a good starting position.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  It's possible Bob is willing to pay more, and I want to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. It's possible I can convince Bob to come closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,350,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, and this price is still considerably higher than his last offer. By showing flexibility, I hope to encourage Bob to come up with a better price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower and I'm not confident I can get a price I'm happy with.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
