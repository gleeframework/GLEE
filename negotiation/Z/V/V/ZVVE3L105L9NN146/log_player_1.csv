Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested, bringing you closer to your maximum possible profit.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000.  While he might try to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll accept a price this high. 
* **Psychology:** By framing it as a ""great deal,"" you might encourage Bob to consider it more seriously even though the price is high. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, you can always sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
