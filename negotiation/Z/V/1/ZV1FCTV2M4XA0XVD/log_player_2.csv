# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is now offering $8,500, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and the ""additional perks"" are likely not worth the extra $500.  John is offering a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best option for Bob."
