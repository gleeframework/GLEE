"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe is of great value to you. I'm asking for $900,000.  It's a fair price given its worth to you, and it gives us both room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and it allows for a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below what I need to accept. Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still allows for a significant margin for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price is fair considering the value of the product to me, and it's a win-win situation.  Let's reach a final agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
