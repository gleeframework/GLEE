"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is closer, but still undervalues what I can offer elsewhere.  My final offer is $1,250,000.  This is my absolute bottom line.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
