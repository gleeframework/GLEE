Alice's offer is way too high.  It's in my best interest to counteroffer and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. I'll counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is closer, but still undervalues what I can offer elsewhere.  My final offer is $1,250,000.  This is my absolute bottom line.

Alice's final offer is still above my budget. While I'd love to get this product from Alice, it's more financially responsible for me to buy it from John for $800,000."
