"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $105 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,92.0,Bob,4,
