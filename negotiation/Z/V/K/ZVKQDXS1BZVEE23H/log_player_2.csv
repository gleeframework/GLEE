It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for me. It's within my budget, and better than what John is offering.  I'll accept and close the deal."
