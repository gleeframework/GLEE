"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get this a bit lower. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum value. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating while also leaving room for compromise.  The message is friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above Bob's minimum value of $8,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a price that's within his budget and saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
