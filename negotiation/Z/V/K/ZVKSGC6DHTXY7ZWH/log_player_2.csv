Alice's offer:

This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I think you'll really appreciate its worth. What do you think?

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but the risk of Alice not budging further outweighs the potential reward.  It's time to cut losses and buy from John."
