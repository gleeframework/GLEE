"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I think you'll really appreciate its worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
