"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, it's valued at $100 by many. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I am extending this opportunity to you at the same value. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is flattering, it doesn't change the fact that she's offering the product at her own perceived value of $100.  You know you can get the product for the same price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially offer a lower price, letting you achieve your goal of saving money."
