"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm only offering this price to you because I believe in the potential of our partnership.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
