"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can do better by either counter-offering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to your target price, you can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You're not that far from your ideal price point with John, so there's room for further negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for at $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is closer to my minimum price. Can we agree on that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,250 is a good price, it's still above your ideal target. At this point, it's better to stick to your commitment and buy from John for $8,000. You've reached a point where the negotiation isn't likely to go any lower."
