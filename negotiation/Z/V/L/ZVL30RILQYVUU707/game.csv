"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about $140? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",130.0,Bob,4,
