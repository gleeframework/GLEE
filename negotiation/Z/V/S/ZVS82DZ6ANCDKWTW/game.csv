"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This way we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still below what I need to get. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $97.50. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",97.5,Bob,6,
