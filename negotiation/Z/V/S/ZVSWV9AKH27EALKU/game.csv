"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm thinking of a price of $1800000 for this exceptional item. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $1800000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still within my budget constraints and cannot meet the $1700000 price point. I would like to offer $1600000 as my final counteroffer. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're seeking.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1650000. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet the $1650000 price point. I would like to make one last counteroffer at $1600000. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
