Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you even greater returns.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still early in the negotiation. While $1,080,000 is a good profit, there's room to push for a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this right now. How about $1,090,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our acceptable range. Offering a price slightly above his last offer might encourage him to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, and I'll also offer to pay the full price within 30 days instead of the usual 60 days. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is strong. Getting paid in 30 days instead of 60 days is a valuable benefit that offsets the slightly lower price point. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
