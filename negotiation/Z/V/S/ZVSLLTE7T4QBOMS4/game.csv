"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal. How about $1,100,000?  This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,120,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
