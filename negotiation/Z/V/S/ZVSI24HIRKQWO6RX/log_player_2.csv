"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you'd love! I'm starting at $120, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $80."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. I want to see how Alice responds and if she's willing to come down on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now matching John's price, which is the best I can hope for. There's no point in further negotiation or going to John."
