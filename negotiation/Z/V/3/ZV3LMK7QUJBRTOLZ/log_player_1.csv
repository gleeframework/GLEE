Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a reasonable price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I saw it for from another seller. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price right now. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $80 just isn't quite where I need to be. Would you consider $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over his initial offer, and it's getting close to my minimum.  Selling to John for $120 is tempting, but I'm also trying to build a relationship with Bob, and a successful negotiation can lead to future opportunities."
