"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $120. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.,115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I can't go as low as $115. My absolute lowest price for this product is $120.  Take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm really close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and my original offer of $120. How about we do $118?,118.0,Bob,6,
