{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",

I'm starting high to gauge your interest and leave room for negotiation.  While I have a backup buyer, I'd prefer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my valuation, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to push a little further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial ask while still acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving while striving for a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I think $125 is a more reasonable price for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly anchored around $120-125, and while I could push further, the difference is getting smaller. Accepting his offer at $125 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
