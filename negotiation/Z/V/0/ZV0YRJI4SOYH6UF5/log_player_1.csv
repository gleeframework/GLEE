Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $1,400,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000), giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have room to negotiate upwards, potentially reaching closer to his value.

This approach balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
