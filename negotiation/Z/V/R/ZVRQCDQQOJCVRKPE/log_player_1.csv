Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profits and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm still making a significant profit of $150,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob still gets a good deal and saves $50,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, we can potentially negotiate closer to a mutually beneficial price. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the chances of a successful deal while still securing a high profit."
