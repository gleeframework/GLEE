Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **Reasonable:** The price is not excessively high, leaving room for a potential compromise. 

By leaving room for negotiation, you can potentially reach a price closer to your desired amount while still making the sale."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for your product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now equal to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome. It also saves time and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely."
