"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too High:**  I'm not starting at my minimum value ($15,000) because that would likely lead to an immediate rejection.
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a reason for the price, framing it as a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **No Rush:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I can afford to reject this low offer and see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a specific reason for the counteroffer (""meet in the middle"").
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my previous offer.  This shows I'm flexible, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair price, considering I'm already paying more than what I would pay John. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $10,000 is still below my desired value. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe I can still push for a better price.  
* **No Time Pressure:** I have 6 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating.
* **John's Offer:** It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is a safety net if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a little below where I need to be, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** My offer is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, focusing on a fair profit for both.
* **Not Too Low:** I'm not going significantly below my minimum value, but I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the middle of the negotiation, so I need to start getting closer to a deal."
