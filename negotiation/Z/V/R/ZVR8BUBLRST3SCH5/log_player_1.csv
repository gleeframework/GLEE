Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price range in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
