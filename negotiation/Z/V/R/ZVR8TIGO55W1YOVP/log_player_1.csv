Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It's a good starting point, as it's still well above Bob's estimated value. 
* **Message:** I've framed the message to highlight the value for Bob while leaving room for negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he rejects, it tells me he's unlikely to accept anything close to my desired price, and I can move on to John.
* **Start the negotiation process:** If he counters, we can begin a back-and-forth, potentially finding a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's initial offer is too low. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By showing I'm not desperate for a sale, I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Explore better options:**  I can counter with a higher offer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. 
* **Preserve the possibility of selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I still have the option of selling to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, highlighting both the discount for Bob and the necessity for a reasonable profit for me.  

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find common ground:**  It bridges the gap between our initial positions, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I show that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still adjust my price slightly, but it gives me a stronger bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations.  

**Strategy:**

Selling to John at this point is the best option because:

* **Guaranteed profit:** John is willing to pay my desired price, ensuring I maximize my earnings.
* **Time savings:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely take more time and could potentially lead to further price reductions that would be unfavorable to me.
* **Avoidance of risk:** There's no guarantee that I can reach an agreement with Bob, and I risk losing out on a sure sale with John."
