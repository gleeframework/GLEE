"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of the product's true value and potential returns it can generate. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. I propose a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
