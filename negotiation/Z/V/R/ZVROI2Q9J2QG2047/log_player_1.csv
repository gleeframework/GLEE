{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering it for $100, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's $120 offer if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'll reject it. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target price of $120."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $105.  This product is in high demand and I'm confident it's worth that value. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is in high demand, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm still not satisfied. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can reach a price closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiations and ensure I get a price I'm happy with, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
