# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try negotiating with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:

While $95 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or buying from John."
