"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is going to start with his maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear boundary for the negotiation and forces Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still $2,000 higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price, and he has the option of buying from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $9,000, which is a compromise between his previous offer of $8,000 and Alice's offer of $10,000. This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but is still trying to keep the price as low as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting very close to Bob's target, there's still room for a better deal. Bob is willing to push for a lower price, especially since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $9,250. This is a small increase from his previous offer of $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price below $9,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,375 is still above Bob's target of $8,000.  With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation is likely to continue for a while longer, potentially leading to even lower offers. 

However, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the risk of not securing the product at a reasonable price within the remaining rounds. 

Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John, guaranteeing the product at his maximum budget."
