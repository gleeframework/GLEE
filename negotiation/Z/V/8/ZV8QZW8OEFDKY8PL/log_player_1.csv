"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating language:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Setting the stage for negotiation:**  By stating it's a ""great deal,"" I'm implicitly suggesting there's room for compromise. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping my floor price in mind.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still fall back to selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,400,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above his perceived value, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Avoiding John:** I want to explore all possibilities with Bob before resorting to selling to John, as I can potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? It's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer but staying above my minimum price.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Clear next step:** I'm offering a specific price point, making it clear what I expect from Bob in this round.

**Important Note:**  I'm still mindful of my minimum price and the option to sell to John.  However, I believe I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob with further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I think we can find a middle ground. How about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  I've reached a price that meets my needs, and there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. 
* **Secure deal:**  Accepting the offer ensures I get the minimum I'm willing to accept and closes the deal. 

While there's always the possibility of getting a higher price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially given the time constraint.  Selling to John at the same price would be a safe option, but it doesn't offer any potential for a better outcome."
