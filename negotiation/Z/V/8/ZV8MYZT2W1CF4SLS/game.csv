"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500 at this time.  Let me know if that's a possibility.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. My counteroffer is $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $9500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $9500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $14000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $14000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10500. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, $10500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",13500.0,Alice,7,
