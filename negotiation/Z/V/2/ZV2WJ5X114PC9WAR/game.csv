"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1350000 and $1250000, which is $1300000. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
