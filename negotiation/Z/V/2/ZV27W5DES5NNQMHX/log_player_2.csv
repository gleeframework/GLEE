"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious interest in the product while staying within his budget.  A $100 offer provides room for negotiation while still leaving some wiggle room for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to his $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on $120,  which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making his final offer, emphasizing his budget limitations and his willingness to close the deal if Alice accepts. This strategy puts pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to meet his price or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $140, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's $120 budget.  Since Bob is committed to getting the best deal, he should continue negotiating to try and reach his desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially push Alice even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $130. If you're willing to do that, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows he's still interested in the product but is firm on his budget.  This counteroffer might be enough to convince Alice to accept, especially since they're only $10 apart."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit away from $130, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $140 and $130, which would be $135. That's the best I can do. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $135 is still above Bob's desired price of $120. With only a few rounds left, the likelihood of getting Alice to go any lower is slim. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating, especially since Bob can now purchase the product from John for his maximum price of $120. It's strategically better for Bob to cut his losses and secure the product from John to avoid potential further negotiation deadlocks and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
