"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $850000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $850000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
