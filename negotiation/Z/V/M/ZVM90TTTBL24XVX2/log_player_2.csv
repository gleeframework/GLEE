"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My budget is $8,000 for this product. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's a lower price than the initial offer, Bob can still aim for a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000.  However, that's still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer of $9,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is my best and final offer in this range, but I'm willing to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for Bob, who is determined to stay within his $8,000 budget.  There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows me to stay within my spending limits.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  While there are only a few rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will come down significantly further.  Bob is better off buying from John at this point to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
