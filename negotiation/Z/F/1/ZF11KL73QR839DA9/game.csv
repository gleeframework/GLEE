"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing your interest. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this revised counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
