Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.
