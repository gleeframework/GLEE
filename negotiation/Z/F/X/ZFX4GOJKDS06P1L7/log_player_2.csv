"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $9200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and $9,200 is still above your target. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can meet you at $9000, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $9100? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still within your budget but can potentially get a better deal. You're close to your target price and it's worth attempting one more counteroffer to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9100 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8900, which would split the difference between our last offers. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from my target. I can meet you at $9000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make a final concession, so how about we meet at $9050? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While you could attempt another counteroffer, it seems unlikely Alice will budge further. Accepting her offer at $9,050 is still a good deal for you, as it's within your budget and saves you $950 compared to buying from John."
