"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $9200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $8800?  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can meet you at $9000, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $9100? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9100 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8900, which would split the difference between our last offers. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from my target. I can meet you at $9000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make a final concession, so how about we meet at $9050?",9050.0,Alice,7,
