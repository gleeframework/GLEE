Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue to negotiate, Alice has met him halfway and the price is now within Bob's budget and a good deal.  Going to John would cost Bob more."
