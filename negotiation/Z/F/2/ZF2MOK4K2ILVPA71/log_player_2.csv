Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,200, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not budging on that. I'm starting to think that we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one final offer: $7,200, and that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $7,200 and unwilling to budge.  While you could try another counteroffer, you're running the risk of her walking away entirely. At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is a better deal than risking a failed negotiation with Alice."
