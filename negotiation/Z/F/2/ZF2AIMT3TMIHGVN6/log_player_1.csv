Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

We're still a ways away from John's offer.  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, so there's room for continued negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my last offer of $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

It seems Bob is firm on his $750,000 offer.  Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John at this point."
