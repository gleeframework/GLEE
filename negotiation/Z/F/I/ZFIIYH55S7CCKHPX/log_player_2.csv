"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150. 
* It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $135 is closer to Bob's ideal price but still higher than his maximum budget.
* It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down closer to $125."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $132, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $132 is still within Bob's budget of $150. 
* It's only $2 higher than Bob's previous counteroffer of $130.
* Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
