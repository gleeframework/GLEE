"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's a significant difference between $120 and Bob's maximum price of $150, so it's worth exploring counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good compromise and falls within Bob's budget. It's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $120, and it's still a better deal than buying from John for $150.  There's a good chance Bob could continue negotiating and get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether with Alice increases.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice for Bob."
