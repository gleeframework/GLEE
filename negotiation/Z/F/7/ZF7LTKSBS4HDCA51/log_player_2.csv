"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $140.
* John is selling it for $150.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer. You can then buy the product from John for $150, which is your maximum price point."
