You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product and John is offering it for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. You'll save yourself time and effort by simply buying from John."
