"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. It's worth seeing if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'll try to meet her halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?"",
""product_price"": 107.50
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $110 as possible. While I could try to haggle further, $109 is a good price and it's not worth the risk of her backing out or the time to negotiate further."
