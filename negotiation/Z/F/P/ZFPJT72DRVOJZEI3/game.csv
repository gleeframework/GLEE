"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
