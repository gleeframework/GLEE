Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** The message explicitly invites Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm aware of John's offer of $100, which serves as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $100 from John, which provides a solid fallback option. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the deal's value for Bob, reminding him of the potential savings.
* **Fair Profit:** I'm justifying the price by mentioning the need for a fair profit, making the request more reasonable.
* **Open for Discussion:** The message ends with a question, keeping the door open for further negotiation.

This counteroffer is a calculated compromise that aims to reach an agreement while still maintaining a reasonable profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, which is significantly better than Bob's final offer.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I receive a price that aligns with my minimum requirement.  The negotiation with Bob has reached a point where it's no longer beneficial for me to continue."
