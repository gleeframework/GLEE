Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. She knows she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Psychology:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and showing a willingness to negotiate. This approach could encourage Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a sale above the minimum $15,000.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice makes a profit of $14,500, which is less than John's offer but still a significant gain.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  Bob might counter-offer with a price closer to his perceived value. Alice can then decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away knowing she has John's offer as a safety net.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells to John for the guaranteed $15,000, achieving her minimum acceptable profit."
