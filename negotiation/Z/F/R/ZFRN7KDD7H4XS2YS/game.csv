"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,050,000? That leaves some room for negotiation and ensures we both get a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and will allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
