"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $2,300,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true capabilities and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer takes into account the value it offers but also shows my willingness to find a compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still too far from what I have in mind. To be frank, I'm considering other options at this point. If you're able to come down to $1,200,000, I'm ready to make a deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to consider a significant price adjustment to close this deal today.  How about we settle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this done, but it's also my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we should try and find a solution here. Your final offer is closer, but still above my budget.  I can go up to $1,100,000. If that works, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I appreciate your time, but I'll need to go with a different option.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
