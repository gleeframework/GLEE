"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I'm aiming for a profit.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be motivated to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still gives me a profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not ready to accept that price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to drop my price again to $1,250,000. This is getting very close to my minimum, but I still want to see if Bob will come up a little. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John and walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is it. Bob's offer is too low.  I've been flexible, but I'm not going to give it away.  I'm going to sell to John and ensure I get a fair price."
