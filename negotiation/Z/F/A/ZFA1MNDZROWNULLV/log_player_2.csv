"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as other interested parties exist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your walk-away price ($1,200,000 from John). By rejecting her offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your backup option, saving you money."
