"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $1,250,000? This offer still gives you a significant advantage in value, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is still a little high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
