"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and I believe it holds immense value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, reflecting the significant benefit you'll gain from it. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually agreeable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's plenty of room to counteroffer and see if you can get closer to a price you're comfortable with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Openness:** The message ends by expressing a willingness to continue negotiating, showing a cooperative approach."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price acknowledges your value assessment while still allowing for a fair profit for me. Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd still like to see a bit more flexibility.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm still confident the product is worth more to you, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.  I'm going to counter with $1,275,000.  This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John for $1,500,000 is too high.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a favorable price."
