"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price acknowledges your value assessment while still allowing for a fair profit for me. Let's keep the conversation going.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd still like to see a bit more flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects a fair compromise and allows for a successful deal for both of us. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm still confident the product is worth more to you, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.  I'm going to counter with $1,275,000.  This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. Let's finalize this agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
