"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, and I believe it's important to establish a high baseline value for the product. I'm aware this might be rejected, but it's crucial to understand what Bob values the product at.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but this initial offer sets the stage for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I will reject his offer and move on to the next round. I believe there's still potential for a more mutually beneficial deal, and I'm prepared to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This represents a compromise from my initial offer, but it still ensures a profit for me and keeps the negotiation moving forward. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and the potential for Bob to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I would have preferred a higher price,  accepting this offer ensures I reach my goal of selling the product at a value that's worth it to me.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
