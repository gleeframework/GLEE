"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $11,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,000, which is $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",12250.0,Alice,5,
