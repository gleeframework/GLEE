"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?  I think that's a fair price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you can't go as low as $90, Alice.  How about $110? That's a pretty significant jump from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",130.0,Alice,5,
