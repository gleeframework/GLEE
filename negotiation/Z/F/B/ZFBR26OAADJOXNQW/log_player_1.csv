Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Not Too High:** While aiming high, it's crucial to keep the offer within a reasonable range. A price too far above Bob's perceived value ($120) could lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message implies there's room for discussion (""a fair price... what do you think?""), allowing Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
