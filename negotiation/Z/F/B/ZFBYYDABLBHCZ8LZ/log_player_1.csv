"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point. It's a fair price considering Bob values it at $120 and I need at least $80.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm being friendly and offering a rationale for the price. This helps build rapport and avoids a confrontational tone.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, it's still worth exploring if I can get a higher price from Bob.  I can still get $80 from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if I can negotiate a price closer to my initial offer of $100.  There are 8 rounds remaining, which gives me enough time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still lower than what I initially wanted.
* **Compromise Focus:** I'm highlighting the idea of splitting the difference, emphasizing a fair deal for both of us.
* **Maintaining Openness:** My message still leaves room for further negotiation, suggesting flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm still trying to save some money here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob will become inflexible and refuse to budge further.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, it's important to make a decision that secures a sale. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate or having to sell to John at my minimum price."
