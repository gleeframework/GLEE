"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair to me.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you about the budget.  How about $80? That's my absolute minimum, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
