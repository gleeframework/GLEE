Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $75? That's a fair compromise, I think."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you about the budget.  How about $80? That's my absolute minimum, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.
