"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility in the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $18000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique item, but I need to be within my means. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a more comfortable price for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this unique item. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go down to $14000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $12500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12500, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay up to $10000, and that's my final offer. I'm getting a bit worried that I might miss out on this opportunity if we don't meet at a price I'm comfortable with, so I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,8,
