"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $13,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget. How about $14,000?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",15500.0,Alice,5,
