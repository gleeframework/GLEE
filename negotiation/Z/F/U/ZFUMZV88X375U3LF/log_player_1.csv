Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason (""limited time"", ""great value"") might make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down or sell to John for your minimum price."
