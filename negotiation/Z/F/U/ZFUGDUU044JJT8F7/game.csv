"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $135. How about we try $142.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $138.75? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",138.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $138.75 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount. How about we meet at $140? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
