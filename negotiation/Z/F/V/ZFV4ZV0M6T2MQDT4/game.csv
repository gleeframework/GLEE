"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $20000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit out of my range.  I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $16000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal for yourself, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $16500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a good compromise, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $17000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $16750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16750 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $16500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",16500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $16250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,9,
