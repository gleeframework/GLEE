Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price, as it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's better than selling to John for $80. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
