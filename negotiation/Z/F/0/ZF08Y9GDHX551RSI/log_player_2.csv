"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's something you'll really value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the same product from John for $15,000.  
* Since you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $15,000 would be a better choice."
