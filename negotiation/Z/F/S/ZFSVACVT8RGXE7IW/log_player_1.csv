Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Considering its worth, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair deal that benefits us both. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message strikes a balance between confidence in the product's value and a willingness to make a deal that benefits both parties. This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
