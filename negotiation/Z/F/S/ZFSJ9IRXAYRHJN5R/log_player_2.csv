"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and value, it's worth no less than $80 to us. However, considering its exceptional worth to you at $150, I propose a special deal. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $120? This offer reflects the product's true value while ensuring a fair profit for us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money while still getting the product."
