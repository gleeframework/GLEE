"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $14,000? ",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $14,000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",15500.0,Alice,3,
