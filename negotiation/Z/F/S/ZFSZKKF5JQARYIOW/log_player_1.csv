{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be a great fit for it.  I'm offering it to you for $17,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $14,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $14,000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,250. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I think there's a good chance we can finalize a deal.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $15,250."
