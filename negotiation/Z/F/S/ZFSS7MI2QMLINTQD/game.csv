"Hi Alice, $230 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you be willing to go down to $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $100. Let's try to find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground here. How about $130? That's a significant reduction on my initial price and reflects a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down further. $130 is closer but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? ",115.0,Bob,6,
