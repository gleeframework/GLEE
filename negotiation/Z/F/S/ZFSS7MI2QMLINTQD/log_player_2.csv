"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $230 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $230. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $230
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $230 is way above my maximum budget of $80.  It's best to reject and see if we can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $230 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you be willing to go down to $80? "", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $80. I'm being upfront about my budget to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $155 is still above my budget. It's worth rejecting and seeing if we can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $100. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $100, which is still below Alice's desired price but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the need for finding a middle ground, keeping the conversation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground here. How about $130? That's a significant reduction on my initial price and reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a better offer than previous ones, it's still above my budget. I'm committed to getting the best possible deal, and with several rounds remaining, I believe I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down further. $130 is closer but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? "", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by meeting Alice halfway between our last offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
