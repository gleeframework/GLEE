Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the initial price, even if it's just ""introductory,"" can make it seem more palatable to the buyer.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately accepts, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you have room to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the introductory price, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $100. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John for $100 is a better alternative than accepting $90. It's time to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? "",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):**  By suggesting $120, we're showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and our minimum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can be persuasive as it suggests fairness and a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** We're still leaving room for potential further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $100.  There's no point in further negotiation or selling to John for the same price. Accepting Bob's offer is the optimal decision."
