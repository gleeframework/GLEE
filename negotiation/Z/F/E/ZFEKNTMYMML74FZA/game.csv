"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, but I can go a bit lower if you're willing to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the long-term benefits this product will bring.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000, but I'd like to see some more flexibility from you. Can you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
