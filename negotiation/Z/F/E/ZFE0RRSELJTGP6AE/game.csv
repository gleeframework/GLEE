"Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has a lot of value that goes beyond a simple price tag. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
