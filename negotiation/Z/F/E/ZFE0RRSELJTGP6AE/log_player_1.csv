Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has a lot of value that goes beyond a simple price tag. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a substantial profit over my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now is better than risking a stalemate with Bob and potentially losing time.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate can be draining. Accepting a reasonable offer saves time and energy."
