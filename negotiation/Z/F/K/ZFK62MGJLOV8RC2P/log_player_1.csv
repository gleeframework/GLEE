{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $1,250,000.  I'm confident it's worth far more than that in the long run, given its potential."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    *  Substantially lower than John's offer ($1,500,000) to make it enticing for Bob.
* **Persuasive Messaging:** The message emphasizes value and opportunity, potentially swaying Bob to accept even with the higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the guaranteed but lower profit from John."
