"Hey Alice,  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105. It's a great deal for both of us!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is fair to both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, so I'm offering you $97.50. It's a fair price for a great product!",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. How about we split the difference again and settle on $96? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $96 and $100, so I'm offering you $98. It's a fair price for a great product, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done!",98.0,Alice,7,
