"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. I can do $120, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value from this product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $80? That feels like a fair price to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and my previous offer of $120, so I'll counter with $100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
