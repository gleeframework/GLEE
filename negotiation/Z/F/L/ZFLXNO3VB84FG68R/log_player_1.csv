I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening that allows for potential negotiation while still positioning the product's value above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to secure a price closer to my initial asking price. This should also encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob is sticking to his offer of $950,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good amount and a significant profit. I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
