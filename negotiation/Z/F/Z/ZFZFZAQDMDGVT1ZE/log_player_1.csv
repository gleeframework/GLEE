{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but it's still below the maximum I'd be willing to accept. This allows me to potentially negotiate down to a more desirable price while still making a good profit. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $16,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $16,000? It's still a good deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $14000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price and is significantly better than selling to John. I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
