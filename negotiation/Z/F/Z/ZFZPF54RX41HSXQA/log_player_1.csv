Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price even higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, briefly highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a subtle justification for the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion. Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, moving closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000. Alice has the security of John's offer as a backup."
