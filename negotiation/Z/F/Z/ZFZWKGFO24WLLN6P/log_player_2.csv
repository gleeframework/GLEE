# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a reasonable return. I'm confident we can reach a deal.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price.  While Bob could buy from John for $1,200,000, there's still potential to get a better deal from Alice."
