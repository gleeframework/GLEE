Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $1,200,000, so $1,400,000 is a price he might be willing to consider. 
* **It's below my minimum:**  I'm willing to sell for at least $1,500,000, so I have room to negotiate down.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting my minimum. 

By starting a bit high, I can gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects, I can always counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, as I'm not willing to go higher. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a reasonable return. I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that is close to my budget and still provides you with a good return on your product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

At this point, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. I don't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth, potentially lowering my final price even further. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired return and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
