"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's desired price of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my desired value and your own minimum.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product represents is truly exceptional. To meet you halfway, I propose a revised price of $1,300,000.  I believe this fairly reflects the value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
