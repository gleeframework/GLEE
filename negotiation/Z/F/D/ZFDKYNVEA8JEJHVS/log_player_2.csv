"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, you can likely get a better price. You know John is willing to sell it for $15,000, meaning there's room for Alice to lower her price further. By rejecting her initial offer, you encourage her to potentially make a more attractive counter-offer."
