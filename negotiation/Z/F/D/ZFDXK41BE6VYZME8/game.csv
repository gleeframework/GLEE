"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm looking for a price around $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your latest offer, so I'm counteroffering at $12250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
