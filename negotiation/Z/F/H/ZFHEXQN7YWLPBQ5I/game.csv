,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",14000.0,Bob,4,
