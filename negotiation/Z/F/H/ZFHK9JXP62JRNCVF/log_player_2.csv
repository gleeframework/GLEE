"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could really benefit your operations, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its true worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
