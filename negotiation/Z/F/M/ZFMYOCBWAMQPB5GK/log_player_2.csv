"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is less than the $150 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet halfway at $115? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $115 is less than the $150 Bob would pay John.
* **Compromise is reasonable:** Alice has already lowered her price from $130 to $115, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer again, leading to a longer process and potentially costing more time.  

Accepting the offer at $115 ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further delay or a higher price."
