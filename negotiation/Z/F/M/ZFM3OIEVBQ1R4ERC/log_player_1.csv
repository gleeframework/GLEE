"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, which might make him more inclined to consider my offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I want. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering. 

**Why not sell to John?** 

Selling to John immediately guarantees me $1,200,000. However, I'm aiming for a higher profit if possible.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially reach a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his last bid.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm emphasizing the idea of finding a compromise by meeting ""in the middle.""
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to reinforce his potential benefit from accepting the offer. 

This strategy aims to maintain a sense of fairness and urgency while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is still to maximize profit, and $875,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, there's still room for a higher offer.  I'm confident I can get a better price with another counteroffer.

**Why not sell to John?**

While selling to John immediately guarantees me $1,200,000, my hope is to reach a price closer to $1,000,000 through negotiation.  There's still a good chance I can achieve this with a couple more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm open to finding common ground, I can't go much lower than $925,000. This price still offers you a significant advantage considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm firm on my price but still presenting it as a fair compromise. 
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this deal happen."" This could push Bob to reconsider.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to Bob to reinforce his potential gain. 

**Strategy:**

With each round, I'm narrowing the gap between our prices while still remaining above my minimum acceptable value.  I believe this strategy will keep the negotiation going while increasing the likelihood of a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to make a serious offer. I'll pay $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in Round 6, and I only have four rounds left before I'm forced to accept Bob's offer or sell to John.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's final offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance I could negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers is high.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is more than what I'd get from Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited time and the high risk of failing to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob, I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
