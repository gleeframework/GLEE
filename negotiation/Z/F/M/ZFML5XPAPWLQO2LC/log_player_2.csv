"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a special opportunity to secure an exceptional value for such a high-quality item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can potentially secure an even better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,200. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is a better price than John's offer of $10,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $10,000 to John is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk."
