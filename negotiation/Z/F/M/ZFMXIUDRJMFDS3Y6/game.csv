"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I believe it's worth $100 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't sell it for anything less than $80.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $80. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  However, $70 is less than I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $85?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $77? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $70, and I think that's a fair price for the product.",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I can't go as low as $77. How about $82? This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your new offer of $82, which would be $79.50. Can you consider that?",79.5,Bob,6,
