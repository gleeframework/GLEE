"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,4,
