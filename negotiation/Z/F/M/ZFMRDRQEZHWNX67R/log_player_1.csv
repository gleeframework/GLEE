"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to you than what I'm asking for. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $10,000 is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $7,000 is less than the $8,000 I'm guaranteed from John. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested. I can use the remaining rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $7,000, aiming to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my value.
* **Reiterate the value to Bob:** Emphasizing the value he'll receive reinforces the deal's attractiveness.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  This encourages a continued dialogue and helps maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price:**  $8,000 is the price I'm guaranteed from John, so I'm not losing anything by accepting.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  While I could potentially get a higher price, there's no guarantee. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale.

**Next steps:** I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
