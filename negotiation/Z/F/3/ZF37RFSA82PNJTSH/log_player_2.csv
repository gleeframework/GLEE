You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is still above Alice's minimum value of $100.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still getting a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, I can still do better. I'm willing to pay up to $120 and it's worth trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $108. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a price closer to my preferred $105. It's a compromise that may lead to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $112, which is only $2 more than my last counteroffer.  It's getting close to my preferred price, and I don't want to risk going back and forth further and potentially ending up buying from John for $120. It's a reasonable price to accept."
