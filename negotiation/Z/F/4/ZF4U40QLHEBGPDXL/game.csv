"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,200 for the product. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8750.0,Bob,4,
