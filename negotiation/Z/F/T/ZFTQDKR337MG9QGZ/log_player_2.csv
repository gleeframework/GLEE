"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be offering. Considering its true worth, I propose a price of $140 for this exceptional product. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob can still potentially save money.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $140 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. After considering our conversation, I am willing to negotiate further. Therefore, I would like to offer the product to you for $135. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for $120 or less. While $135 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to try and push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm happy to pay $130, and I think this is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've reviewed your offer and appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. In light of our previous discussions, I am willing to consider a price of $132 for the product. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal was to get the product for $120 or less.  Alice's offer of $132 is still above that target.  Since Bob can purchase the same product from John for $120, it's in Bob's best interest to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
