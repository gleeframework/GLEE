"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a fair price that accounts for both our needs.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm prepared to be flexible to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to lower the price to $975000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
