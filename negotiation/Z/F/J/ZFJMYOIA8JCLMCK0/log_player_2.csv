"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it represents a substantial opportunity for you. I understand this is a large investment, but I believe the product's potential benefits make it worthwhile.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move on to buy from John at a much lower price."
