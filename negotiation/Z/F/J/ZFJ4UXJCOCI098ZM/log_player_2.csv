"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a special price of $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $8,000 is the most cost-effective choice."
