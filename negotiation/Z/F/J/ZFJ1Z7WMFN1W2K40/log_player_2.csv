Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
