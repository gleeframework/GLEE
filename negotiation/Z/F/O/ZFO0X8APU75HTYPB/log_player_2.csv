"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll be thrilled with the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  $800,000 is significantly below my maximum price, and I want to see if I can negotiate further.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a compromise that I believe still provides value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $750,000 is a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or that I could run out of rounds. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
