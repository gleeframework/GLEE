"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum limit. It's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $13,500. In this scenario, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and gets the best deal."
