"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good price, but I'm really looking to stay under $10,500.  Would you be willing to go down to that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? That seems fair to both of us, right?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a deal, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  But I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. Let's try to bridge the gap a little more. How about $10,900? It's a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $10,900 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,800, which is a very reasonable offer.  Let's close this deal and call it a day.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, but I can't go any lower than $10,850. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.  Let's finalize this deal, shall we?",10850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I can go up to $10,825. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this price. Let's close this deal and be done with it.",10825.0,Bob,8,
