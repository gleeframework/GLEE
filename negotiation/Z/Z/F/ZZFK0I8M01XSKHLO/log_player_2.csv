"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. $9,500 is a good price, but Bob can potentially get it for even less. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows he's serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a lower price. He's also keeping in mind that he can always buy from John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails. This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and allows Bob to see if he can push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, but Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He has multiple rounds left, and he's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob continues to signal his intention to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate, but still wants a better price.  $8,500 is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and increases the chances of Alice accepting.  He's also mindful of the remaining rounds and the option of buying from John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but it's still not where Bob wants it to be.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always go to John. He's showing persistence and a willingness to negotiate, which might push Alice to lower her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to slowly increase his offer, but he's still holding out for a better price.  He's trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding stalling the negotiation too much.  $8,800 is a significant step up from his previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer.  This shows he's taking Alice's counteroffers into consideration and wants to reach an agreement, but he's not willing to cave to her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is getting close to Bob's desired price range.  With only a few rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting.  There's a good chance that if Bob continues to reject, Alice might not budge further.  It's also possible that Alice could make a higher counteroffer in the next round, and Bob might end up paying more than $9,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good deal without risking having to pay more later."
