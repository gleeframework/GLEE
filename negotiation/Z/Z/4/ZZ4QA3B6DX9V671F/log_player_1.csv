Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the value. He saves $2,000 compared to its worth to him, and you make a $2,000 profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly eliminates the need to wait for John, potentially saving you time and effort.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer.
* Bob's risk tolerance and negotiation skills could influence his decision."
