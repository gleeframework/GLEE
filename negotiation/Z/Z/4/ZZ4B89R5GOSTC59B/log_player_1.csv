Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing that it's likely higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the ""true value"" of the product to imply that my offer is reasonable, even if it's high. 

This strategy aims to get Bob thinking about the product and potentially starting the negotiation process.  I'm prepared to go lower if necessary, but I want to see where Bob lands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value might be higher, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm aiming to maximize my profit. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Minimum Value:**  I'm unwilling to sell below my minimum value, as it would be a financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.  
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'll now counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the product. While $12,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to accept $16,500. This takes into account the value of the product and offers a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $16,500 is a significant jump from Bob's $12,000, but it's still below my initial asking price of $20,000. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, highlighting that the price is fair. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the Gap:**  Reduce the gap between our desired prices.
* **Encourage Acceptance:**  By showing flexibility, I'm hoping to make my offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Leave Room for More Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still prepared to make further concessions, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, based on my research and understanding of the market value, I believe $14500 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Considering:

* **Reaching Agreement:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiation.
* **Close to Minimum:**  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $14,500 is within a reasonable range.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better outcome. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $14,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
