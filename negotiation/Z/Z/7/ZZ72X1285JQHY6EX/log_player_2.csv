"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($12,000) is less than your maximum price ($15,000).** 
* Accepting her offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'd go lower, and you risk losing the deal."
