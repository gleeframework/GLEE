"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that I can always come down. My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $15,000, I believe there's still room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $18,000? This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come up to $16,000. This is a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it. I'm also concerned that I'm running out of rounds and might have to sell to John for the lower price."
