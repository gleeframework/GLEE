Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum selling price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high with $9,500 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" subtly implies you have other options and encourages Bob to act sooner rather than later.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid him declining and forcing you to sell to John."
