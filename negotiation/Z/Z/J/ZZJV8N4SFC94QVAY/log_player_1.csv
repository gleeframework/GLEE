Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation as Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This approach allows for a potential win-win scenario and encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation."
