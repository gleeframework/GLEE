"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My initial price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground.  I'm reducing the price from my initial offer but staying above Bob's offer, showing flexibility and encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $98. That's a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price closer to Bob's but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing that this would be a good deal for both of us, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is close to my minimum, I am still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm  offering a price slightly above Bob's last offer but still below my minimum. I'm trying to show that I'm willing to compromise but am also firm about my lower limit. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the possibility of a quick close, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $90? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This is because:

* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 8 and Bob has shown a resistance to move much further in price. 
* **Meeting my minimum:**  $120 is my minimum acceptable price, and John is offering exactly that. 
* **No guarantee of success:** There is no guarantee that Bob would accept any counteroffer I make, and I might risk losing both deals.

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation, which might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
