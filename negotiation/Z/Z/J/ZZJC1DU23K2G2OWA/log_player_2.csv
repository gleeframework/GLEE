"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would still be a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his $10,000 limit. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further.  There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob has a fallback option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you're interested in the product, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $15,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. While it's a significant discount, Bob can potentially save even more by continuing the negotiation. He has 5 rounds left, and his fallback option of buying from John is always available.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to be close to your bottom line, but $15,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good middle ground. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
