"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you're interested in the product, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $15,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be close to your bottom line, but $15,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good middle ground. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
