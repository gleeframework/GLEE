{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still within a range that's reasonable for both of us. I'm hoping that this will be enough to get Bob to agree."
