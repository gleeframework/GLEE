,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. This is a fair price that still allows you to get a good deal, while also reflecting the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $9500. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $10500. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and it's still a good price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $10500 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $9800. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",9800.0,Bob,6,
