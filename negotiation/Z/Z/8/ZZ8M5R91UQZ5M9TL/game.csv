"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000, but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value this product offers. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue talking.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, which is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9800.0,Bob,6,
