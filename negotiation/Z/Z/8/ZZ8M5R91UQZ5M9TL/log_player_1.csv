{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, indicating I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though Bob is interested, I have the option to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I keep the door open for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not walking away. I'm making a counteroffer that's a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Higher than Bob's offer:** $10,500 is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's significantly lower than my initial asking price.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I end with a question to keep the conversation going and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm aiming for.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get Bob to come up to a price closer to $12,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer again, I maintain my position and show that I'm not desperate to sell. This increases my leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000, but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value this product offers. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue talking.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down to $11,000, but still holding out for a higher price than his last offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation constructive and hopefully lead to a deal.
* **Openness to continue:** I explicitly state my willingness to continue the conversation, showing a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, which is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **John's offer is much better:**  I'm guaranteed to make $15,000 by selling to John, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will come up any further. It's not worth risking a lower price when I have a sure thing with John.

Selling to John is the most logical and financially beneficial decision at this point."
