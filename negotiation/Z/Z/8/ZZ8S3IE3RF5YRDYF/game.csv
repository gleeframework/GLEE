"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
