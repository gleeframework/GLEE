{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point by continuing the negotiation.  I'm also not ready to give up on the potential for a better outcome just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still offers a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I still have several rounds left. I'm confident I can find a more favorable deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to compromise. I'm happy to come down a bit more, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  We've reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a better result, and I risk losing valuable time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed deal with John. 

Selling to John for $10,000 is the most logical choice at this point. It guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation leading to an even lower price."
