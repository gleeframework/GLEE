"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it for $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This is to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while also preserving my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I have 6 rounds left and John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, which is my absolute minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will accept it since it's a good deal for him, considering his valuation of the product. However, if he rejects it, I have the option to sell to John for $120."
