(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000, and both Alice and John are offering the product for $1,000,000, there's no financial advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to consider other potential sellers who might offer a lower price."
