Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $16,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, subtly highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or tries to haggle."
