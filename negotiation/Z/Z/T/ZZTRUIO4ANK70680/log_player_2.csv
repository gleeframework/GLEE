"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 9 more rounds, so there's time to try to get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer significantly lowers the price but leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Middle ground:** $100 is the midpoint between your ideal price and Alice's offer, making it a fair starting point for the counteroffer.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 8 rounds left, so you can afford to be slightly more aggressive without risking running out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.**  $110 is only $10 more than your counteroffer, and within your budget.
* **Further negotiation might be too risky.** You have limited rounds, and while you could try to get a lower price, there's a chance Alice might reject your counteroffer again, leaving you with no deal.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If you're not happy with the deal, you can still buy from John.

**Overall:**  It's a good compromise to accept this offer, ensuring you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
