Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob gets from the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation flowing. 

This offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, while also giving me a clear path to sell to John if Bob proves unwilling to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  Selling at $900,000 would result in a major loss for me.
* **Rejecting gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer.** I can try to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum without conceding too much.
* **I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000.**  This means I'm not under pressure to accept a bad deal. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway,  but I can't go lower than $1,050,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate but establishing a firmer lower limit.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using phrases like ""meet you halfway"" and ""good deal"" to emphasize that I'm trying to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he gains from the product, subtly encouraging him to consider a higher price.
* **Clear Price:**  I'm stating a specific price point to avoid ambiguity and keep the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer offers a compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm not thrilled with this offer, it's possible that further negotiation with Bob could lead to a higher price. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I risk losing the sale entirely. 

Given the potential for future negotiation and the risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point."
