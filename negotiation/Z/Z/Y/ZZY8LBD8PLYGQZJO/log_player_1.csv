"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it'll be a great asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting above Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, so I don't want to price myself out of a potential deal with Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for multiple counteroffers and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I still have 9 rounds to potentially reach a higher price with Bob. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'll need to counter with a price closer to my desired value to see if Bob is willing to move closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to demonstrate my commitment to working with you. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price and highlight the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, as I'm not yet at my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This amount still allows me to invest in the product while staying within my financial limits.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in raising your offer. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,400,000 to ensure a mutually beneficial deal.

Let's find a compromise that reflects both our needs and the future potential of this investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob in this last round."
