"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $135. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
