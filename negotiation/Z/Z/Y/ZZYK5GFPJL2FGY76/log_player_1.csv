"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell for my minimum price of $120,  I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.  Bob's offer is too low, so I'll reject and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.  Hopefully, this shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
