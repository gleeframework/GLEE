Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging that I have a profitable alternative if he declines."
