"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer $500000 for it. This is a fair price considering it's still within my budget and leaves room for us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $500000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $675000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and uniqueness.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $675000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. How about $600000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $700000. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",650000.0,Alice,5,
