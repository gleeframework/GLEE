Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer $500000 for it. This is a fair price considering it's still within my budget and leaves room for us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
