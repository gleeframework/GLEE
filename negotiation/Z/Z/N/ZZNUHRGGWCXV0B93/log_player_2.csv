"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer. You can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $100 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, and I'm hoping this will initiate a back-and-forth process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get her down to closer to my initial counteroffer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility in her offer, and I'm increasing my counteroffer to $110, which is a halfway point between her last offer and my previous one.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the pressure on for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer of $125 is now within my acceptable range. While I'd prefer to get it for $110, there's a risk that if I reject her offer, she might raise it again, or I could run out of negotiation rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept her offer and secure the product at a good price."
