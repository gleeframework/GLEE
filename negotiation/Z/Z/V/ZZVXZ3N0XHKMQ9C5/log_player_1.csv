Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $10,000 is too low for me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we're getting close to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is still a good deal for me. It's better than selling to John for $12,000 and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product."
