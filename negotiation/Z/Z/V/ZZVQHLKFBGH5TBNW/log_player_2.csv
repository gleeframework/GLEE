# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. This is a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small decrease in price. It's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and save the potential hassle and time of continued negotiation."
