"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant investment for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, and I'm confident this price reflects the value we're both getting out of this deal. Let's finalize it at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
