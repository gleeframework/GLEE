{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll be prepared to counter if he rejects, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I need to get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but if he continues to be unwilling to budge, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm proposing $1,300,000 as my counteroffer. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's proposal. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes that the product is valuable and I'm not willing to sell for a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000 for your product. I believe this price strikes a balance between your valuation and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to Bob entirely.  Furthermore, it's likely that the extra $250,000 from John would be overshadowed by the cost of finding and negotiating with another buyer."
