"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm thinking of selling it for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little to meet you halfway. How about $107? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. $107 is closer to her value than ours. We'll continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $98?"",
""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're proposing a price close to the midpoint between our previous offer ($90) and Alice's counteroffer ($107). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price advantageous to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to go down to $103, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $103
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could push a bit further, $103 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's $120 offer. It's best to accept now and secure the product at a good price."
