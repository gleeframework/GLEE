Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $80, so I'm not setting the price too high to scare him off. I'm confident that if he rejects this offer, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $90 is less than my initial asking price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and significantly higher than what Bob values it at ($80).  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's a risk of losing Bob altogether and ending up selling to John for $100. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a good price."
