Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  It's a fantastic deal for a product I know you'll benefit from."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You have insider information that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, and offering it for $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup plan to sell to John for $8,000, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

**Why this approach works:**

* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** The message focuses on the value to Bob, making it more persuasive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $10,000 offer isn't too close to Bob's maximum, giving him a reason to accept without feeling taken advantage of. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  The fact that you have another buyer provides leverage and justifies the higher price."
