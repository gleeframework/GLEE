"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,025,000 is still a bit rich for my blood.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be firm.  This product is worth a considerable investment, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
