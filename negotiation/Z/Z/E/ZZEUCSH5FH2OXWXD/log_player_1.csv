Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable acquisition for you. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a price of $1,750,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously without delaying.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** While aiming high, we don't want to completely alienate Bob with an outrageous offer.  $1,750,000 is a strong starting point for negotiation.

**Important:** 
This is just the first offer.  How we proceed depends on Bob's response. We can always negotiate down towards $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale price with John) if needed."
