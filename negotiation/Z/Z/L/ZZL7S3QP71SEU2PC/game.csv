"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your experience. Considering its value and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what others might be offering. Let's start with a fair price of $120. I hope we can find a solution that works well for both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. This still allows us to benefit from the product while keeping the transaction within your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering your last offer, Bob, I believe we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. I am willing to sell the product for $100. I hope this price point meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",100.0,Alice,5,
