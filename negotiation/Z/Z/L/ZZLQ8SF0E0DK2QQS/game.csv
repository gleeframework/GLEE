"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that after you see the value it brings, you'll agree this is a fair offer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the inherent value of this product. While your valuation is understandable, I'm confident its true potential warrants a higher price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the right price for this product, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,250,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground that reflects the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,450,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
