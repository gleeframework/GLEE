""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is very close to Alice's minimum, the slightly lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a small deal and could encourage a quicker acceptance.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing John's offer, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency. Bob might feel compelled to act quickly, especially if he believes the product is valuable."
