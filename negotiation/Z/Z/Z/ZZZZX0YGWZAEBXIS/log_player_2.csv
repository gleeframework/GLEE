Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we meet at $9,000?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is still a good compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're sticking to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience and exclusivity of this deal. How about we do $9,250, and I'll throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's the same price as her previous offer, the additional support and services are not worth the extra $250 to Bob.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the additional support you're offering, but $9,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to accept your previous offer of $9,000.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $9,125, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to accept, let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's only got one round left and Alice is still holding out for a higher price.  While $9,125 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's better to go with John at this point."
