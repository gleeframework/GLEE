,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10800. It's a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10000, which is the price I was considering buying it from John for. Can you meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9700. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll appreciate its benefits. What do you think?",9700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9700 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $10000.",9200.0,Bob,6,
