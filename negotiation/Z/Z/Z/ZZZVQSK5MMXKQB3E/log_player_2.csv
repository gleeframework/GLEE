"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $125 just doesn't work for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, but slowly.  While I could try to negotiate further, $135 is a reasonable price and a good compromise.  It's not worth risking losing the deal at this point."
