**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  As Bob, your goal is to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure the product from John for $10,000, which is your maximum budget. This strategy ensures you get the product while minimizing your expenditure."
