**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear his upper limit might not reach our desired outcome. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point than risk Bob not reaching our minimum acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
