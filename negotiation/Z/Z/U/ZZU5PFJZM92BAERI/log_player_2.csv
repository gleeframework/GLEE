Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $650000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $675000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While $675,000 is still above my ideal price point, it's getting closer to my budget, and continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal entirely. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
