I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's still a decent profit for me, and it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While it's better than his initial rejection, I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still leaving some room for profit for me. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him, but I'm also prepared to go another round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $14,000, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, he might not come back with a better one.  I'm also concerned about wasting time with further negotiations, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid further risk."
