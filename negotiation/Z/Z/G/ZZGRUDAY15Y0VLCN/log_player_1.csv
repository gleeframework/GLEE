I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation but also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $795000 for the product. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $795,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely that we'll be able to reach an agreement. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $800,000."
