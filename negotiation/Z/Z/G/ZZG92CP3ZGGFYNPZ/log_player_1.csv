"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110.  This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $98 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not yet at my minimum acceptable price and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm offering $102. This is another small concession, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than Bob's last offer. We're getting closer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  To avoid risking a lower price or losing time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
