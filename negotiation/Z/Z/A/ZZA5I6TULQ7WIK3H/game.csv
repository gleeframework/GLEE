"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $12,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
