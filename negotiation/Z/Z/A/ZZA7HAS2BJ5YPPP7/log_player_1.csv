Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $950,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** Mentioning the product's value to him might encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to respond, making the negotiation feel less confrontational. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a price closer to the product's value to Bob while leaving some wiggle room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me. While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to the product's value to Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Consider the significant value this product holds for you - it's worth $1,000,000! I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $850,000. This allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Justification:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering $850,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I also reiterate the product's value to Bob to strengthen my position.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I highlight that this price will be beneficial for both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages further negotiation and avoids an antagonistic atmosphere. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price range, I still feel we can find a solution that benefits both parties. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting this offer secures a deal and guarantees my minimum profit. It also avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal. 

Selling to John for the same price would be a neutral outcome, but this deal ensures I close the sale with Bob, who is potentially a more valuable customer for future transactions."
