"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $850000. Considering its true value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $860000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delays.",860000.0,Bob,4,
