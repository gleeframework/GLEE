# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low. Let's try $1,100,000 again. This is a fair price for both of us.  It's closer to your last offer and closer to my desired price.  Let me know if you're willing to move to this compromise.

Alice is holding firm at $1,100,000 and it seems unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer saves $100,000 compared to John's price."
