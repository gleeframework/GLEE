"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while also ensuring I'm not giving away too much value too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, as there are still rounds available, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also allows me to hold out for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. With several rounds remaining, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making a small concession by lowering the price to $1,150,000.  This demonstrates flexibility, but I'm still keeping the price above Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this will convince him to come closer to my desired range."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only three rounds remaining, the negotiations haven't yielded a price close to my minimum.  I'm running out of time to get a better offer from Bob, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids further risk of getting a worse price."
