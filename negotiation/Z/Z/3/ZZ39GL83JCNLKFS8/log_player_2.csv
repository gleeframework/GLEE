(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The offer from Alice is too high, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance that Alice will be willing to drop the price to a point where it's worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point for getting a better deal, especially since you have the alternative option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not the best price.  It's worth trying to get a bit closer to my target price before considering buying from John.  A counteroffer might lead to a better deal."

This is my final offer. It's the price I'm willing to pay, and it's very close to what I would pay John. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John."
