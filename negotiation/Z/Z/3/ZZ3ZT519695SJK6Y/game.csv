"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is already a concession from my original offer of $900,000, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
