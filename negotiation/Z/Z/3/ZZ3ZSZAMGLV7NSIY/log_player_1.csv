Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's valuation:**  $11,500 is below Bob's value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:**  This offer leaves space for you to make concessions if Bob counteroffers, while also giving you a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $10,500 is below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Selling to John for $10,000 would be the same outcome at this point.
* **There's room for a counteroffer:**  You can still make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to formulate a counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind that he's willing to pay up to $12,000.  You'll want to find a price that's above your minimum but still attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above your minimum:**  $11,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Moving closer to Bob's valuation:**  $11,000 is halfway between your last offer and Bob's offer, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a bit of wiggle room in case Bob needs to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum, but not quite there:** $10,750 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still a bit below.  While it's tempting to accept, you might be able to get slightly more.
* **Potential for one more counteroffer:** You have the option to make one more counteroffer, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to decide on a final counteroffer. Since this might be your last chance, you'll want to make it as attractive as possible to Bob while still staying above your minimum.  Consider offering a price just above your minimum, perhaps $10,800, to see if Bob will accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800 for this final offer. This is the best I can do, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly above minimum:**  $10,800 is just above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Final offer:**  Stating it's your final offer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value adds weight to your offer. 

**Outcome:**

This final counteroffer gives Bob a chance to accept a price that's still slightly above your minimum, but it also positions you to accept John's offer if Bob rejects."
