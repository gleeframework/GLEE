"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1200000, which is a bit above your last offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my minimum price range.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
