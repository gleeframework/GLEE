,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $112? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $108.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards an agreement.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. How about we meet at $115? I think it's a good compromise, considering the product's value and your budget.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal, so how about we split the difference and go with $110? ",110.0,Bob,6,
