"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
