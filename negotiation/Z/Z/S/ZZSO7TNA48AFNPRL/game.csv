"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9500. How about we settle on $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $8000, as I mentioned earlier. Can we try to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to think about other options. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
