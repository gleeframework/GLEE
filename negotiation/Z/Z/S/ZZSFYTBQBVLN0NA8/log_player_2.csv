You can do better than $135.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a lower price."

This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to Alice.  It's a good starting point for negotiation and gives Alice some room to compromise while still saving you money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 130}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, but still below Alice's last offer. It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:

```

Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with her.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
