"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
