{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he might be willing to pay slightly less.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer and for me to make adjustments if necessary. 
* **It's higher than my minimum:** I'm comfortable selling to John for $10,000, so this offer ensures I make a profit. 

I'm eager to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach an agreeable price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to try and get closer to my original offer of $14,000.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my desired price of $13,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original offer, accepting this offer will still result in a significant profit. It's also likely that further negotiation with Bob will result in a lower price, so I'm choosing to accept his offer now."
