"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer but still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do $1,075,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
