"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for him. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $10,000. Offering $9,000 starts the negotiation by showing Bob's serious intent to buy the product while also pushing for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has 7 rounds left, so there's room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's value, but still wants a better deal. $10,500 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to meet halfway, but also leaves room for potential further negotiation.  He's also aware of the time limit, so he needs to find a balance between being too aggressive and letting the opportunity slip away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, there's still room to negotiate. Bob has 5 rounds remaining and can continue to try and get a better deal. He's already shown willingness to compromise and has a clear understanding of Alice's minimum price, making further negotiation possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's perceived value, but still trying to save money. This offer is a small increase from the previous one, demonstrating his willingness to compromise but still wanting a better deal. He has 4 rounds remaining, and this offer gives him more negotiating room without pushing Alice away entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's desired price range and is a significant improvement over her previous offers. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to compromise and is likely to find a better deal than with John."
