"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1300000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  It's a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
