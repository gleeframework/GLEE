"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still within the range where there's potential for negotiation.  This gives Bob some room to feel like he's getting a good deal while ensuring I don't immediately give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a significant loss. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1300000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  It's a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is within a reasonable range for me.  Accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale that's not too far from my minimum acceptable price."
