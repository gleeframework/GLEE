"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product. It offers immense value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  We begin with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This anchors the negotiation high. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""immense value"" and ""potential,"" we provide a reason for the high price without revealing our hand. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves ample room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds.

The goal is to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to engage at this level. It also allows us to potentially secure a deal closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product and understand its potential benefits. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). We have room to negotiate and plenty of rounds left. We'll aim to bring him closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the price you've suggested doesn't reflect the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's consider $1,850,000."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and maintain a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Concession:** By offering to ""meet halfway,"" we demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, this ""halfway"" point is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to our desired outcome.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point without directly dismissing Bob's perception. 

This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to our range while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This still reflects a significant investment for me, but I believe it's the best I can offer at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
