"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential return on investment. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $1400000. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,8,
