Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Here's the reasoning behind the offer:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **My Floor:** I have a minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (from John's offer).
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves me with $200,000 of potential profit to negotiate.
* **The Offer:**  Offering $1,150,000 splits the difference, giving Bob a good deal and me a significant profit.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **High Probability of Acceptance:** Bob is likely to accept this offer, as he gets the product for $50,000 less than his perceived value.
* **Maximizes Profit:** This offer secures a $150,000 profit for me, which is significantly better than the $100,000 profit from selling to John. 

Of course, there's always a chance Bob could reject the offer.  However, the odds are in my favor, and the offer is strategically positioned to maximize my chances of earning the highest possible profit."
