"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still out of my price range. Let's try $950,000. This reflects a significant reduction from your previous offer and shows my genuine interest in purchasing the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think this product has the potential to bring significant returns to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one. I'm offering $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable price. Let's make this deal happen!",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,030,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
