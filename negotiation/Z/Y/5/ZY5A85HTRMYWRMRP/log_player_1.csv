Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($149) leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really keen, though unlikely.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might nudge Bob to act quickly rather than overthink the offer. 

**Important Note:** While Bob's perceived value is $80, you don't have information about his willingness to pay.  This strategy focuses on maximizing your potential gain given your guaranteed sale to John."
