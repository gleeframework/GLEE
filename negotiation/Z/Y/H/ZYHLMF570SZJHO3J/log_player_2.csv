"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000. There's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable paying.  While it's a step in the right direction, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting allows Bob to continue haggling and potentially get closer to his desired price point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  That's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's a fair compromise, and accepting it allows Bob to secure the product at a good price. While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John is too high."
