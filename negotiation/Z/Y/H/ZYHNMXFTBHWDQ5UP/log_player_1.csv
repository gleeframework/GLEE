Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can do better. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $105 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $103 is a decent price and it's getting close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for more."
