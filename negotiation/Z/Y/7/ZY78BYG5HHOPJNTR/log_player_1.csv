Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might try to negotiate a lower price. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly if needed. 
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage, but it's still ideal to secure the deal with Bob if possible to avoid potential delays."
