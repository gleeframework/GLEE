"I'm excited to offer you this great product for a competitive price of $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me at most. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 to make it worth your while.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I could potentially go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a bit higher than your limit, but still below my minimum. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",11000.0,Alice,5,
