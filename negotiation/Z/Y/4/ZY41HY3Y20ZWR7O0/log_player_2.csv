"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially even more than $1500000.  I understand you may not know the full extent of its worth, but I'm confident it could be a game-changer for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $2000000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly special at a price that could be incredibly advantageous.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While she claims the product is worth more, you don't have enough information to trust that assessment. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price within your budget."
