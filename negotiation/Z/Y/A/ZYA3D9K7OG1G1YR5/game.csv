"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to meet me at $875000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000 either. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $870000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
