"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm starting with a price of $1800000, reflecting its unique qualities and potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply not feasible for me at this time.  I understand you have budget constraints, but this product truly is exceptional. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which still allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. While I understand the value in your product, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum budget of $800000. I hope we can find a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $800000 is just not a price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, offering a price of $1150000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this incredible product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given the situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1150000. I would like to propose a final offer of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, but this is my final offer.  This is a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am now prepared to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal will allow us to finalize our agreement.",950000.0,Bob,8,
