"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm also not quite ready to sell to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply not feasible for me at this time.  I understand you have budget constraints, but this product truly is exceptional. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which still allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. While I understand the value in your product, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum budget of $800000. I hope we can find a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still far too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm also not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $800,000 is just not a price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, offering a price of $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this incredible product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given the situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1150000. I would like to propose a final offer of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  This is a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting really close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm worried that Bob will just keep offering small increases and I'll end up with less than I want. It's getting late in the negotiations and I'm not confident I can get much higher. John's offer of $1,200,000 is a guaranteed deal, and it's time to secure that."
