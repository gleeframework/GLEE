"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to a final compromise.  How about we settle on $850,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal on a valuable product.  Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,5,
