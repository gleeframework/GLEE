Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to a final compromise.  How about we settle on $850,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal on a valuable product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000, and it's always possible further negotiation could fail.  It's better to secure the product at John's price of $800,000 and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
