{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,300,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message polite and direct, focusing on the value proposition for Bob. I haven't revealed my minimum price, as that could weaken my bargaining position. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high-ish offer, I'm aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give me insight into how eager he is to buy. 
* **Set a strong starting point:** This makes it more likely that any counteroffers from Bob will be closer to my desired price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth process, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and my next move, keeping in mind the value to me and the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is simply too low to consider at this point.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer.  I'll need to carefully consider my next move to maximize my earnings while keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved down to $900,000, which is still above my minimum value and represents a substantial discount from my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a respectable price.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and expressed my willingness to compromise while highlighting the value proposition for him. This helps to keep the negotiation open and positive.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By moving down from my initial price, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiating.
* **Maintain a respectable price:**  $900,000 still represents a significant profit for me.
* **Keep the conversation going:** This counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to respond and potentially move closer to a mutually agreeable price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and continue to negotiate, while keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that drastically undervalues the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range. However, I will also be closely monitoring the situation and considering the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if it seems like negotiations with Bob are going nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to a final compromise.  How about we settle on $850,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal on a valuable product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've raised my offer to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer but still below my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also want to secure a decent profit.
* **Message:** I've highlighted Bob's willingness to negotiate and emphasized the benefits of this price for both of us. This aims to create a sense of urgency and a win-win scenario.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:**  $850,000 is still a substantial price for Bob, and I believe it's a fair compromise given his initial offer.
* **Show flexibility:** I've continued to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but haven't completely given in.
* **Increase the pressure:**  By suggesting it's a ""final compromise,"" I'm aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider my options, including selling to John for $1,500,000. However, I'll also be ready to make a final counteroffer if Bob comes back with a slightly higher price."
