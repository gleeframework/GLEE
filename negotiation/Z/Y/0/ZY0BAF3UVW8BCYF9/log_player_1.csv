Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or a potentially quick sale at a high profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. This knowledge allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 
* **Psychology:** Offering a price of $15,000 creates the perception that the product is highly valuable. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point anchors the discussion at a higher value."
