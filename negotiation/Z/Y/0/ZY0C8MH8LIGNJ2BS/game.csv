"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. I've done my research, and I know the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1080000. It's a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",1080000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I've made it clear that $1000000 is my maximum offer. I'm not willing to pay more than that. I'm starting to think that maybe I should just walk away and buy the product from John for $1500000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,6,,
