Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 in the right hands.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair and attractive offer. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while staying above our minimum ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but leaving room for negotiation allows Bob to feel involved and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob justifies the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy it for $800,000 gives us a strong fallback position.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
