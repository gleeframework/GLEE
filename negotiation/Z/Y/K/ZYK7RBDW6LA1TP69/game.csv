"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000, recognizing the value you see in it. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and allows me to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be around $750,000 for it to make sense for me. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
