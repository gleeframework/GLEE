"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer on the table, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than that. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to make it happen today if you're willing to meet me there.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
