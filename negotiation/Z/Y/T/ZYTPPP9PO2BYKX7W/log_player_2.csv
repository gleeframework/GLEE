"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is cheaper than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

While $115 is better than $130, it's still above your desired price point. You can still try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
