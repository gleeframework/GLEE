Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I'm not willing to pay the full $14,000, I'll offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 7
