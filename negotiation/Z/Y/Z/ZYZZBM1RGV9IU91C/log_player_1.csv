Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it will bring to my endeavors.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this price is a good compromise, considering the value it will bring to my endeavors.

Even though we're getting closer, we're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profit Margin:** While not ideal, $1,850,000 is still a significant profit over John's $1,500,000 offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging on negotiations further could make Bob less willing to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's no guarantee that we can negotiate Bob up further, and we risk losing him entirely if we push too hard. 

It's a good business decision to take a very strong offer rather than risk getting stuck with a lower one."
