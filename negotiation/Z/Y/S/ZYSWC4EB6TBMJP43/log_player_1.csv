"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This is to test the waters and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also leaving room for potential concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I will counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a favorable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $860,000 is only $40,000 less than my initial asking price, and with 6 rounds remaining, it's a good deal. I'm confident I can close with Bob, so I'll accept this offer."
