"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at that price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $7000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $8000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
