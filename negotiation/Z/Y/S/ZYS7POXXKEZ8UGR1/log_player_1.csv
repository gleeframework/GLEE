Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Offering the product at $14,000 sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You can adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
