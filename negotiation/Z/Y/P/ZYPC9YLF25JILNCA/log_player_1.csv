Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $120 value Bob places on the product. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a way that encourages Bob to accept while still giving you the potential to earn more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting his offer allows you to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than your ideal, it's very close to your minimum and it seems like he's ready to close the deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
