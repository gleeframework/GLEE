"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,400. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",12400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $12,400 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,200? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can make a deal at this price.",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this negotiation.  Let's aim for a final price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $12,300, which is just a little bit above your last offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",12300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the price I was originally considering for buying from John. I'm really hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,8,
