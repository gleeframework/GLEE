Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want the best price, starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially earning me even more.
* **Appeal to Value:** My message subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value of $100, encouraging him to consider the deal.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the chance of securing a deal with Bob."
