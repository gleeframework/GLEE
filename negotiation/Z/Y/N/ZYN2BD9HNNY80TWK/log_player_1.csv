Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I can likely do better with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price that's still within your budget and closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $10,000 is a fair price for this product. Could we possibly come to an agreement at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my target price, I still think I can get a little more.  I'm also mindful that I have several rounds left and can still sell to John for $12,000 if need be."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go lower than $10,250.  This is a significant compromise on my part.  If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I would like to stick to my original offer of $10,000. Is there any way we could reach a mutual agreement at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're very close to a deal, I'm still not ready to accept $10,000.  With several rounds remaining, I have a few more chances to try to get a higher price.  Also, I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I need to."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet my budget. I would like to stick to my original offer of $10,000. I hope we can find a way to agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob is unwilling to budge.  It's not worth risking losing the deal with John for a small increase in price.  $12,000 is a good price, and I can secure the deal."
