"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $110, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm stating that I'm open to negotiation to make Bob feel like he has some control in the process and encourage him to counter-offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm mentioning that the product is ""amazing"" to pique Bob's interest and highlight its potential value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. Depending on his reaction, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round.  If he rejects my offer, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price, make a counter-offer, or explore the alternative option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to be strategic about how much I lower my price to ensure I'm still getting a good deal. However, I also want to avoid pushing Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $105. I believe the product is worth that, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering at $105, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize its worth and justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""I believe the product is worth that"" and ""I'm confident you'll be happy with it"" to maintain a positive tone and encourage a deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to consider whether to lower my price further or explore selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that amount. It's important for me to remember my own value for the product and ensure I'm not giving it away too cheaply.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob again, aiming for a price between $95 and $100. I'll continue to reiterate the value of the product and try to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. However, I'll also keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob continues to stall."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. How about we split the difference this time and go with $97.50? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $95. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and conversational tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob and encourage him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this offer, I'll close the deal.  If he rejects, I'll need to make a decision on whether to lower my price further, explore selling to John, or try to negotiate with Bob again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm open to negotiation, we've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it seems like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. I've also been willing to compromise and make concessions, but it's becoming clear that we have different expectations for the value of the product.

To avoid further delays and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John, I've decided to sell the product to John for $100. It's a fair price that meets my minimum requirement, and it's important for me to secure a sale while I have the chance."
