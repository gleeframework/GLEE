I'm starting with my ideal price of $12,000. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

I'm offering Bob $11,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's closer to my ideal price, but it's also more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price, especially considering John is waiting in the wings with a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering Bob $10,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to agree, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've gone through several rounds of negotiations and it's clear he's not willing to go higher. I've already lost some time negotiating.  Selling to John is the most efficient decision, securing my ideal price and saving further negotiation time."
