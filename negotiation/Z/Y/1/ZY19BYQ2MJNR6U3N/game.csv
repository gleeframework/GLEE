"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $850,000?  This gives you a significant profit, and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, and I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer you $700,000 for the product. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still getting you a good price. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This would give you a fair profit, and I would be happy to finally close the deal.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
