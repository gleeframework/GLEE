Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $850,000?  This gives you a significant profit, and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This would give you a fair profit, and I would be happy to finally close the deal.  What do you think?
