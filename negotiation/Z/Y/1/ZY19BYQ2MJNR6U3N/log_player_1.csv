Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $600,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $850,000?  This gives you a significant profit, and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit, and I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer you $700,000 for the product. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still getting you a good price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still far from my desired price. I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can get closer to an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This would give you a fair profit, and I would be happy to finally close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
