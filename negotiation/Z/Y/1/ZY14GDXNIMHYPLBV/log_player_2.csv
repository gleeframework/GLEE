"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90.
* You have a fallback option of buying from John for $100.
* Since Alice's offer is closer to your valuation than John's, but still above your ideal price point, you should reject it. You can then proceed with John's offer, which is still within your budget."
