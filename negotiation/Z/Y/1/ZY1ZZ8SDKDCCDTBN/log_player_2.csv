"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable asset that I believe will be of significant benefit to your business.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for a lower price, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
