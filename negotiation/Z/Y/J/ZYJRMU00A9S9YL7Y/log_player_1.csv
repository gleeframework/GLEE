Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While we're still above John's offer, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $975,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out in later rounds."
