"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $950,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our needs.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $975,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",975000.0,Alice,5,
