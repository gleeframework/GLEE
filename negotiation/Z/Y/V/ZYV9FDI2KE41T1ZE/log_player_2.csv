"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While I'm willing to pay more than my initial $800,000, $950,000 is still outside my acceptable range. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $950,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our needs.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $975,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and her offer is still too high.  I've already reached my personal limit of what I'm willing to pay.  While I could continue negotiating, it's looking like this deal might take many more rounds to finalize, and I'm not confident she'll come down to a price I'm happy with.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and save time and effort."
