"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,900. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,
