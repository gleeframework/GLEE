"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is more than your desired maximum of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to your target price, you still want to see if you can get it even lower. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,900. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've gotten down to $8,900, but you're still $900 over your target of $8,000.  Since you have the option to purchase from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save the money."
