Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my ideal price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,250,000? This is still a fair price given the product's value, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm not going to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,250,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,220,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,230,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will make this deal happen. Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 1230000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,220,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,230,000, I'm running out of time and $1,225,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,200,000."
