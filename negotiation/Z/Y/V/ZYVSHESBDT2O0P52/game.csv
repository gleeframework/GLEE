"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $9500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you, given its worth of $8000 to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product's quality, $9500 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $8500. Considering the product's quality and the value it holds for you, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while maintaining a fair deal for you. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. This would give you a good profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $8875 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",8875.0,Alice,5,
