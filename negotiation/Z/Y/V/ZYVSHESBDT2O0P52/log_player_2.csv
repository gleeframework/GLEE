"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $9500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you, given its worth of $8000 to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $8500. Considering the product's quality and the value it holds for you, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while maintaining a fair deal for you. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  You should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. You can likely secure a better deal by either making another counteroffer or buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. This would give you a good profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $8875 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While it's close, you can get the product from John for a lower price. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and continuing the negotiation could waste time. It's more efficient to simply buy the product from John and secure the best price."
