Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still staying within a range that's profitable for me."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,500,000. This is my bottom line, as I'm willing to sell to John for this price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him considering his value for the product."
