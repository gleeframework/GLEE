"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price, but I'm hoping to secure a good deal quickly and avoid dragging out the negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll counter with a price closer to what I believe is fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and avoid a stalemate.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price given the value of the product.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John as I only have five rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're now in round 6, and Bob has only increased his offer by $25,000 from the previous round.  I'm running out of time to reach my desired price and risk getting stuck with a lower price than John is offering. It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
