Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I'd accept from John, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully captures some of the extra value the product holds for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a drastic reduction from my initial offer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a prolonged back-and-forth  is not worth it.  I'm better off selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
