"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I have to consider my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? I'm confident this price still represents a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,200 still feels a little low to me. Let's compromise at $11,500. This way, we both make some concessions, and we can move forward with the deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to accepting, but I still think $11,500 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm willing to make a significant concession, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is my final offer,  Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,7,
