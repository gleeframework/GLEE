"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's friendly:**  Building a positive relationship can help with negotiations.
* **It encourages a response:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts makes him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, you have room to negotiate for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you can counter-offer and potentially get closer to your desired price of $10,000. You're also still better off with John's offer of $8,000 than accepting Bob's offer, so the risk is minimal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm still aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible, so I'm meeting Bob halfway.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation open.
* **Clear reason:** I've provided a reason for my counter-offer (meeting in the middle) which makes it more persuasive.
* **Open to discussion:**  I've asked Bob for his thoughts, which keeps the dialogue open and gives him room to potentially counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $8,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still within reach of a better deal. I have three rounds left before I have to consider selling to John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,600?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This strategy has been successful so far, and I'm hoping it will continue to work.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, which might encourage him to come up slightly in price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us to keep the negotiation positive.

This counteroffer continues to move towards my desired price while remaining reasonable for Bob.  We're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,600 is still a bit above my target. How about we meet at $8,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob's final offer of $8,000 is the same as John's offer.  Since I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000. This guarantees me a sale and ensures I don't walk away with nothing."
