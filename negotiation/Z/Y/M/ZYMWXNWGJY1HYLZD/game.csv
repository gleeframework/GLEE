"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $125. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too. How about we meet at $122.50?",122.5,Alice,5,
