"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident you'll find the product well worth that price.",102.5,Alice,5,
