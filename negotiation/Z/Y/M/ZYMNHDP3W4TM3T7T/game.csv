"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1800000 is above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional asset. Let's try $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm ready to offer $1400000.  This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to consider the value I've attached to this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure it's worth at least $1700000 to me. Let's try $1600000 again, but I'm willing to meet you at $1550000 if you're willing to meet me halfway from your previous offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
