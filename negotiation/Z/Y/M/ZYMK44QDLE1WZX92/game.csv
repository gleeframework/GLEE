"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,500. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still a bit more reasonable for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
