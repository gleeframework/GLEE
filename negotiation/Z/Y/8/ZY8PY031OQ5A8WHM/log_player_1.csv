"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. This is a good starting point for negotiation. My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. 

It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value. This shows that I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a significant loss. I believe $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise point that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better offer. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob right now because I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good deal for both of us. If he doesn't accept, I'll sell the product to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  While I'm open to negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John. It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation with Bob, especially given the time constraint. I'm going to accept the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product to him."
