Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better to reject this offer and continue negotiating. You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel $85 would be a fair price for me. I hope we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been insistent on his $85 offer, and at this point, continuing to negotiate is unlikely to get you closer to your desired price.  Selling to John for $120 is the best option to ensure you meet your minimum acceptable price."
