"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I understand its importance to you and am offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable item at a discount. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as her offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product ($8,000). By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her to lower the price further."
