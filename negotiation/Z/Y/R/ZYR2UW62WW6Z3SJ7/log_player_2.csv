"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see its full potential. Let's split the difference. How about $900,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm ready to make a final concession.  How about $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget.  Let's seal the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $810,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's find common ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $830,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  This is my final offer.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $830,000.  You've made a strong effort to negotiate, but at this point, John's offer of $800,000 is the best deal. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
