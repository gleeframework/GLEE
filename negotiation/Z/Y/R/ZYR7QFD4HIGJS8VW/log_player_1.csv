Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
