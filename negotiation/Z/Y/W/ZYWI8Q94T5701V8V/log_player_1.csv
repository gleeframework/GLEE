"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob can make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm happy he's interested, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm aware that I can get $100 from John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets you this fantastic product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reiterating the product's value can reinforce the deal's attractiveness.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk further rounds with Bob and potentially miss out on a guaranteed sale to John.
* **John offers a secure deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
