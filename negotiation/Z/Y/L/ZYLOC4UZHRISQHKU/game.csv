"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $750,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
