"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than the original price.**  It's now $11,000, which is closer to Bob's preferred price range. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  Paying $15,000 is a significantly higher price than $11,000.
* **Further negotiation might be risky.**  Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, and further haggling might lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible option."
