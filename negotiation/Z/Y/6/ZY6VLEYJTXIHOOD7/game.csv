,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $145. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's make a deal!",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $152? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",152.0,Alice,5,
