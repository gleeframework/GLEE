Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your needs. Given its unique features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than its face value of $8,000. Considering the high quality and potential long-term value it could bring to you, I'd like to propose an initial offer of $12,000. This includes not only the product itself but also exclusive access to our VIP customer support services for the next year. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $12000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $8000, which is my maximum price point.  This would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
