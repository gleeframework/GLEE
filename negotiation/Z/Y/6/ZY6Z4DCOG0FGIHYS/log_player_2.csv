"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your needs. Given its unique features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than its face value of $8000. Considering the high quality and potential long-term value it could bring to you, I'd like to propose an initial offer of $12000. This includes not only the product itself but also exclusive access to our VIP customer support services for the next year. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's  worth exploring the negotiation process to see if Alice is willing to come down in price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $8,000, which is my maximum price point.  This would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently."", ""product_price"": 8000}
