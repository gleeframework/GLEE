"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing  $1,100,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $975,000 is closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). We're aiming to close a deal above the $1,000,000 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $975,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both are trying to find a reasonable point here.  To close this out today, how about $1,000,000 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk he won't go higher. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the possibility of losing him as a buyer."
