"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $10500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. How about we try $9800? I'm thinking we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be realistic about my budget. How about we try $10500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,6,
