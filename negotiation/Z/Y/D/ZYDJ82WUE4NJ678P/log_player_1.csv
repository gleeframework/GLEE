Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible without going below our own minimum of $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale.
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and allows us to move on to other opportunities. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, we aim to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
