Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my limit. I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely she'll go lower than $150. It's time to go with the safer option and buy from John for $100."
