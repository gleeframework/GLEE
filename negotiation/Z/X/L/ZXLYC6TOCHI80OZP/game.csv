"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit high for me. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $140. I'm feeling confident we can come to an agreement at this price.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $155? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",155.0,Alice,5,
