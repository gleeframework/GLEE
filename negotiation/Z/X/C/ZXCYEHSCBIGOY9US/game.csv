"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
