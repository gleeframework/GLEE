"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $14,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit far from that number. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
