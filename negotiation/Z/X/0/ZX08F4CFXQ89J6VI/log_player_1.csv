"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product at a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum. While it's tempting to accept, I have the potential to get a better price.
* **Negotiation Value:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. I can potentially push him to a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk of Bob walking away, the potential reward of a higher price justifies the risk.  

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's lowball. 
* **Signaling Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a value above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will give me a better idea of Bob's upper limit and how serious he is about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Bob has moved up from his initial $1,000,000 offer, showing some willingness to compromise.
* **Closing in:** While I would prefer more, $1,100,000 is a significant improvement over the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I continue to reject, there's a risk Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer. 

**Next Steps:** Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential for a stalemate or further negotiation that may not yield a better result."
