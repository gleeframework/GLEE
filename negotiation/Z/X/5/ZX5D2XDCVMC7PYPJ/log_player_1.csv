{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  This price reflects its quality and potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and see the value in the product. 
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the product's uniqueness and potential, subtly emphasizing its worth. 

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with in my counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price elsewhere. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $12,000 is above my floor of $10,000. This means I have room to negotiate further without selling to John.
* **Opportunity for a higher price:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer indicates his interest and willingness to pay more than the John's offer.
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a higher final sale price. 

I'll use the next round to counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal selling point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe this product is truly unique and offers a value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still reflects the product's quality and potential, but also acknowledges your interest. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  I'm reducing my price by $1,500, showing flexibility while maintaining a price point higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I reiterate the product's unique value and potential to justify the price.
* **Focus on compromise:** I frame the counteroffer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement, promoting a collaborative tone. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring a profit above my minimum. I'm aiming for a negotiation that satisfies both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's uniqueness and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12500. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $12,500 is only $500 below my previous offer and significantly above my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Significantly higher than John's offer:**  This offer is $2,500 higher than John's offer, ensuring a better profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there is a risk that Bob will walk away or further lower his offer. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit without risking a lower sale price.

Accepting this offer balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's a strategically sound decision that ensures a reasonable profit while minimizing potential losses."
