"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm confident I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Bob's counteroffer is too low, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still within a range that is fair for me. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. While it's lower than my initial goal, it's still above my minimum and worth accepting. It's important to remember that negotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial agreement, and I believe this is a good outcome."
