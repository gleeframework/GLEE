"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as you can potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,000."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit more, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
