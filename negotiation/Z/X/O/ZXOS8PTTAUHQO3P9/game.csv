"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $1,500.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value of $8,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
