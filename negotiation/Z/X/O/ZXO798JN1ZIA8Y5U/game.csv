"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to offer you a slight reduction, but I think $10,200 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I could potentially do $9,800.  Does that work for you?",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,800, which would be $9,950. What do you think?",9950.0,Alice,7,
