Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000.  While this is useful information, you don't want to base your offer solely on this.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to accept a lower price or stick with selling to John. 
* **""Special Price"" Psychology:**  Framing it as a ""special price"" might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal than he actually is. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have a pressing need to sell the product immediately. If you need the cash quickly, a price closer to John's offer might be more suitable."
