"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product and would be willing to pay $750000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my  budget, and I'm eager to finalize a deal. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This price is at my absolute maximum, but I'm sure it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000.
