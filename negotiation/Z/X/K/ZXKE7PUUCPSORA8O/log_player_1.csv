{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a little bit above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point for determining Bob's interest and potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price. You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup some of my investment. Would you be willing to pay $8,500 for the product? This is a good price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the need to recover your investment, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is within my financial limits. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear that he won't budge from $8,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's not worth the time and effort for a potentially small gain. John is offering the same price, so it's more efficient to simply sell to him and move on."
