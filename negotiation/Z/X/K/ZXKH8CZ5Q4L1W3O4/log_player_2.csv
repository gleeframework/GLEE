Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice is very unlikely to go much lower than $825,000. Continuing to negotiate could result in her raising the price or me having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting $825,000 secures a reasonable discount."
