Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'm also being optimistic and stating that the product is ""worth every penny"" to hopefully pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still a good starting point for negotiation. I'm not willing to accept his offer yet, as I believe there's potential to get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe there is more room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I will continue to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $1,000,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal right now."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're getting closer to my asking price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we settle on $990,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $985,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are down to the last few rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm starting to run out of time. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm worried he might end up rejecting my next counteroffer.  To avoid the risk of losing out on a guaranteed sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe and reasonable option."
