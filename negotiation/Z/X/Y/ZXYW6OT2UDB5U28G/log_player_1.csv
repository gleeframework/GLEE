"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leverage the potential value Bob sees in the product.  This gives him room to counteroffer, but also sets a clear starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can push for a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still staying within the range where I believe we can find common ground. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  The negotiation is still early and there's room to improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going for my minimum price here. With only 5 rounds left, I'm pushing to close the deal.  I believe Bob is motivated to buy and will likely accept this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the chance of reaching a deal with Bob at a price I'm happy with is diminishing. To avoid risking a worse outcome, I'll sell to John.  While I prefer to make a deal with Bob, securing a sale with John guarantees my minimum desired profit."
