Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her lowest price by stating ""This is the lowest I'm willing to go."" It's unlikely she'll go lower in future rounds.  Since $800,000 is a good price and well within your budget, it's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
