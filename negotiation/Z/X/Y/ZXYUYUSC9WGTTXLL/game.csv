"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
