Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going for the maximum right away. This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal, making him more likely to counteroffer.
* **The Value of John:** Knowing John's offer of $15,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my initial offer and counteroffers too low, I can walk away and still get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, there's still potential for a better deal. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, so I can use that as leverage to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? This gives you a great price and still ensures I can make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $11,000 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:**  Emphasizing that this is a ""great price"" makes it more appealing.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  Going too low could lead to a stalemate.  $11,000 is a more reasonable counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving."
