"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. That way, it's a win-win for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $127.50? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $126? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",126.0,Bob,6,
