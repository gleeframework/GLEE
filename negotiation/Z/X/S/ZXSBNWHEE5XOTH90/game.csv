"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $650,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to find common ground here. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $650,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",675000.0,Alice,5,
