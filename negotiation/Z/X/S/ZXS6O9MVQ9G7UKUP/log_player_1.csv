{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the value of the product. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe the product is worth more and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,500? It's a significant step down from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal. While I would ideally prefer more, I'm confident I can find a better deal with another buyer in the future.  It's important to recognize that this isn't a life-changing amount of money, and a guaranteed $12,500 is better than risking a lower offer or a failed negotiation."
