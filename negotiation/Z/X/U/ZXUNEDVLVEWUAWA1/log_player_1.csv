Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum selling price and your backup offer from John. This allows for a higher potential profit.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,300,000 is a strong starting point for negotiation. It's closer to Bob's perceived value while still providing you a significant profit margin.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob's feedback, signaling a willingness to discuss the price further, which could lead to an even better deal. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a reasonable estimate of Bob's valuation. If you're unsure, starting slightly lower and gauging his reaction might be prudent."
