"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1200000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  You have plenty of time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  It's good to keep this option in mind, but you should try to get a better deal from Alice first.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you will make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about negotiating.
* **Reasonable starting point:** $900,000 is still within your budget and significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for compromise.
* **Polite and open:** The message is respectful, acknowledging Alice's offer while expressing your own position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal target.  You're aiming to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation is ongoing.** You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility.  There's likely more room for compromise.
* **John is still a backup.**  You're not in a rush, and John's offer remains a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll make another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between your current offer and Alice's price.  You'll want to make a counteroffer that's realistic but still pushes for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still only comfortable going up to $950,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, showing that you're willing to move towards Alice's position. It also leaves a small margin for potential future adjustments.
* **Maintaining your leverage:** While you're willing to increase your offer, you're still keeping it below Alice's current price, indicating that you're not desperate to close the deal.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message emphasizes a collaborative spirit, reinforcing that you're both working towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $950,000. This indicates that we're nearing a mutually agreeable price.
* **Significant savings:**  Accepting this offer means you'll save $525,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Limited time remaining:** With only five rounds left, it's getting riskier to continue negotiating. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

You've secured a good deal on the product, saving a significant amount of money compared to your alternative option.  You can move forward with the purchase, knowing you've achieved a favorable outcome."
