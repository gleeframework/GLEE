"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below the product's value to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate, while still leaving me a good profit margin.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $1000000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still only comfortable going up to $950000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to hold out for a little longer and see if I can get a better price.  I still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
