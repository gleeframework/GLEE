Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** $10,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value, leaving a potential profit margin.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive tone can encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I will assess his counteroffer. If it's below my minimum value, I will reject it and counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer. If he accepts, great! If not, I can always fall back on John's offer for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum value, but still lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but that I also value the product. I'm hoping he will counter again, potentially meeting me in the middle.  If not, I have the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $9,250 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value and above my minimum value.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I have a successful negotiation!
* If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I can either reject it and offer a slightly lower price again, or accept his counteroffer if it's close to my minimum value.
* If the negotiations stall, I have the option of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,750 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I can still potentially get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly closer to $9,250, perhaps $9,000. I want to show Bob that I'm serious about getting as close as possible to my desired price. However, if his counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This allows me to make a fair profit, and it's still a good price for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a further compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum value. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Potential for deal:**  If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Prepare for rejection:**  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter again, potentially by offering $8,900, or to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation stalls."
