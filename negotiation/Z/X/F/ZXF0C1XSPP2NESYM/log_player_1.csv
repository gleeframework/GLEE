Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and other potential buyers (""interest I've had""), subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style. If you know he's very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be better.
* **Relationship:**  If you value a long-term relationship with Bob, a less aggressive starting price might be more appropriate."
