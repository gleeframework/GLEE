"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My starting offer is $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 950000}
