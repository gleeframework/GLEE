"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $18000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close on the product today.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you at $13000. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
