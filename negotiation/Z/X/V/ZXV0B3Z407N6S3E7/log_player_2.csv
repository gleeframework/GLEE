Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. It's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

You're still within your budget, but there's room to negotiate.  You can try to get the price down further, or you might consider buying from John if Alice isn't willing to budge much more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,750. Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $10750 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10875?  This would be a fair compromise, and I think you'll be very satisfied with the product.  Let's try to close this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
