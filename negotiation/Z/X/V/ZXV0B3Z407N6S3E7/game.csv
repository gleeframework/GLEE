"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. It's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit above my target. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10750. Let's try to reach a compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $10750 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10875?  This would be a fair compromise, and I think you'll be very satisfied with the product.  Let's try to close this out.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm really close to my limit, but I can go up to $10800. This is a fair price considering the product, and I hope we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Bob,6,
