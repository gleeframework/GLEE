Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant gain if accepted. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning a time-sensitive offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from stalling or trying to lowball you further.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have a backup buyer, it's not explicitly mentioned in the message. This allows you to maintain a stronger negotiating position with Bob. He doesn't need to know about John unless negotiations falter."
