"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Even though Alice claims the offer is fair, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **John's price is known:** You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:** You can likely negotiate a lower price with John, or at least get a better deal than Alice's offer.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and exploring options with John is the better strategy."
