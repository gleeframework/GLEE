``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price of $15,000.  It's important to remember that Bob is interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would give you a great deal on the product and would still allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with $13,250.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm starting to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $13,250 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,400. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13400}
``` 

I'm trying to stay firm on my desired price range while still offering a concession. This demonstrates flexibility and keeps the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,200?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although $13,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get him to come up just a bit more. I still have a few rounds left and selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,200 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with $13,300. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 13300} 
```

I'm setting a firm price and letting Bob know this is my final offer. This adds pressure and increases the possibility of Bob accepting. I'm also reminding him that I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. How about $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're down to the wire, and while Bob's offer is close, it's still below my minimum. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
