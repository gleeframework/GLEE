"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would give you a great deal on the product and would still allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $13,250 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,400. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price. Let me know if you're interested.",13400.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,200?",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,200 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with $13,300. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",13300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. How about $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,8,
