"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value the product at the same amount and I'm able to get a slightly higher price than my guaranteed sale. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
