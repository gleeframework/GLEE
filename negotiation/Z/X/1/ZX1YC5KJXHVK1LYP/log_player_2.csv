"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get it for closer to $85.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his own valuation as possible.  He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while setting a clear expectation of the price range he's aiming for."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $85. While Alice's offer of $92.50 is better than her previous offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping for a price a little closer to my initial offer.  How about $90? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to push for a lower price, but he's also demonstrating his willingness to compromise. By offering $90, Bob is moving closer to Alice's latest offer, showing that he's taking her counteroffer seriously. This helps to keep the negotiation moving forward and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
