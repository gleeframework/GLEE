"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get it for closer to $85.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping for a price a little closer to my initial offer.  How about $90? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
