"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and $11,500 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject another counteroffer and Bob will have to pay John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this scenario."
