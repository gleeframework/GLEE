"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
