,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm offering the product for $15,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $12,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, I'm ready to close the deal now. ",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000.  This is truly my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal now. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,7,
