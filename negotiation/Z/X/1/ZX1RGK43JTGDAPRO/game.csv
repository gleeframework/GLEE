"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. While I understand its worth to you, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
