Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference at $14000? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.
