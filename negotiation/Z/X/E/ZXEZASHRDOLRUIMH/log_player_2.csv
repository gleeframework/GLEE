"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let you have it for $20,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $15,000, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is overpriced at $20,000. You know you can get the product for its true value of $15,000 from John.  There's no reason to overpay."
