"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that aligns with your interests. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product is interesting, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with the $900,000 offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not there yet.  $1,050,000 is a bit high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This represents a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and its value to me.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
