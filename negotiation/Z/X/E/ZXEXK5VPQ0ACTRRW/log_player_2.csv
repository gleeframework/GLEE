"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I want to see how low Alice is willing to go. By starting significantly below my actual maximum, there's room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  I maintain a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Leaving Alice Room:** This offer is low enough to make Alice consider a counteroffer, but not so low as to be insulting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:**  I'm willing to go up to my maximum price ($100) since it seems Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating it's my final offer, I signal that I'm serious but still open to this deal. 
* **Pressure Point:** This puts the decision squarely in Alice's court. She can either accept my best offer or risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $100, Bob. I think it's worth more than that. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $115. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $115. 
* **Reached My Limit:** I'm not willing to exceed my $100 budget.
* **John is Reliable:** I have a guaranteed option with John at my desired price.

It's better to secure the product at my price point with John than to continue negotiating with Alice, who is unlikely to budge further."
