{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal considering the initial price was $1,200,000 and Bob still has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product."
