Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
