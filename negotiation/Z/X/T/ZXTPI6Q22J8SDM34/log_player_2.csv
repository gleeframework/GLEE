Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $775,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for something a little higher. How about $825,000? That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen!

It's time to cut bait with Alice.  She's unlikely to go below $800,000 and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  There's no point in risking further negotiation when you have a sure thing that meets your needs."
