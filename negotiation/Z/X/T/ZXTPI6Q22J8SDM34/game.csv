"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $775,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for something a little higher. How about $825,000? That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,7,
