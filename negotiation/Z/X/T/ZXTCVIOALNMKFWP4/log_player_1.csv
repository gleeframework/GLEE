```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm counteroffering with $975,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

I'm counteroffering with $925,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair considering Bob's initial offer of $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
