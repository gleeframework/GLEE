"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe is worth a significant amount to you. My asking price is $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can use the threat of buying from John as leverage."

This is a serious offer and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $900,000 is far below the product's actual value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation and potentially using the threat of buying from John as leverage."
