{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe is worth a significant amount to you. My asking price is $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer aims to start the negotiation by leaving some room for a potential counteroffer while still securing a decent profit for myself. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in this product, and I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary. However, I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your asking price is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. This is a serious offer and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $900,000 is far below the product's actual value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. However, I'm very interested in this product and am willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering John's offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below what I consider a fair price. While I value a deal with him, I'm not willing to drop much further.  John's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
