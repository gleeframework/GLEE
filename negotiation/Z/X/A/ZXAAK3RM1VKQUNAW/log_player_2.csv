(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You have leverage because you can always buy from John.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also willing to pay significantly less than her asking price. This leaves room for compromise while still staying within your budget."
