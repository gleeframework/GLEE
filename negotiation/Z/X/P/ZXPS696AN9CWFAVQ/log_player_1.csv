"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive and encouraging message sets the stage for a productive negotiation. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** The price is high enough that Bob has incentive to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually acceptable price. 

**Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. If things don't look promising, I'll move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer to my desired range, it's still too low to accept in the early stages of negotiation. 
* **I have 9 rounds remaining.** This gives me room to push for a better price. 
* **John is a secure option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim for a price that's still attractive to Bob, but more advantageous for me. I'll keep the possibility of selling to John in mind as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's real value, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm framing this offer as a compromise to encourage further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy depending on how many rounds are left. I'll consider:
* **Lowering the Price:**  If time is running out, I may need to lower the price further.
* **Selling to John:**  If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'll consider selling to John. 

I'm aiming for a win-win situation, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still only willing to pay up to $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, it's not yet a profitable deal for me.
* **Time is on my side:** We've only had 4 rounds, and I have 6 remaining. This gives me more room to negotiate and potentially reach a better price.
* **John is a safe fallback:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to find a compromise. If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'll seriously consider selling to John as the rounds dwindle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to drop to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen! "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Fair compromise:** I'm framing it as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to come up a bit more.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Building urgency:**  By saying ""Let's make this deal happen!"" I'm hinting that I'm not willing to continue negotiations indefinitely. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully assess the situation:

* **Lower the price slightly:**  I might lower the price to $9,800 in the next round.
* **Consider selling to John:** If the rounds start to run out and Bob is still unwilling to budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John. 

I'm still aiming for a win-win, but I'm ready to make a strategic decision based on the remaining rounds and Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am still only willing to pay up to $9,750. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's getting closer, but not enough to make it a good deal for me.
* **Only 4 rounds left:** We are approaching the middle of the negotiation. While time is running out, I still have a few rounds to leverage and potentially get a better offer.
* **John is a safe option:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to find a compromise. If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I will seriously consider selling to John.  I need to start getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,875. This price recognizes the value we've both discussed, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the Gap:**  I'm reducing the gap between our offers significantly, showing a commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  The offer is framed as a ""meet you halfway"" gesture to encourage Bob to see it as a win.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The price is still above Bob's offer, reflecting the product's worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll assess if selling to John is the best option, especially with fewer rounds remaining. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer accordingly, always keeping my minimum price in mind. 
* **Urgency is Rising:**  I'll start incorporating subtle hints of urgency in my messages to encourage Bob to act."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am still only willing to pay up to $9,700. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob is slim.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,700 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John is the safe bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**It's not ideal to walk away from a potential deal, but given the circumstances, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision.**"
