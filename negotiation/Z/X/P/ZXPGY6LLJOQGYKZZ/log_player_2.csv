Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on the profit margin I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $10,500 secures a good price for you and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
