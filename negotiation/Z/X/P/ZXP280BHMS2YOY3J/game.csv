"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
