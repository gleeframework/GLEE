I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) to see if I can get closer to Bob's value ($8,000). I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and show I'm open to negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
