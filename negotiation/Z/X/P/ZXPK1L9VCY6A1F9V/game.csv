"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  While I can't go as low as $7,500, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
