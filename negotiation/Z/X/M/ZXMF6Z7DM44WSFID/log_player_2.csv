$12,000 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

$9,500 is still too high.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to pay $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
