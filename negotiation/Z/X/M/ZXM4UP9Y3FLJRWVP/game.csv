"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a steal! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $12,000 for the product. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still making a profit.",13500.0,Alice,5,
