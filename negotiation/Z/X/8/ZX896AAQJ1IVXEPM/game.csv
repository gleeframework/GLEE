"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $13000? It's a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $11500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
