"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to work with you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
