"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150.  This allows room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit if Bob accepts.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to my minimum price than Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject it. I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars before accepting.  The risk of losing the sale to Bob is outweighed by the potential to earn closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not willing to go lower.  It's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, Bob will see that."
