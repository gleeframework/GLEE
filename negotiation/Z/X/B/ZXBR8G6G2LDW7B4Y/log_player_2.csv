"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think you'll really benefit from having this product, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her product valuation, it's still more than you need to spend. You know John will sell you the same product for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $1,500 and achieve your goal."
