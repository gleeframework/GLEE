"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. Alice's offer is above your maximum budget, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget. You should continue to try and negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you are serious about buying the product, but you are still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,570,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum budget, even though it is the closest to your desired price so far. Since you have the option to buy from John at your maximum budget, it makes more sense to secure the product at that price rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
