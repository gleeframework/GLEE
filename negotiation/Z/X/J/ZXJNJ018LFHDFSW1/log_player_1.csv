Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so he has room to negotiate up to $2,000 before it's no longer a good deal for him.
* **It shows you're confident in the value of the product:** By starting high, you demonstrate that you believe the product is worth a lot, which can make Bob more likely to take your offer seriously.

However, keep in mind this is just a starting point, and your strategy should adapt based on how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still below your initial offer and there's a good chance you can get closer to your desired price. 

* **You have leverage:** Bob has already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired $10,000.

By rejecting the offer, you maintain your position and can potentially get a better deal without losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Demonstrating flexibility:** It shows that you're willing to negotiate, but also that you're not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Strong argument:**  The message highlights the value of the product to justify the price.

This counteroffer positions you to potentially secure a deal closer to your initial goal while still remaining competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is only $200 away from your minimum acceptable price of $8,600.  

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  This offer provides a secure sale with a profit. 

While you may be able to potentially squeeze out a few hundred more dollars, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and minimizes potential losses."
