"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10,000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested in securing it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal, there's potential to get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original price, while allowing us to maintain a fair value for our offering. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. Buying from John would cost $10,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000. It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
