I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  I've reached the point where I'm not confident that I can get Bob to come up to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether. John is a guaranteed buyer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal considering the circumstances."
