"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $11,200 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $11,200. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product.",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,900 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,050? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",11050.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,050. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,200, so I'll offer $10,700 for the product.",10700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,700. How about we split the difference one last time and go with $10,850?  I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",10850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product, which is still a bit lower than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",10750.0,Bob,8,
