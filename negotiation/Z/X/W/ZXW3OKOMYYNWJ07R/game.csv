"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and while it's closer to what I can afford, I still need to stick to my budget.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're trying to stay within a certain range.  However, I can't go as low as $1,200,000. My final offer is $1,240,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial ask, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.",1240000.0,Alice,5,
