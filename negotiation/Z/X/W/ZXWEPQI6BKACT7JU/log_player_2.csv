"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still above Bob's ideal price but within his budget. This is a reasonable compromise considering that Alice initially offered $900,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget and avoiding further negotiation."
