"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal since it's below your maximum budget of $80. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a lower price, and John's offer is higher. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable discount."
