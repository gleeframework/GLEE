Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $200. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150. It makes the most sense to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation."
