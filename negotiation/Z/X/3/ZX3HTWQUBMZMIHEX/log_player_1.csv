Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that reflects the product's value to me. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and shows a willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can secure a higher price with continued negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd like to get even more, I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether.  With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to accept his offer to secure the sale."
