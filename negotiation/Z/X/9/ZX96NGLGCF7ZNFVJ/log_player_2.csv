"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by many of our customers. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. For this exceptional item, I am proposing a price of $95. This is a special offer considering its true worth, and I hope it aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  She's trying to inflate the perceived value to justify a price of $95. You know you can get it for $100 from John.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and might encourage her to come down in price. 

You'll wait to see if Alice makes a better offer before resorting to buying from John."
