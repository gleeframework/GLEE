Bob's offer is much lower than my initial offer, but still represents a significant gain for me.  However, I'm willing to push for more. I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profit margin.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a substantial gain compared to selling to John.  I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
