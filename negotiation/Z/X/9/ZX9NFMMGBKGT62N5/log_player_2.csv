It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You have a clear upper limit of $1,200,000 you're willing to pay."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and gives us room to negotiate.  It's important to be aggressive early on to see if we can get a better deal."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay from John.  I'll reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is still below Alice's current offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, she'll see this as a good middle ground and accept."
