``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if he counters. I also haven't gone too high, as I don't want to risk him rejecting outright and losing the chance for a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm motivated to sell, I can do better than $1,100,000.  I'll counter and try to squeeze out a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to his range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still holding firm on a price that's better than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to his initial offer, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a much better price, so I'll take the safer option and sell to him."
