"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  I'm really hoping to get a good deal on this product.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and go with $106.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident I'll love the product!",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $106 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $108? It's a great price for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
