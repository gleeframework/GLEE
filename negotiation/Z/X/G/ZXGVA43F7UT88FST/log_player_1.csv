Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but not so high as to scare Bob off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's a good middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John guarantees me $800,000 which is a good outcome.  I'll choose to sell to John."
