Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can go higher if Bob rejects your initial offer. 

By starting with this offer, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me.  How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired price range. It's best to reject Bob's counteroffer and continue negotiating. By rejecting, you demonstrate your determination to get a better price and encourage Bob to improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a great deal for both of us, so let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $90 even?  That's a fair price and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $80 and is within a reasonable range of my desired price.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a decent profit without risking losing the sale altogether."
