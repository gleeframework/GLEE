"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice.  $100 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me.  How about $85?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* We want to start with a counteroffer significantly below Alice's initial price to signal our willingness to negotiate.
*  $85 puts us in a good position to potentially meet in the middle, closer to a price that benefits us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a great deal for both of us, so let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but $92.50 is still a bit high. We're getting closer to a price that works, but we have room to push a little further without risking losing the deal to John's $120 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $90 even?  That's a fair price and we can both walk away happy."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* We are getting close to our maximum budget, so we need to be more conservative.
* Offering $90 shows Alice we're willing to compromise but still want a price closer to our target.  
* It's a strong offer and gives us a good chance to secure the deal at a price well below John's."
