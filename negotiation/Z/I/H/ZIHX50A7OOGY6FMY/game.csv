"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. I think this price is a fair reflection of its value and will allow us to finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is fair, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
