"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It leaves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $60, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still too high. We should continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, indicating we're serious about a deal.
* **Sets a firm boundary:** ""Final offer"" suggests we're not budging much further, adding pressure.
* **Stays below our limit:**  $75 leaves us with some savings compared to John's offer.

This approach aims to secure the best possible price without dragging out the negotiation endlessly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Her final offer of $85 is more than we're willing to pay when we have the option to buy from John for $80. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
