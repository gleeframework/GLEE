"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to buy it for $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $7500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8250.  What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to go to $8000, which is my absolute maximum.  If that works for you, let's close the deal!",8000.0,Bob,4,
