"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. My asking price is $9000, which I think is a fair reflection of its quality and potential benefits.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $7500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8250.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,250 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's willing to pay up to $8,000 and there are still more rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to go to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If that works for you, let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
