"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to at least receive $1,050,000 for this product.  This price still offers you a significant value compared to your alternative options.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for both of us.  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John for $1,200,000, making less profit."
