"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you will be significant.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Opening with a high price establishes a starting point that allows for negotiation. 
* **Framing the value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value and potential benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** $1,000,000 is a considerable amount, leaving room for Bob to make counteroffers and for me to negotiate. 

**Important Note:**  I will continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the progress of the negotiation. If Bob rejects my offer and makes a counteroffer that's below my minimum acceptable value, I will consider selling to John for $800,000 to avoid losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but still too low.**  $900,000 is only $100,000 below my initial offer.
* **Negotiation is key:**  I believe there's room for a more favorable price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have 8 rounds left to reach a deal.  
* **John is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a satisfactory agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer. I want to be firm but also open to finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit below my value for it.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to see if we can reach a deal.  This price reflects the unique value and potential it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000), demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justifying the price:** I've emphasized the ""unique value and potential"" the product holds for Bob to encourage him to see the worth in the proposed price.
* **Open communication:** My message invites further discussion and encourages Bob to respond.

**Important Note:** I'm aiming for a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties.  If Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer, I'll need to evaluate if I want to risk losing more time with further negotiations or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $30,000 below my last counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation could potentially result in a higher price, but it also risks losing time and potentially a deal altogether. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a relatively good price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I were to reject Bob's offer, I could still sell to John for $800,000, but that would be a significantly lower price.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the potential risk of continued negotiation and the value of a quick sale, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
