"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident its value is higher than $9,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to pay $9,750. Can you consider this offer?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
