Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to sell, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get a better counter-offer from him before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident its value is higher than $9,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
