Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's clear it's going to be a long negotiation to get significantly above his current offer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safest option to ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
