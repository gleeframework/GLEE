"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $95. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll get good use out of this product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $107.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal considering the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",107.5,Alice,5,
