"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to $12,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $12,500. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still too high. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely you'll reach your desired price point. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John for $12,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
