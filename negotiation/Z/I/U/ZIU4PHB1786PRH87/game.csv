"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's a price that represents a fair value for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
