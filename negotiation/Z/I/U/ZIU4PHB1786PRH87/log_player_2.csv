# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm starting to run out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out completely. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John at my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This ensures I get the product without risking further negotiation with Alice."
