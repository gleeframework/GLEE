"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500?  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit more than I had budgeted for. Would you consider $7,200? I think that's a fair compromise.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,800? This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent, I've also found a similar product for $8,000. To make a deal work for me, I'd need to be closer to $7,400.  What do you say?",7400.0,Bob,6,
