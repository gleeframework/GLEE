Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John if Bob doesn't accept my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see where the negotiation goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for a profitable deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could counter again, it seems like the negotiations aren't going well.  To guarantee my minimum value, I'll take the offer from John."
