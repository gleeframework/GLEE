"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it holds, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, $1,900,000 is closer to my original expectations for this product.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
