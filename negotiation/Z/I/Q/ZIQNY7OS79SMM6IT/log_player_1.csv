"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.  This shows I'm confident in the product's worth and aiming for a good profit, while leaving space for Bob to feel he can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm not ready to accept it yet, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in too easily.  I believe this price is still fair and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, with only 6 rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a significantly higher price, especially considering John is willing to buy for $1,200,000.  It's time to secure the sale."
