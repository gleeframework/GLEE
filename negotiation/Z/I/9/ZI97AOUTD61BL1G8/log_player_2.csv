"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,250,000.  It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay and more importantly, more than John's offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, saving you $250,000."
