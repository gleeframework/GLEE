"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8100?",8100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $8150, which is getting close to my minimum price. I'm not sure how much more I can bend, but I'm willing to hear you out.",8150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8100, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $8100?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8100 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8150 and $8100. How about $8125? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's the best we can do.",8125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $8125 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $8100, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Would you be willing to consider $8080?",8080.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $8080. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $8110? It's my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",8110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a very final offer of $7500. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying from Jhon for $8000.",7500.0,Bob,10,
