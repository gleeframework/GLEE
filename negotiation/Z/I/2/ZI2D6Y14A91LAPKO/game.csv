"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at no less than $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's potential. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $1750000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and within my budget.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is still too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1625000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
