"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11000? This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget with $11000. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
