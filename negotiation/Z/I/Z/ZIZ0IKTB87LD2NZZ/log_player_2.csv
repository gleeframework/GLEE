"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.  We want to aim for a price closer to $8,000, which is Alice's perceived value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still negotiate further. We'll reject this offer and propose a slightly higher counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

We are moving closer to a potential agreement. This counter-offer shows Alice that we are willing to negotiate, but we are still holding firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm eager to work something out, I can't go as low as $10,500. How about we settle at $11,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is a good deal for us. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and $11,000 is a reasonable price, saving us $4,000 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal."
