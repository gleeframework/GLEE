"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $100, which is still $20 more than what it's worth to Alice.
* **Strategy:** Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer gives him the opportunity to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:**  $90 is a reasonable starting point. It's still $10 more than what the product is worth to Alice, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Strategy:**  A smaller counteroffer may increase the likelihood that Alice accepts, and it gives Bob some room to negotiate further in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $95, which is still $15 more than what it's worth to Alice. 
* **Strategy:**  Bob should continue negotiating. While $95 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still get a lower price.  Rejecting and countering again shows Alice he's serious about getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there. How about $92? It's a good price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:** $92 is a reasonable offer, still giving Alice a profit while also being closer to Bob's desired price.  
* **Strategy:**  By sticking to his counteroffers and showing a willingness to negotiate, Bob increases the chances of securing a good deal while avoiding the $120 price from John."
