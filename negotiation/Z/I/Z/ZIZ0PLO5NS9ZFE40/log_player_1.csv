"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some room for negotiation and gives me a starting point to potentially earn more than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm also being positive and framing the offer as a beneficial one for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up on his offer. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product and I am willing to pay $13,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price. I have several more rounds to go, and I don't want to settle for less than $15,000 if I can avoid it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your offer, $13,000 is still a little too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already meeting you halfway.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm continuing to show flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm also trying to push Bob closer to my desired price point. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting that this is a final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility and I am willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $14,250.  This is a really good price considering the value of the product, and it shows my commitment to working with you.  I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

I'm continuing to be flexible by offering a slight price reduction, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fact that I'm making a significant effort to close the deal. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept my offer, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. I am willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and within our agreed range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my desired price with Bob, it seems he is unwilling to go higher. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000. It's better to secure the sale with John now rather than continue negotiating with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
