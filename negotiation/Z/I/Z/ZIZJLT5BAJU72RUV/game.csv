"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,92.0
"I'm not sure $97.50 is the right price for me, but I'm willing to pay a bit more. How about we meet at $92? It's a bit closer to the original price, but I think it's a fair price for me.",92.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer you the product for $95.  That way we both get something we're happy with.",95.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,92.0
"I've made a firm offer of $92, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120",92.0,Bob,6,,
