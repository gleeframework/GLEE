Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $150 is significantly more than your minimum price of $100, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:**  You don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price right away.
* **It includes a friendly message:**  This helps build rapport and makes the offer feel more personal.

Remember, you can adjust the price and message depending on your assessment of Bob's likely interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to get a bit more from Bob.  He's shown interest, and you've already established a baseline price.  Rejecting his offer gives you an opportunity to counter and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer of $100, and it's not too far off from your previous counteroffer of $125.  It's a good deal for both of you, and accepting it will avoid any further negotiation."
