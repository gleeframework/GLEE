"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value for the product. He can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $9,000, which is still above Bob's ideal value but closer to his maximum budget of $10,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and Bob can save $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision in this round."
