"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $145? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",145.0,Bob,4,
