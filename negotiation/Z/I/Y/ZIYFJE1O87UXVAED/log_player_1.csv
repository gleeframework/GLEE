Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000, as that's what I can get from John.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to gain a substantial value ($50,000) compared to his maximum price. 

This offer maximizes my potential earnings while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
