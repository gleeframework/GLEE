"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
