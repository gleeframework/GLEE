"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and benefits of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate and make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my profit while also considering the risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate that he is willing to negotiate.  
* **Exploring other options:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will need to carefully consider my counteroffer. I want to be realistic about Bob's likely willingness to pay, but I also want to maintain my goal of getting as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating that the product is valuable and that the price reflects its worth.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer again. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price that is as close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 as possible, while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $1,000,000, as I can always sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement at this point. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While Bob seems persistent, I'm not convinced that he will budge much further.
* **Assessing the risk:**  I need to weigh the potential of getting a better price in the remaining rounds against the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be more aggressive in my price point. I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and not risking losing the deal altogether. I'll also start to consider the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't budge."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but we're still too far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a final offer, and it reflects the value you'll gain from the product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a price close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value proposition:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he will receive.
* **Win-win situation:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial to both of us, promoting a sense of cooperation.

**Strategy:**

I'm making a more aggressive counteroffer, taking into account Bob's persistence and the dwindling number of rounds. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer.  

I'm also increasing the pressure by calling this my ""final offer,"" hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. However, I'm prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John, as the deal with John guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited time remaining:**  With only four rounds left, the time pressure is increasing.
* **Risk assessment:** I need to weigh the potential of getting a better price in the remaining rounds against the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  The risk of losing the deal with Bob is becoming more significant.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be more cautious and realistic. I'll aim for a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, recognizing that further negotiation might be difficult.  I'll also carefully consider the possibility of selling to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final concession:**  I'm presenting this as my final concession, signifying that I'm reaching the end of my negotiation room. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Moderate increase:** I'm only increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still holding my ground on a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Win-win framing:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win nature of the offer, highlighting that it's a fair price for both parties.
* **Call to action:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal, making it clear that I'm ready to move forward.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal to Bob is increasing. This offer represents a compromise, aiming to secure a price that's as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible while considering the potential for a counteroffer or a decision to sell to John.

I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer, as I can still sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
