It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds and a good starting point with Alice's offer."

This is a good deal for you as it saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely you won't get a better offer from Alice, and you have already lost two rounds."
