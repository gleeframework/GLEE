Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$85 offer:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum but still likely within Bob's budget, given the product is worth $80 to him.
* **Friendly message:**  Starting with a positive message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate further. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's $80 offer in mind as my safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I can always sell to John.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $85 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in the product though, how about $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $80?  That's fair to both of us, and gets this great product into your hands."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $80, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive Message:** The message focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution and highlights the value of the product for Bob.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and avoids unnecessary jargon or complex negotiations."
