"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already trying to get the product for its lowest acceptable value to me. This means it's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I'd risk getting even less in further rounds. John guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
