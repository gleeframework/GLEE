"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is more than I'm willing to spend right now. Given the value I'm looking for, I can offer $10000. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. How about we meet at $12500? This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11000. It's a fair offer, considering my budget and your need to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
