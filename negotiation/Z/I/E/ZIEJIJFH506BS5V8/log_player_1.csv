I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $12,500. This is still above my minimum acceptable price and shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm confident I can get closer to my original asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer is a safe bet that will get me the minimum I need."
