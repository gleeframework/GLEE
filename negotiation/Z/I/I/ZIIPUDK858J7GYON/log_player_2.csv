"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is way above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still above his maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I need to prioritize getting the best deal for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $950,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has the option to buy from John for $800,000, so he doesn't need to settle for a price that is significantly above his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget and she's not budging much. At this point, it's wiser to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
