"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,012,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,020,000. This is a final offer - I'm confident you won't find a better deal for this kind of value.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're confident in the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to go up to $1,015,000, but no higher. This is my final offer.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
