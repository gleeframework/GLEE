"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both John's price and Alice's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you'd like to pay $8,500, but I'm not sure that's enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. How about we discuss $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still significantly above her perceived value of the product. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $9,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

Here's why this counter offer makes sense:

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're standing firm at a price that's still a good deal for us, but we're also signaling that we're serious about buying.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  Putting a bit of time pressure on Alice might encourage her to accept. 
* **Alternative:** We still have the option of going to John if needed, so we're not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $9,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit more for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, but we're running out of rounds. It's time to signal we're serious about our walk-away price and John's offer is looking more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $9,000 is my absolute limit.  I'm ready to make this deal happen right now, but if we can't agree, I'll have to go with a different seller."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Ultimatum:** This counteroffer serves as an ultimatum. We're reiterating our previous offer and making it clear this is our final price.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning other sellers and our readiness to close, we're increasing the time pressure on Alice. 
* **Walk Away Point:**  We're signaling that we're willing to walk away from the deal if our price isn't met. This reinforces our position and the seriousness of our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a better price for this product. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about we meet at $9,500? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's worth it for this product. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown she's unwilling to budge significantly from her $9,500 offer.  We've been firm and clear about our $9,000 limit. 

At this point, we've maximized our negotiating position with Alice. Continuing is unlikely to result in us getting a price we're happy with. Buying from John for $12,000, while not ideal, prevents us from potentially overpaying in a drawn-out negotiation."
