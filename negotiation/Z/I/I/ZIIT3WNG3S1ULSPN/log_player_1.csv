"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This is a common negotiation tactic to establish a high starting point and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm offering a price that's above my minimum, leaving room to compromise if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Strategic Choice:**  I'm willing to go slightly above my minimum price to try and secure a deal quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to strategize based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm initially focusing on Bob, I'm always aware of John's $1,500,000 offer as a fallback option."

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll carefully consider my counteroffer. I'll need to factor in:

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  Is he willing to negotiate further, or is this his final offer?
* **Remaining Rounds:** How many rounds do I have left before I need to make a decision?
* **My Risk Tolerance:** How much am I willing to risk not reaching an agreement with Bob?"
