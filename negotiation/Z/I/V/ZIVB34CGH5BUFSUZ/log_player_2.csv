It's too early to say if $500,000 is a good price. Let's see if we can get a better deal by counter-offering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start by making a bold counteroffer.  $250,000 is a significant discount, and it will give us a good starting point for negotiation."

$400,000 is still a bit high. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial counteroffer before considering buying from John."

I'll try to meet Alice halfway with a counteroffer of $300,000. This shows I'm serious about buying, but still want a good deal."
