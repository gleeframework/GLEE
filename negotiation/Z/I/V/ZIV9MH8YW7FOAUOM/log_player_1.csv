"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it for $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's features, $12,500 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000? I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also respecting my budget. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable price, his ""final offer"" of $9,500 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $10,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation rounds when I have a guaranteed sale at a better price."
