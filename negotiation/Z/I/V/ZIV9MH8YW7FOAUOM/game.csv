"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's features, $12,500 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000? I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also respecting my budget. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
