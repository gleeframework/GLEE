"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $100. I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $102. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
