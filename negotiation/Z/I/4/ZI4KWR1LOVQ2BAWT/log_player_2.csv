"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to negotiate. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's still room to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I can go without compromising my own profit margins. I believe this price still reflects the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price:** Alice has lowered the price to $11,200, which is only $200 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $10,500.
* **It's likely Alice won't go lower:**  Alice has stated this is her final concession, so it's unlikely she'll drop the price further.
* **Buying from John is significantly more expensive:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is a much worse deal than accepting Alice's offer for $11,200. 

**Conclusion:** It makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase at $11,200.  While he may have been able to squeeze out an extra $200, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too significant."
