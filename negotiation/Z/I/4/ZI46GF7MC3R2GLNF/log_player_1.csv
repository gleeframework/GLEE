Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's potential for him to counter and for you to reach a price closer to his valuation.
* **It's not too aggressive:** If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $8,000."
