"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy from John to maximize your savings."
