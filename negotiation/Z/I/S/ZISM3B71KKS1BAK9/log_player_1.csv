Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price and slightly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message frames the price as a ""special deal,"" potentially influencing Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
