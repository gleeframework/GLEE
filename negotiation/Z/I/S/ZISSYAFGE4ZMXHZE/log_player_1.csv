Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's value of $800,000, but lower than your value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  

It's also important to note that you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives you leverage during the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay $850,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to your minimum value, it's still significantly less than what you'd get from John. It's worth trying to push for a higher price with Bob, considering you have a backup option. You can counteroffer to bridge the gap and see if you can reach an agreement that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $875,000. I would like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and I hope it will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $860,000 is close to your minimum value of $1,000,000.  While it's not your ideal outcome, it's still a significant profit for you, and the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the price or going back and forth with Bob is not worth it. It's better to secure the sale now at a reasonable price than to risk losing out on a good deal."
