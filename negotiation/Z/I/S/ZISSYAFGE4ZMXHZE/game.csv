"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay $850,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $875,000. I would like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
