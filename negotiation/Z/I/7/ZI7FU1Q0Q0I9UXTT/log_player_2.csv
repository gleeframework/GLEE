{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  While Bob is willing to pay up to $100, Alice's counteroffer isn't appealing enough to accept at this point. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $89 is now within Bob's budget and is getting closer to his target price.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and having to buy from John for $100 is increasing. Accepting the offer now secures the product at a price that is acceptable to both parties."
