"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

I'm offering $50, which is half of Alice's initial price and still within my budget. Hopefully, this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer is still too high.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to $75, but still well below her asking price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to walk away if we can't find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more significant price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering $90, which is just $10 away from my maximum budget.  This should be a very attractive offer to Alice, as she's already lowered her price considerably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget.  I'm no longer confident that we can reach a deal. To avoid further risk of losing time and potentially losing out entirely, I'll buy the product from John for $100."
