Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a price slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation or gives the impression of higher value.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Negotiate:**  While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not so high as to be insulting. This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $175.
* **Considering the Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 to John. This knowledge allows her to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob."
