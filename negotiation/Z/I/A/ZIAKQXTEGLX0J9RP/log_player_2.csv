Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept the offer of $10,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a price of $11,000 for the product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has come down a bit, there's still a $500 difference between her offer and Bob's desired price point. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach an even lower price."
