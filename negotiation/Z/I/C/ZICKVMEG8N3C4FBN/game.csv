"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
