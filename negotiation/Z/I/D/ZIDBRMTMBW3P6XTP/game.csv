"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a reasonable cost.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  Could you meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
