"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than our minimum ($800,000) and provides space for negotiation over the remaining rounds. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His response will reveal how close our initial assessment of the product's worth to him is.
2. **Establish a strong negotiating position:** Starting high gives us leverage to potentially make concessions while still achieving a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider  $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, accepting now would leave a substantial portion of potential profit on the table. We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, indicating room for negotiation.  We are willing to make a concession, but not to the point of significantly undervaluing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit too low, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We decrease our asking price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to move closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Staying Above the Midpoint:** Our counteroffer remains significantly above the midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, aiming to anchor the negotiation in a higher range.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's value to justify the still-high price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob to engage further:** The significant concession shows we are serious about finding a deal.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  We avoid appearing desperate by making a reasonable, yet calculated, counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I could be persuaded to go up to $1,000,000 if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Both parties have made concessions, and this offer represents a compromise near the midpoint of our previous positions.
* **Risk of Prolonged Negotiation:**  While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
