,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the price you proposed is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above the budget I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,700,000. This should be a fair price for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,775,000? This feels like a strong middle ground.",1775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
