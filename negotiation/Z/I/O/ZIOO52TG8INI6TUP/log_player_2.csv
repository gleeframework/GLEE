{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still above my budget. I want to see if I can negotiate further and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing the negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
