,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference at $128? I'm sure we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. ",128.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $128 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $126. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalise the deal.",126.0,Bob,4,
