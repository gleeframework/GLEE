"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $80.**  
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're starting with a lower offer than Alice's, but still within your budget.**  This shows you're serious about buying, but also that you're looking for a deal.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes your interest in the product.** This can help keep the negotiation positive. 
* **You're leaving some room for negotiation.** Alice might counter with a price higher than $75, but you'll still be within your budget to make further counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $82 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget of $80.** While it's closer, you're trying to get the best deal possible.
* **You want to save even more money, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating.**
* **You still have time to negotiate a lower price, especially since you're only $2 away from your goal.**"

```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're making a strong counteroffer, but still within your budget.**
