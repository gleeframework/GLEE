"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned is $15000 to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
