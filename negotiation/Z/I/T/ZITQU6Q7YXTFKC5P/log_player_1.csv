Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned is $15000 to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
