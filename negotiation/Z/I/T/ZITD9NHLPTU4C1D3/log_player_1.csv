Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range where Bob might consider it.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $175 leaves room for me to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to make a deal. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm not going too high to scare Bob off, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could accept Bob's offer and get some money, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **John as a backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150 gives me leverage to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation amicable to keep the negotiation open. 
* **John's offer in the back of my mind:**  Knowing I have John as an alternative, I can confidently refuse to go lower than $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $140 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $130 is not ideal, there's a risk that further negotiations with Bob will drag on and ultimately result in a lower price. 
* **John's guaranteed sale:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at $150, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Time is valuable:**  By accepting John's offer, I can quickly and efficiently secure a good price for the product without the potential delays and uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob."
