"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you in the middle at $130, though! What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125 yet. I can do $135, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,,
