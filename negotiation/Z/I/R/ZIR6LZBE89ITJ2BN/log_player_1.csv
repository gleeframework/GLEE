Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. I hope this shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price relatively high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is consistent with his previous offer, and I'm running the risk of him walking away altogether.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting $1,200,000 is a good deal and secures a sale. I'm also aware that John is a backup option if this deal falls through, but I'd rather not rely on that."
