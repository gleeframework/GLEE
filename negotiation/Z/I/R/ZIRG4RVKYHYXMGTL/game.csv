"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? I'm happy to discuss further if that's not workable.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which still leaves me some room to make a profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a little high for me.  How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
