"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  I'm willing to go to $1,325,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
