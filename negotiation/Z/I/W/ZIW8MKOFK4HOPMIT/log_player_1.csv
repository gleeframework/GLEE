Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product.  I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This offer stands as a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. To move things along, I could go up to $700,000. Let me know if that works for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but I have a firm budget. I can offer you $775,000. This is my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is too far from my minimum acceptable price. While I could counter, his message suggests he won't go any higher. It's better to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk Bob walking away entirely."
