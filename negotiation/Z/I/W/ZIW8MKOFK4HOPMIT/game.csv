"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product.  I could consider a price of $1,100,000. This offer stands as a good compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart. To move things along, I could go up to $700,000. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $700,000 is closer, I can't accept anything below $950,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its true value.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but I have a firm budget. I can offer you $775,000. This is my final offer - if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",775000.0,Bob,6,
