"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That would give us both a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  $105 is still a little too high for me, though.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
