"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $120 is below your maximum budget of $150, it's still higher than the product's likely worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  My counteroffer of $95 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but still above her likely minimum ($80). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to counter back, while still showing my serious intent to buy. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and respectful, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $105 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above the product's likely worth to Alice. There's still room for negotiation, and I haven't exhausted my rounds yet.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** I can still try to get a better price. The ""meet in the middle"" strategy is common, but it doesn't always lead to the best outcome. 
* **The risk of buying from John is still high:** $150 is significantly more than my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  $105 is still a little too high for me, though.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm rejecting Alice's offer because I believe I can get a better price.
* **Small incremental offer:** My counteroffer of $100 is only $5 less than Alice's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly, encouraging Alice to agree to my offer."
