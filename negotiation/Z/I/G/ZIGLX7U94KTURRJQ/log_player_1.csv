Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $12,000 might seem too aggressive and could scare Bob away.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, $10,000 is still a great profit over my minimum ($8,000) and a better deal for me than selling to John."
