"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than what you could get the product for from John ($12,000). By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to buy from John at a lower cost."
