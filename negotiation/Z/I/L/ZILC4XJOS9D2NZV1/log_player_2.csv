"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My research indicates it's worth at least $1,200,000 to someone in your position. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You can get the product for $1,100,000 from Alice, which is $100,000 less than what John is asking. 
* **You're still within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is lower."
