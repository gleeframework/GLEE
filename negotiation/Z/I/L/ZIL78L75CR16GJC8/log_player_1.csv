Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing this further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is considerably below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
``` 

We've dropped our price by $75,000, demonstrating some flexibility, but holding firm above our minimum. This offer maintains a significant potential profit while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds significant value, and I'm willing to meet closer to your price.  How about $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below John's standing offer. We're in a strong negotiating position and have time on our side.  Let's encourage Bob to move closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but we're still a ways apart. This product offers significant returns, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How about $1,040,000? That reflects my desire to strike a deal while recognizing the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1040000
}
``` 

We're making smaller concessions now, signaling that we're nearing our limit. This offer keeps the pressure on Bob while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about purchasing this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's final offer matches John's standing offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations or waiting. Accepting Bob's offer secures a fair price and avoids the risk of losing both potential buyers."
