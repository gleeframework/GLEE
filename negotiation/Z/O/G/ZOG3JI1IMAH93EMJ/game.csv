,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? This is a fair price for both of us. ",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $87? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $87 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's make this deal happen.",90.0,Alice,5,
