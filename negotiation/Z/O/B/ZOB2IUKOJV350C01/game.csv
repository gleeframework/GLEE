"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of this product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, which is a fair price given its worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it is $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10000.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
