{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so you can afford to be patient and try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to pay less than her asking price.  A $150,000 reduction is a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
