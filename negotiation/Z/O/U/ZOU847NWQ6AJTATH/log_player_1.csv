"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.  I know he values the product at $800,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.  It's also a fair midpoint between our current positions, and hopefully will encourage Bob to accept."

This is a great deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to close the deal!"
