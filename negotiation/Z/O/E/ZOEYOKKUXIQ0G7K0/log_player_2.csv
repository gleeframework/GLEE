"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $120 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's negotiate and see if we can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice is meeting me in the middle, and $110 is a reasonable price. It's not worth risking going higher or buying from John at this point."
