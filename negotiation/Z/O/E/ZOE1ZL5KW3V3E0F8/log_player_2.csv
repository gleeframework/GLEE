"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget. While the product is valuable, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Bob can use the option of buying from John as leverage to try and get Alice to lower her price further."
