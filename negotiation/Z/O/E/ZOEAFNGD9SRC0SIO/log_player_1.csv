Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a good price for him since the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'll take it. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
