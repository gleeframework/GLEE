"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? It's still a fair deal for you, considering your value of $12,000, and would make this purchase a lot more appealing to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a price closer to its value to you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit, and $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering your value of $12,000, and gets us closer to a final agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
