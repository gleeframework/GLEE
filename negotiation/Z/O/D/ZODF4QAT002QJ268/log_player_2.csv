"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay $150 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You should reject the offer and see if you can get a better deal from Alice or potentially find a better product elsewhere."
