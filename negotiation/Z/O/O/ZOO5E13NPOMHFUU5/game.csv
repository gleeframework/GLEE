"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,200. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,800? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. ",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $8,800 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,700, and if the extras are truly valuable, we can close the deal.  What do you say?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,7,
