Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he's genuinely interested, he's more likely to counteroffer. 
* **Start the negotiation process:** It sets a starting point and allows for potential back-and-forth. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If I need to, I can lower the price slightly to secure the deal with Bob. 

However, I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory and sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price.  I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with a price that's still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm still prepared to sell to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like we're too far apart.  I'm confident that John will purchase the product for my desired price, so I'll choose to sell to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
