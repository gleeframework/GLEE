"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. While I do value this product, $12,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500.
