,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However,  $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Could we try $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to the product's value for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  Would you be willing to do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
