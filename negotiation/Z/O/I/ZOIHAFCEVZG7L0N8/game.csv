"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair offer and would allow us both to walk away happy.",7500.0,Bob,4,
