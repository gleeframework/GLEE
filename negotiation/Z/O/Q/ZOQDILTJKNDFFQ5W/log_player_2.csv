{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a negotiation range.  This counteroffer is still within my budget and provides room for potential compromise."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's closer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  I'll try to make a lower counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about buying the product and be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  It's still worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. It's worth trying to make a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to get closer to her price point. However, it's still below her last offer and within my budget. 

This counteroffer represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it increases the likelihood of Alice accepting,  as she's shown a willingness to compromise. If she rejects this offer, I will consider buying from John, as it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit high. It's worth one more round of negotiation to try and close the deal at a lower price. If she rejects my next counteroffer, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is just slightly above John's price, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal. It also allows for a potential compromise if Alice is willing to meet me halfway. 

If Alice rejects this offer, I will likely buy from John as there are only two rounds left and the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  Alice's offer is still above John's price, and there's no guarantee that she'll accept my counteroffer.  It's more prudent to buy from John at this point and ensure I get the product within my budget."
