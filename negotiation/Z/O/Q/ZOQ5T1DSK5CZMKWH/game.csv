"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go below $90. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount. How about we meet at $91? It's a fair price that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",91.0,Alice,5,
