"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a little more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's try to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $115 yet. I'll compromise and offer you the product for $155.",155.0,Alice,5,
