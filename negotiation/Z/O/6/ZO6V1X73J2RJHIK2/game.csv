"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My counteroffer is $675,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $675,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $625,000.  Would that be possible?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. My new counteroffer is $662,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",662500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $643,750? That would work well for me.",643750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $655,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $655,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",655000.0,Alice,7,
