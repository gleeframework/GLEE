Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting Alice closer to her ideal outcome.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to make the price more palatable.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so she can afford to be a bit bolder with her initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and how much she wants to prioritize a quick sale, she could adjust her offer higher or lower."
