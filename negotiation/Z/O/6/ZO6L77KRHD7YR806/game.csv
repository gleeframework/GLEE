"Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $180 for it.  Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but how about $130? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 just won't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is closer, but still a little high for me. What if I offered $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just isn't going to work for me. Let's meet in the middle once more. If you're willing to go to $105, I'm ready to close the deal. This is my final offer.",105.0,Alice,7,
