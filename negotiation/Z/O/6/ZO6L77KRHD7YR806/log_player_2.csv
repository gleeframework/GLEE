Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but how about $130? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 just won't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is closer, but still a little high for me. What if I offered $100? That's my final offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just isn't going to work for me. Let's meet in the middle once more. If you're willing to go to $105, I'm ready to close the deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm and her price reductions are getting smaller.  It's unlikely she'll go below $100, and even at $105, it makes more sense to take John's offer of $80."
