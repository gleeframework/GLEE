Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it would be worth $150 to you, and to make it a great deal, I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $150 to Bob. This is a significant advantage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80). 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth $150 to him, you are anchoring his perception of the value, making the $120 price seem more appealing.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
