Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway or if he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm confident that I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low for me.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum threshold."
