Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be particularly useful for someone with your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's an opportunity to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly lower than your guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. You can potentially settle somewhere between $11,500 and $12,000, still making more profit than your guaranteed sale."
