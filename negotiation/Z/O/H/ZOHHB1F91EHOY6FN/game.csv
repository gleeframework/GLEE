"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8,000? This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",8000.0,Alice,5,
