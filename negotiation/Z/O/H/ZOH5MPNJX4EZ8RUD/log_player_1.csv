Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more than $175.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Alice ends with a question, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially accept the offer.

While there's a risk Bob might reject $175, Alice has a guaranteed $150 offer from John. This strategy maximizes her chances of getting the best possible price."
