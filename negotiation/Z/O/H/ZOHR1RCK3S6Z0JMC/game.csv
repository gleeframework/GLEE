"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've researched the product to have.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $15000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $16500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is unfortunately not a viable option for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $15250? This would be a good compromise and ensure we both get a fair deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",15250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the highest I can go.",13500.0,Bob,6,
