Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a higher price. I think there's room for a better deal. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that reflects that.  How about $1,050,000?  It's a good compromise that takes into account your needs and mine. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe the product's true value justifies a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."
