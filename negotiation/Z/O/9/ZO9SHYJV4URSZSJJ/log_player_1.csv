Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $10,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's potential to sell it for a higher price. 
* **Starting High:** It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Backup Offer:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 gives Alice leverage.  She doesn't *need* to go below that price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! Alice earns a profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob might counter-offer. Alice can then decide if she wants to lower the price, keeping in mind her $8,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice still sells the product to John for her minimum acceptable price."
