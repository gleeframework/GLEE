Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly above my minimum. I'm confident Bob will find this attractive, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to counter his offer strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my desired profit.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This price still allows me a good profit while acknowledging Bob's value assessment."

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm confident I won't be able to negotiate much higher.  It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
