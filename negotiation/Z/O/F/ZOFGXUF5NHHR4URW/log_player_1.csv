{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still significantly more than what it's worth to you, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still very attractive for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, it's getting late in the negotiation and $1,250,000 is a good outcome.  There's always a chance Bob will counter my next offer, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
