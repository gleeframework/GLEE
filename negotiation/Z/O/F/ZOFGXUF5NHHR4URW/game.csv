"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still significantly more than what it's worth to you, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still very attractive for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
