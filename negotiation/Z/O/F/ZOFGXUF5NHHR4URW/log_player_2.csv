"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. It's always best to start with trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still significantly more than what it's worth to you, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still very attractive for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,300,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, but I want to see if I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's still room for both of us to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
