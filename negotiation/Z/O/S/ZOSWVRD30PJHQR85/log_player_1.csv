Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and also sends a message that I'm not desperate to sell. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation of the product. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  I still have 8 rounds left, and I can always fall back to John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I've lowered my offer, but I'm also making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further. This approach shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found out that similar products are being sold for around $860,000. Based on that information, I would like to propose $860,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further. I have 6 rounds left and can always sell to John as a last resort."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts and research. However, $860,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $865,000, which reflects the unique value of this product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 865000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. By lowering my price to $865,000, I'm showing that I'm serious about making a deal but still maintaining my desired profit. I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.  We have five rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose $862,500 as a fair price for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our respective positions.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. With only four rounds left, I'll accept his offer. I've managed to earn a good amount for the product and secure a sale."
