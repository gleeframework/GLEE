Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Offer:** The price is closer to Bob's value than my minimum, making it more likely he'll consider it. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive relationship and avoid a quick rejection.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he offers too low, I'll either counter or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Since Bob is still interested, there's a chance he might be willing to increase his offer.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  By rejecting his offer, I can keep the negotiation going and try to secure a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between his offer and my original offer, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Monitor the Situation:** I will continue to assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and consider selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While I can't quite meet your offer of $1,300,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and suggests that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Motivating Message:** The message is still positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm closer to his offer, there's still a bit of room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Great! We've reached a deal.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to consider his next counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing or if I should move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,325,000. Can we meet in the middle this time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Even though it's closer, I'm not willing to accept a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Bob is still interested and willing to negotiate, so there's a chance we can reach a better price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but there's still potential to earn more with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Assess the Situation:** I will continue to evaluate Bob's willingness to negotiate and the potential risk of losing him as a buyer.
* **Plan for Selling to John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm always willing to find common ground. While I can't go as low as $1,325,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $1,337,500. This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1337500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in between our previous two offers. This shows a commitment to finding a compromise and avoids further back-and-forth.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using encouraging language to keep the negotiation positive and avoid a stalemate.
* **Finality:**  I'm positioning this offer as a potential final offer, implying that further negotiations might be less likely.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Fantastic! We've reached a mutually acceptable price.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  This might be my final counteroffer. I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'll still gauge Bob's interest in further negotiation to see if there's any chance of reaching an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'll propose $1,325,000 again. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has declared his offer as his final one. 
* **Too Low:**  His final offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Further negotiation might be unproductive and lead to a deadlock.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially losing John as a buyer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired value and avoid further negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.  I'm not willing to lose money on this product."
