"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my usual price.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $950,000 just won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll move on to other potential buyers.",975000.0,Alice,5,
