{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** It's well above your minimum of $1,500,000, so you're not risking a huge loss if Bob rejects. 
* **It shows flexibility:** This initial offer shows you're open to negotiation and willing to compromise. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still far below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further, but I need to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my usual price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **It's firm but fair:**  $1,000,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's much lower than what he'd pay elsewhere, but it's closer to my minimum price.
* **It demonstrates flexibility:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000, showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **It keeps the door open:** I'm still willing to negotiate, but I've made it clear that I won't go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell it for that low, even though it's a better offer than John's. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $950,000 just won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show firmness:** I'm sticking to my minimum price and clearly stating this is my final offer.
* **Create urgency:**  I mention moving on to other buyers to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Offer a small concession:**  I'm coming down from $1,000,000 to $975,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This is my last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $925,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to compromise my financial goals.  Selling the product to John for $1,500,000 is a much better option for me."
