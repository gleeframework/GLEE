"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $11000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there.  How about $10500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the sale.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11000, so I'm now offering the product for $11250. It's a fair price that I think you'll find is worth the investment.",11250.0,Alice,5,
