"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $11000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11000, so I'm now offering the product for $11250. It's a fair price that I think you'll find is worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still offering a price above Bob's desired maximum of $10,000.  While the price is getting closer, it's not worth continuing to negotiate and risk losing out on a guaranteed deal with John.  Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, saving $1,250 compared to Alice's current offer."
