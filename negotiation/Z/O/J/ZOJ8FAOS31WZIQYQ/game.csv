"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is also willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
