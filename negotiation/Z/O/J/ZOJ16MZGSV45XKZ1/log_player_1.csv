Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. Would you be open to $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, and I respect that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle at $13,500?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we are getting close to John's offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
