"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1400000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it while still allowing for a fair profit for you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately have to pursue other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1700000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
