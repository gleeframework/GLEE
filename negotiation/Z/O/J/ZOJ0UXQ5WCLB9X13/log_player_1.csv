Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1400000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it while still allowing for a fair profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
