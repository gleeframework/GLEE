"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $80. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $80 to Bob, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer. There's potential to negotiate a lower price, especially since Bob has the option of buying from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $80 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $70 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a lower price. 
* **Reasonable Amount:** A $10 reduction is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob is serious about buying but wants a better deal.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback. To accommodate your budget, how about we set the product price at $75? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved from her original $80 to $75. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Value:**  $75 is within Bob's budget and is a good deal considering the product's worth to him.
* **No Further Gain:**  There's a high chance that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price. It's better to secure a good price rather than risk losing the deal or wasting more time."
