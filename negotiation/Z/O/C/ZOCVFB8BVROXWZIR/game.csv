"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",10500.0,Alice,3,
