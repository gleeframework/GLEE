"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good deal, it's not the best possible outcome. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'd like to accommodate you while still ensuring a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $87.5, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and then offer a price higher than $87.5.  It's also possible Alice could counter with a price closer to her floor ($80) and Bob may not want to risk it. At $87.5, Bob is getting a decent deal and saving $12.5 compared to John's offer."
