{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.
* **Confidence:** My message expresses confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation by inviting Bob to respond. 
* **Plan B:** Having John as a backup buyer provides me with a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $15000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but it also risks losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with confidence in accepting Bob's offer.

This decision maximizes my earnings while minimizing the risk of losing a sale."
