"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save money and is starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer and his own maximum. 
* **Fairness:** He's emphasizing fairness by framing it as a good price for both parties. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer opens a negotiation space, allowing Alice to either accept or counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved significantly closer to Bob's desired price, making this offer very attractive.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a higher price or a deal with John at $12,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal. Accepting the offer at $10,800 saves a significant amount compared to John's price."
