Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects that the product is worth more to Bob, but doesn't immediately give him the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's worth trying to push for a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly, but still leaving a bit of room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while also demonstrating the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. It's important to recognize that continuing the negotiation could lead to a rejection from Bob and force me to sell to John at a lower price. This offer secures a good profit and minimizes risk."
