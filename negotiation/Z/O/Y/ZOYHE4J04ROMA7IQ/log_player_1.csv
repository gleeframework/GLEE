"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, allowing for room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to negotiate further.  It's not worth selling to John at this point, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good price given my minimum value. I'm trying to find a middle ground while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to go with John's offer, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are simply not acceptable. I've lowered my price significantly, and it's clear he's not willing to meet me in the middle.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm running out of time and I need to secure a sale.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose out on the deal altogether."
