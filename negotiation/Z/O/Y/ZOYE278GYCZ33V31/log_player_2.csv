Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product given our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within my budget and closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up buying from John for a significantly higher price.  It's more prudent to accept this offer and secure the product."
