Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer. If he rejects, I can then consider his offer and adjust my price accordingly. If the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I can always sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  I want to maximize my profit and selling to John is still an option if this negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise.  If Bob doesn't accept this, I might consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,800 is not a terrible price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product.  I've already gone down a bit in my counteroffers, and Bob doesn't seem to be willing to budge much.  This negotiation seems to be going nowhere, and I can get a guaranteed $12,000 from John.  Therefore, I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a better deal."
