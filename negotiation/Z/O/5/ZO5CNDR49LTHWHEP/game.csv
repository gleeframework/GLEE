"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that 120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 100 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 90. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for 95. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
