"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
