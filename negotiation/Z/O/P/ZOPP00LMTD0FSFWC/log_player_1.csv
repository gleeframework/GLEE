Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000 to make selling to John not a better option. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $9,500 aims to capture the most value difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
