"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $850,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price point.  I have nine rounds left and want to maximize my profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This still represents significant value for you, and it allows me to secure a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $825,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $825,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I'm still confident I can secure a better deal. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  We've got plenty of rounds left, so I'm not going to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $875,000? It's a significant compromise on my end, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly what John is offering.  Since we're at the 6th round and I'm running out of time, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $800,000. It's a fair price and guarantees me a sale. While I would have preferred a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether with Bob."
