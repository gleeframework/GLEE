Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price of $10,000 helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he hesitates or counter-offers, it indicates his potential price range.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you won't be left with an unsold product."
