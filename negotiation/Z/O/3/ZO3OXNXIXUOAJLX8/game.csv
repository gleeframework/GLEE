"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10000 is a bit too low for me, especially considering the value this product holds. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250.  Let's make a deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
