Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has offered $105 twice now and stated it's her final offer.  While we could push for $100, there's a risk she'll walk away, and we'd end up paying $150 to John. Accepting $105 secures a reasonable discount."
