"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $150.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I agree it's a good product, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we possibly settle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $105? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute most I can justify spending on this.  Do we have a deal at that price?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
