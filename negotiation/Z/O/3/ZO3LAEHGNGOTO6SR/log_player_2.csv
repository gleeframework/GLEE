"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a beautiful product, but $2,200,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it.  I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your actual upper limit ($800,000). This leaves room for counteroffers and gives Alice the impression you have a tight budget.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful but clearly indicates the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** The goal is to get Alice to counter within a range you can work with, ideally closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down significantly, $1,900,000 is still far above your $800,000 maximum. 
* **Final Offer Bluff:** Alice stating this is her ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. She's trying to pressure you into accepting.
* **Room to Negotiate:** There's a substantial gap between her offer and your previous counteroffer. It's worth seeing if she'll move further down before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. To be frank, I'm considering another seller who's offering a similar product closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for yours, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a very strong offer."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement, with Limits:** Increasing the counteroffer to $700,000 shows Alice you're serious but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **Introducing Competition:** Mentioning another seller adds pressure on Alice, potentially making her more flexible.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Presenting $700,000 as your ""absolute limit"" mirrors Alice's tactic, aiming to bring the negotiation to a head. 
* **Decision Point:**  This offer will likely reveal if Alice is truly willing to negotiate within a range acceptable to you. If she rejects this, it might be time to go with John."
