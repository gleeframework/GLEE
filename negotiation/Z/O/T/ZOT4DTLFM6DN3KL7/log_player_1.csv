{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a high price, aiming to maximize potential profit.  However, it's important to remember:

* **John's offer is a safety net.** If Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed $1,200,000 alternative.
* **We don't know Bob's value.** This offer is a starting point, and we'll need to be flexible to gauge his interest and potentially adjust the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is our guaranteed minimum from John, it's worth exploring if we can get a bit more. We know Bob's maximum is $1,200,000, so we need to be strategic with our counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer strategically splits the difference between our initial offer and Bob's, showing flexibility while still attempting to get a higher price. This approach:

* **Keeps negotiation open:** We're not immediately accepting Bob's minimum, indicating we're not desperate and giving ourselves room to potentially increase the price further.
* **Compromises without sacrificing too much:** We've lowered our price, but not by a significant amount, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a decent profit. 

We'll now need to see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a profitable deal for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a good deal for us. It's significantly higher than our guaranteed minimum from John, and it seems unlikely we'll be able to get a significantly higher price from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale and closes the negotiation."
