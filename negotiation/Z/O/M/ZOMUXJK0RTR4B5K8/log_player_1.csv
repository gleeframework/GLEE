{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit for both parties.
* This allows for potential negotiation while still securing a good price. If Bob rejects, I can either counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $950000 to $1000000. I hope this revised proposal aligns better with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I need to hold out for a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price closer to my minimum.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good price for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* The message remains friendly and highlights the benefits for both parties.
*  I'm showing flexibility while still securing a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my financial situation, I am comfortable with a price of $1050000. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  There's still a good chance Bob might come up a bit more. I'll counter-offer and see where we land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,125,000** is a compromise halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes that this is my final offer, pushing Bob to make a decision.
* By offering a final compromise, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in negotiating. I've considered your latest offer carefully. I am willing to pay $1075000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,075,000 is a higher offer than Bob's previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. It seems Bob is unwilling to budge further, and continuing negotiations will likely yield minimal results. Given the risk of further negotiation stalemate, selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most logical choice. It guarantees me a good deal and avoids potential further losses due to extended negotiations."
