"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still more than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  John's offer is still my safety net, but I'm not ready to take that option yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. How about $1,500,000? This would allow us both to close the deal and get the transaction completed."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
