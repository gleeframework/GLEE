Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. How about $1,500,000? This would allow us both to close the deal and get the transaction completed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a good deal for me, as it matches my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
