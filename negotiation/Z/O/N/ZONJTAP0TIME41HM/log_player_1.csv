Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high initial price:**  $100 is significantly more than your minimum desired price of $80, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Showing confidence:**  The message is friendly and confident, without revealing your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Inviting a response:** This encourages Bob to either accept or counteroffer. 

Let me know how Bob responds, and we'll continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to push for a higher price. 

By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Show you are willing to negotiate:**  This demonstrates that you are not simply accepting the first offer.
* **Potentially secure a better price:**  Bob may be willing to compromise slightly to avoid losing the deal. 

We can then make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $90? That's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:**  It shows you are listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:**  $90 is a midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterates the value of the product:**  Mentioning ""great price"" emphasizes its worth.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still striving for a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Can you consider $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to your desired price.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale that's more profitable than selling to John."
