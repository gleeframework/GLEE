"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. That's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows you to get a decent profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while still being within my budget. I hope you'll consider this offer.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,250 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,750. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
