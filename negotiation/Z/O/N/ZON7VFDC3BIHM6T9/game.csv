"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $875,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
