"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $950,000?  This gives us both a good deal and ensures we both walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite ready to meet that price. How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000? I believe that's a fair offer for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
