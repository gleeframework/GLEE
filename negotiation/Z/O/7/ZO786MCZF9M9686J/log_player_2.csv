"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget, and he has a better option with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $17,000 is lower than the original offer, it is still higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. Since he can buy the product from John for his maximum price, he should continue negotiating with Alice or move to John."
