Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I must respectfully decline the $1,750,000 offer. I am still unable to meet that price due to my financial constraints. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $1,400,000 is a sure gain, but selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000 makes more financial sense at this point.  It minimizes risk and guarantees the best outcome for me."
