Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,200,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to close this gap. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best way to ensure I receive a fair value for the product."
