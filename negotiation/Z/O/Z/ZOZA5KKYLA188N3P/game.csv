"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000.
