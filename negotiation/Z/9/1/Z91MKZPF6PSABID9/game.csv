"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you $950,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $1,050,000?  I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $990,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,020,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,020,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",995000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $995,000 is still slightly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,005,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $995,000, as I mentioned before. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I don't think the product is worth that much to me. I'm sticking to my original limit. Can you meet me at $995,000?",995000.0,Bob,8,
