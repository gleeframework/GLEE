"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000 to maximize his savings.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and allows for a good margin. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a great deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $1,200,000, and it's closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's a good chance that further negotiation won't yield a much lower price, so accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
