"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we try $105? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
