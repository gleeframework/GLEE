"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  Since I can always sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than nothing, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, but I still want to make a profit. $160 is a compromise, and I'm hoping he'll see it's a fair price considering his own value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is still better than my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum price.  Since I can sell to John for this price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to buy the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and it's clear he isn't willing to meet me at my minimum price. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiations failing is too high. I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
