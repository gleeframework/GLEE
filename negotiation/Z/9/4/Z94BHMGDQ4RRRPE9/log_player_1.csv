I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident that this is a reasonable deal, and I'd rather secure a sale than risk losing the deal entirely."
