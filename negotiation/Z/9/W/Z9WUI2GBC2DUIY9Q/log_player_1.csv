Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good profit.  It's a fair starting point considering the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still a good deal for me.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be less profitable, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit."
