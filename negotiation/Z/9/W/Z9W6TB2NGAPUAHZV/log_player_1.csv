Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested, while still securing a profit if he accepts the initial offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's important to remember we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This knowledge gives us leverage and allows us to be firm with Bob."
