"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
