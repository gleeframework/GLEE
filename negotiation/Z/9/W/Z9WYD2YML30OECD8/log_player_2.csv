# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, but there's still a chance to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or get closer to your $100 target."
