Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $10,000, and this is significantly higher.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so this is attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back and forth to potentially reach a price that benefits both of you even more. 

Let me know how Bob responds, and we can adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than your initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. You can likely get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial one.  Would you consider $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  You're not sticking to your original price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Is closer to your desired price:** $13,000 is a good middle ground between your original offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Keeps the negotiation open:** This gives Bob another chance to meet you halfway, potentially reaching a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 less than your desired $12,000.  This is a good deal considering you could sell to John for $10,000.  It's better to close the deal now rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
