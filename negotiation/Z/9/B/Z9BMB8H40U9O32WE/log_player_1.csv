"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product at a price higher than my minimum. I want to maximize my profit, but I also don't want to scare him off with an overly high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering at $190. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that might be acceptable to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is still above my minimum, I think I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 185}
```

I'm counteroffering at $185. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I want to see if he's willing to budge a little more. I'm getting closer to my target price, and I want to try to get a better deal before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $170 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to squeeze a little more out of the deal. I think I can still get closer to my target price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. I've decided to meet Bob halfway from his last offer. With only a few rounds left, I want to see if this is a price he's willing to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision. While $165 isn't ideal, it's still above my minimum and with only 2 rounds left, I risk losing the deal completely if I keep rejecting.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than to potentially get nothing at all."
