"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $140 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $145.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and this is the best price I can offer.",145.0,Alice,7,
