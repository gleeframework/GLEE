"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $11,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $10,750? That's a good compromise, and it allows me to still get a reasonable price for the product.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $10,750 is still a bit higher than what I can manage right now.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $10,625.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it helps me stay within my budget.",10625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $10,650? That's only $25 more than your offer, and it's a small step toward a deal we can both be happy with.",10650.0,Alice,5,
