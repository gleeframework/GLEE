,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's try $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
