``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  You're still making a $125,000 profit over what John is offering.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield a much higher offer from Bob. The longer it takes, the less attractive the deal becomes due to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a chance Bob could walk away from the table. Accepting now locks in a very good price."
