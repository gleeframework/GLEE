Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages a dialogue, increasing the chance Bob might counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the initial price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the guaranteed sale to John as a safety net."
