"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $13000, so I'll offer $12000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I've made a lot of concessions already, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $12000. I'm still $2000 below my minimum price, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
