Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop the price to $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make some profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed price from John."
