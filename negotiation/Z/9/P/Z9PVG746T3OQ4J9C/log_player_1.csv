Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By framing the offer as a special opportunity and highlighting the product's value to Bob, you increase the chances of him accepting a higher price. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but don't go below your minimum of $10,000."
