"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that is more than fair for both of us.  Please consider this offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This means you'll save $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still a good deal for you as you're paying less than what you value the product at."
