Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $14,500. I know you'll find great value in it."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still offers him a saving of $500. This price might be tempting enough for him to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out since John is willing to pay your desired price."
