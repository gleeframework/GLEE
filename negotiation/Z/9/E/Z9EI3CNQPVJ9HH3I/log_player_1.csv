Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price later. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as it's below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still protecting my interests. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my options, but I'm hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough for me to sell the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe we can find a price that's more fair. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $16,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a price close to my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while, and we're not getting closer to an agreement.  I'm starting to feel like he's just trying to wear me down.  I'm not comfortable accepting $13,000, as it's still below my minimum value.  I've made significant concessions already, and I don't think it's worth continuing the negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
