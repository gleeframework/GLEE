Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in acquiring the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than your valuation and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.

This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and allows us to reach an agreement that is fair to both parties. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
