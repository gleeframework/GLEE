"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great price considering the value to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
