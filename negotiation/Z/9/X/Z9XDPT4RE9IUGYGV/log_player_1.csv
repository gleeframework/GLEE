"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by presenting a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. There are still more rounds to go, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great price considering the value to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $7,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  We've got a few rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $8,000, my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is equal to my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay.  Since this is the best offer I've received so far, I'm going to accept it.  It's a good outcome, as I'm maximizing my profit."
