Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also significantly below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate.  

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target price, I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is still below Bob's perceived value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while staying closer to my goal of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. It's only $20,000 below my target price, and it's still much better than selling to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
