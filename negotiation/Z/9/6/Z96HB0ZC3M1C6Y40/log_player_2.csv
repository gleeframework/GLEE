"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $150. It's better to reject and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'd like to see if I can get it lower. John is offering the product for my maximum price, so I'm not in a rush to buy from Alice just yet."
