"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it's also a good deal for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's value, you know you can get a better deal from John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
