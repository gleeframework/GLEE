"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer to my target, I'm still a little higher than what I can afford right now.  Would you consider $10,750?  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
