"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. How about offering the product at $950,000? This price is still above what I consider fair value, but closer to what I am willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $975,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!",975000.0,Alice,3,
