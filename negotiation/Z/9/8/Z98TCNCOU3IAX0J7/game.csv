"Bob, I understand your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you given the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
