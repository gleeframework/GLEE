"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget and your maximum value for the product.  It's definitely worth negotiating. You have a strong position as you can walk away and buy from John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my maximum value for this product. I understand this is a lower offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum value of $8,000.  I still have a strong position because I can buy from John for a better price.  Therefore, I will continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'll meet you at $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is a considerable decrease from her initial price, it is still higher than my maximum value of $8,000.  It's still worthwhile to continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further. I can still buy from John for a lower price if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'll meet you at $11500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is the last time I'll make a concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still higher than my maximum value of $8,000. While I could continue negotiating, there is a strong chance that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price. Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to buy from John at $8,000 to guarantee a good deal and avoid risking further negotiation rounds with Alice that may not lead to a successful outcome."
