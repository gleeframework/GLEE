"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. It's a great price, considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice and she's offering it for $900,000.  It's worth $1,200,000 to Bob. There's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $950,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $975,000? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

```

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a rejection from Alice, and Bob might have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and saves him money compared to buying from John."
