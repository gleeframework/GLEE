"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to sound enthusiastic but not desperate.  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm encouraging him to engage in the negotiation process.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited to $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm seeking a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a substantial gap from what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,450,000 is more reflective of that.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've made a sizable reduction from my initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob.  However, I'm still well above my absolute minimum ($1,200,000) and angling for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Highlight Value:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits, hopefully justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** My message emphasizes compromise and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This keeps the negotiation positive and moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Good Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me a profit of $100,000, which is a good outcome.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:**  Bob has negotiated well and is unlikely to go much higher.  
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Bob walks away, or I might miss out on other opportunities. Accepting now secures a solid profit."
