Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this product before it's offered elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially gain an extra $400,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, offering it at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for you while still being below his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that the product will be offered elsewhere creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell to John at your minimum desired price. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a worthwhile negotiation tactic."
