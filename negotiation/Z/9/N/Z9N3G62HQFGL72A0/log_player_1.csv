Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $11,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's inclined. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While Alice could start higher, it might alienate Bob. Offering a price that seems fair increases the chance of a quick sale.
* **John as a Backup:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so she doesn't need to undervalue the product.

This offer balances ambition with a realistic chance of success."
