It's not a good deal to buy for $850,000 when I can get the same product for $800,000 from John. Let's try to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $820,000. I believe the product's value justifies this price, considering its quality and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be open to discussing further?

While Alice is willing to negotiate, $820,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $815,000. I've already met you halfway and compromised on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $815,000?

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $815,000 is still more than I want to pay. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. I'll buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid any potential further concessions."
