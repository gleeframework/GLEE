Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm confident I can get at least $80 from John if the deal falls through, so I have some flexibility here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a price of $85. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my original price.  I'm hopeful this will be enough to reach an agreement, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I get the minimum I'm willing to accept."
