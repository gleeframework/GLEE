# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1200000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price.
