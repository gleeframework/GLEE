"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" subtly justifies the high asking price, even though it's considerably above Bob's perceived value.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  Indicating a willingness to discuss the price portrays flexibility and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how interested he is and what price range he might consider.
2. **Anchor High:** Even if he rejects the initial offer, it sets a high reference point for subsequent negotiations. 
3. **Maintain Control:** By starting high, you control the initial pace and direction of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation, so rejecting and countering is the best strategy.

While selling to John is always an option, it's worth exploring if you can reach a better agreement with Bob before taking the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still above both your minimum and Bob's valuation, this counteroffer shows movement and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value helps justify the still-high price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Framing it as finding ""middle ground"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with movement on his end.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Avoids drastic price drops that could weaken your negotiating stance.
* **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  His response will indicate how much he's willing to budge from his initial offer. 
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  Shows you're serious about reaching a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $950,000. That's a significant investment, and I'm serious about making this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still substantially below your $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting now would mean a significant loss. 

It's crucial to:

* **Hold Firm:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate upwards suggests there's more room for him to move.
* **Signal Your Limit:** Continue to reject offers significantly below your threshold to communicate you won't settle for a low price.

You're still in a strong position to negotiate, and it's too early to settle for an offer this far below your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer shows progress, we need to bridge the gap further.  Considering the value this product will bring, I'm proposing $1,700,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Controlled Concession:** This counteroffer lowers the price by $200,000, a significant drop but still keeps you well above your $1,500,000 minimum and signals to Bob you are negotiating.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  The phrase ""fair compromise"" subtly introduces urgency while implying that this is a concession on your part and encouraging Bob to reciprocate. 

This offer aims to:

* **Encourage Reciprocity:** The substantial price drop puts pressure on Bob to make a more significant move upward. 
* **Maintain a Realistic Position:**  The price is still within a reasonable range given Bob's initial offer and his perceived value of the product.
* **Move Towards a Resolution:** With fewer rounds remaining, this offer aims to push the negotiation towards a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds real value, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $1,100,000? This represents a significant offer on my part, and I hope we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still below your $1,500,000 minimum. While Bob's offer is getting more serious, there's a good chance he'll go even higher, especially since he expressed a desire to close the deal soon.

Here's why rejecting and countering is still the best strategy:

* **Maintain Negotiation Power:** Accepting at this point could signal that you're willing to settle lower, potentially leaving money on the table.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, it's crucial to push Bob closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have the security of John's offer. This allows you to be bolder in your negotiation with Bob. 

It's time to signal your limit more strongly while still encouraging Bob to continue negotiating upwards."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer demonstrates a strong commitment, and I value that. To be completely transparent, I can't accept anything less than $1,500,000 for this product. This is my bottom line, and it reflects the true worth of what's being offered. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm hopeful we can find a way to make this work."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Your Minimum:** With time running out, it's strategic to be transparent about your absolute bottom line. This eliminates any ambiguity and sets a clear target for Bob.
* **Firm but Fair:**  You acknowledge Bob's commitment while standing firm on your price, emphasizing its fairness.
* **Call to Action:** Expressing hope that a deal can be reached encourages Bob to consider your position seriously and make a final push.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Prompt a Decision:** Bob now understands your non-negotiable minimum, increasing the likelihood of him either accepting or making a final, best offer.
* **Maintain Integrity:** By being transparent, you build trust, even if the negotiation doesn't result in a deal.
* **Control the Endgame:**  You dictate the terms of the remaining rounds and put the decision firmly in Bob's court."
