"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1750000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  Selling to Bob for $1,200,000 would be a significant loss. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to the value I'm looking for.  How about $1,600,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this valuable product.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've only got 4 rounds left. I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  Selling to John will guarantee me my minimum and avoid any further risk of losing the deal."
