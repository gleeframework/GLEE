,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $125 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $125, which would be $137.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $130, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $130, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,6,
