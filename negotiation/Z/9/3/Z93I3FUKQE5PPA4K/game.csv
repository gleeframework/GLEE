"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and the opportunity to work together. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
