"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the market value.  I understand this might be a large investment, so take your time to consider it. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John for $1,000,000, but I'd rather see you benefit from this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
