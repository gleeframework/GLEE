"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the market value.  I understand this might be a large investment, so take your time to consider it. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John for $1,000,000, but I'd rather see you benefit from this opportunity.",900000.0,Alice,1,
