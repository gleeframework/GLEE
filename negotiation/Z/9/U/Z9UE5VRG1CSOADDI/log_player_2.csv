Alice's offer:

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you can get the product from John for $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still within your budget and closer to your desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a chance Alice might walk away and you'll have to settle for John's price."
