# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I can do better by either making another counteroffer or going with John's offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if we can find a price closer to $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 still isn't quite enough for me. Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still not within my ideal range. At this point, I've made multiple counteroffers, and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,000,000. To avoid further negotiation and potentially more counteroffers, it's best to secure the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees the purchase within my budget and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice without a guaranteed outcome."
