I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would still allow you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer of $920,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and I still earn a significant profit."
