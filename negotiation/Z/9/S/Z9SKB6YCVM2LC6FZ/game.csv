"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product for $82.50. Let me know if that works for you.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $80? That way we both get a good deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $81.25 is a fair price for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",81.25,Alice,5,
