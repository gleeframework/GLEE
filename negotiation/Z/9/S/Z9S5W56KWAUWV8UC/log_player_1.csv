Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that Bob knows the product is worth more to him than $1,200,000, so I want to be ambitious but also leave space for him to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to what I think the product is worth."
