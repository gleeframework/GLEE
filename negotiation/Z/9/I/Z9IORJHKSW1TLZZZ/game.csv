"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I'm still paying a premium for the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
