"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $110 is still too low for me. How about $115? That's still a great price for you, considering the product is worth $150.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  I'm going to come down to $109.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's finalize this deal.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,8,
