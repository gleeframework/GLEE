"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This represents a significant discount from my original offer and is still a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's keep the conversation going.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
