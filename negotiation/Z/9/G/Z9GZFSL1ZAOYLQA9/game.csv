"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I see the value in this product,  $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a significant discount for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $9,800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not quite there. While I recognize the value this product brings, $9,800 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm prepared to offer you $9,200, which is a significant compromise on my part. I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this point.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,200 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about this deal. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still just a little too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $9,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair to both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my previous offer. I'll offer it to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,9,
