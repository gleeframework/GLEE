"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer ($1,100,000), aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial price leaves space for potential concessions while still remaining well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the negotiation as a mutually beneficial opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob's initial offer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount for the product. We have room to counter and try to secure a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Considering the unique value proposition of this product and its potential for your business, I can adjust my offer to $1,025,000. This reflects a more agreeable middle ground while acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant concession ($75,000) from our initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** We tie the concession to the product's value, subtly anchoring the price point above $1,000,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a collaborative and understanding tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Goal:** This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to the $1 million mark while keeping a comfortable margin above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but  $1,025,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $950,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Momentum:** While $950,000 is tempting, Bob's concessions and tone suggest he might be willing to go higher. Rejecting keeps the negotiation active.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** We still have John's offer as a fallback, so we're not pressured to accept a less-than-ideal price from Bob. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With several rounds remaining, we can afford a more calculated approach to maximize our potential profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your budget considerations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $987,500? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen while recognizing the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 987500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and our previous price. 
* **Psychological Element:**  The specific figure ($987,500) feels more considered than a round number, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal and positions this counteroffer as a fair solution for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a middle ground. To be honest, $975,000 is the absolute highest I can go. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, and $975,000 is a very good price, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** His language (""absolute highest"") suggests this is likely his best offer, and further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more, the difference is now relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:** Securing the deal now also provides faster access to the capital, which often has its own value."
