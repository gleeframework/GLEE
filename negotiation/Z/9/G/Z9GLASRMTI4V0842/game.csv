"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value the product holds for you. Let's find a compromise!",11000.0,Alice,3,
