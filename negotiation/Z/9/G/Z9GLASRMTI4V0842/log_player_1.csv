Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that is still below Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  This allows for potential for a middle ground.
* **Not going too high:** Going too high risks losing Bob immediately and potentially having to settle for John's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I can sell to John for $10,000,  I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value the product holds for you. Let's find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Reasoning and appeal:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the potential value for Bob. This could help convince him to accept."
