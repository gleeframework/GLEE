"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference and try $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $1,275,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
