"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $12,000 is a substantial step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects. This approach shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of finding a middle ground.  $12,500 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest one, showing that he's willing to meet halfway. It also leaves just enough room for Alice to accept without feeling like she's losing too much, while still getting Bob a decent discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $13,500, which is just $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $12,500.  This is a significant step towards a deal.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's getting late in the game, and the risk of Alice rejecting his offer again, or him needing to buy from John at a higher price is increasing. It's a good time to accept and finalize the deal."
