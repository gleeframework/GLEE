"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to find this price attractive since it's less than the product's value to him. This also allows me to assess his level of interest and potential negotiation tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. Bob's initial counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate, so I'll continue to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. This should keep the negotiation moving while maintaining a favorable position for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a tempting offer, I still believe I can achieve a higher price.  We're only four rounds in, and I'm confident that by continuing to negotiate, I can secure a price closer to my desired $13,000 mark.  Furthermore, selling to John at this stage would be a significant loss for me, making the risk of continuing the negotiations worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $13,500. This is a small increase from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise but still pushing for a higher price. This move also signals to Bob that I'm not willing to go much lower, potentially pushing him to accept the offer."
