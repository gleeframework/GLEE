Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum.  Any deal will require creativity or flexibility from one or both parties.

**Possible Strategies**

1. **High Anchor, Potential Negotiation:**
    *  Start with a high offer significantly above Bob's perceived value (e.g., $1,200,000).  This aims to:
        * Anchor the negotiation in your favor.
        * Potentially uncover if Bob values the product more than he's letting on.
    * Be prepared to negotiate down, but never below $1,000,000. 

2. **Direct Sale to John:**
    * Since there's no ZOPA based on the current information, selling directly to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price.

**The Offer (Using Strategy 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing the details further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, Strategy 2 (selling directly to John) might be more efficient.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, factor that into your strategy. A very high offer might strain the relationship even if you negotiate down.
* **Information is Key:**  Is there any information you could gather about Bob's needs that might justify him paying a higher price?
