Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but low enough that he might consider it a bargain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing my profit. 
* **Considering the Guaranteed Sale:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, securing a slightly lower price with Bob is still more profitable if he accepts."
