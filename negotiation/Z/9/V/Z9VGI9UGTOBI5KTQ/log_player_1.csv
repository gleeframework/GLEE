"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is too far below my desired price.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? That would be a great price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would help me reach my goal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding my position.  $12,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,750. How about it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, $11,750 is a good deal and getting closer to Bob's budget.  It's important to strike a balance here.  I have a good chance of closing the deal with Bob and getting a good price."
