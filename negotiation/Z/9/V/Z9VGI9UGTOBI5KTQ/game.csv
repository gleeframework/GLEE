"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is too far below my desired price.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? That would be a great price for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would help me reach my goal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding my position.  $12,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,750. How about it?",11750.0,Bob,6,
