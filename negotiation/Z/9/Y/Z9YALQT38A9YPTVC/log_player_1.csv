Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
