"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this first offer is a way to gauge his interest and potential range."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can close the deal at a slightly higher price. There's still time, and I don't want to settle for less than I think I can get."
