{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $140. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's meet in the middle, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $130, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $132 is close enough to my desired price point that I'll accept it.  It's better than selling to John for $120, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
