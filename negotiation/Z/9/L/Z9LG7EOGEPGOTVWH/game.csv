"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to keep negotiating, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise at $800,000. This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's make it happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
