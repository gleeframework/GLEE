Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can close the gap a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is still a good amount for me and hopefully, a fair compromise for Bob. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not willing to drop too low."
