{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd normally charge. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $80, I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Offering a ""deal"":**  Phrasing it as a deal for both of us helps establish a collaborative tone and potentially incentivizes Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going all in with my initial offer. This allows for back-and-forth negotiation.

**If Bob rejects:** I will assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If his offer is too low, I will either counter with a higher price or choose to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While his offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a deal closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even if I can't reach a deal with Bob, I have a guaranteed $150 from John, making me less inclined to accept an offer that's significantly below my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price between $120 and $140. This will give me some room for further negotiation while still protecting my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to stay within your budget while ensuring I receive a reasonable amount for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm proposing $130, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit. This can encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Address Bob's budget concern:**  I'm acknowledging his budget constraints, showing that I'm considering his perspective.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm keeping the conversation open and leaving room for further discussion. 

**If Bob rejects:**  I'll reassess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter with another offer, or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $130, which would be $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Although Bob has moved slightly closer to my minimum acceptable price, $125 is still below my desired range.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I have the chance to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a reliable backup:**  Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, giving me the confidence to hold out for a more favorable offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $130. I'll try to find a compromise that addresses Bob's budget concerns while ensuring I receive a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $128.  This is a very fair compromise that allows me to meet your price point while still securing a reasonable price for my product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $128, a slight decrease from my previous offer of $130. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $128 is a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially encouraging him to accept.
* **Positive language:**  I use positive language like ""let's make this deal happen!"" to create a sense of momentum and encourage a quick decision.

**If Bob rejects:** 

I'll need to carefully consider my options.  I can:

* **Counter with $129:** If Bob is close to accepting, I might offer one more slight reduction.
* **Accept $125:**  If I'm feeling pressured, I might accept his offer to avoid losing the deal.
* **Sell to John:**  If the negotiations drag on, I might accept John's offer of $150 to secure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is not changing:**  Bob is sticking with his $125 offer, showing he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks lowering the price further, potentially dropping below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  John's offer of $150 is a guaranteed sale. This provides a safe and profitable exit from the negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd like to get a better price, continuing to negotiate with Bob is risky. It's safer and more profitable to sell to John for $150."
