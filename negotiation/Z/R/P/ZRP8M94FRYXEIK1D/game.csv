"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd normally charge. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to stay within your budget while ensuring I receive a reasonable amount for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $130, which would be $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $128.  This is a very fair compromise that allows me to meet your price point while still securing a reasonable price for my product.  Let's make this deal happen!",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
