Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  I want to see if we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, so I'll accept his offer."
