Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
