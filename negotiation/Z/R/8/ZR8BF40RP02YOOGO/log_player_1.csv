Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to offer a price that Bob might accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than his valuation to entice him.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and Alice will get $12,000 from John. However, offering a price closer to $8,000 significantly increases the chance of Bob accepting. 

By offering $11,500, Alice leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation."
