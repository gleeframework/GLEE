"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to spend $82. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we try $79? It's a small step down from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $79. Would you be willing to meet me at $76?",76.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $78, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for the product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value.",78.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $78. Would you be willing to meet me at $77?",77.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I'll meet you at $78.5, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",78.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making one last concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $78.5. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $77 and $78.5, which would be $78.25. Would you be willing to accept that?",78.25,Bob,10,
