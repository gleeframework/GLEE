"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,800 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about $11,200? That's a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value at $10,000.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",11100.0,Bob,4,
