Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $13,500 allows Bob to save $1,500, making it an attractive deal. At the same time, you secure a $3,500 profit, which is significantly better than selling to John.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning that you'll list the product publicly, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later."
