"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's true value while still giving you a substantial return on your investment.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,050,000. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  However,  $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. To move this forward, I can go down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,025,000. Can we discuss further?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
