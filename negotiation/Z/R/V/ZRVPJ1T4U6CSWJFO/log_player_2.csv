"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's something that's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll choose to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} because Alice's offer of $12,500 is higher than what I'm willing to pay ($15,000 is the max I'm willing to pay, and I can get it for that price from John)."
