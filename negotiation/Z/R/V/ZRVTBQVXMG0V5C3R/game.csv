"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I've been watching its value grow and I know it has the potential to be a real game changer for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true market value.  Let's chat about it and see if we can make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still significantly below its market value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product. While I still believe its true value is higher, I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm coming down to $975,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I hope it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,5,
