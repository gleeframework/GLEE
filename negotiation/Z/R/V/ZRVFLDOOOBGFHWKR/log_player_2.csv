"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $5,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and sets the stage for negotiation. It's likely Alice will reject this, but it will give me an idea of her lower limit and allows me to gradually increase my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm going to reject and counter offer again to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to $8,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still significantly lower than her current price. This will hopefully lead to a more balanced negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $17,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer to see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to $12,000. This is still below her current price, but getting closer.  My goal is to see if I can get Alice to meet me somewhere in the middle, especially since I have a backup option with John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $16,500 is still above my comfort zone. I'm going to reject and make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. If she rejects again, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer to $14,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing her I'm willing to negotiate but also setting a limit. If she rejects this, I'll go with John as the price difference is not significant enough to keep haggling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has rejected my last counteroffer and is still offering a price of $16,000, which is higher than I am willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000.  I've already negotiated as much as I can with Alice, and it's not worth risking further price increases by continuing to negotiate."
