"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget ($12,000).**  
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.** 
* **Buying from John immediately would be the same price as Bob's maximum budget, but negotiation might allow for savings.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $11,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where there's potential for a deal.
* **Be polite and show interest:**  Bob emphasizes his interest in the product to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leave room for compromise:** Bob's offer is lower than his maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

* **Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price lower than his maximum budget and potentially save money.** 
* **Buying from John would be more expensive and less advantageous.**"
