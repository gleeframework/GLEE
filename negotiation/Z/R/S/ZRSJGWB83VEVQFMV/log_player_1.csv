Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I won't accept less than $1,500,000, so I need to leave room for negotiation.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so I want to start with a price that is significantly higher but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage in negotiation.

This offer is aggressive but leaves space for negotiation and allows me to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is a secure fallback:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I can likely get a better price by countering Bob's offer, potentially getting closer to my desired price point.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which reflects a significant discount for you.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** While $1,300,000 is still above Bob's offer, it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product to justify my counteroffer.

This counteroffer strikes a balance between being firm in my price and showing flexibility, increasing the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is secure and profitable:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and a significant profit. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, indicating further negotiation may be futile.

Selling to John is the most logical choice as it eliminates any further risk of getting a lower price and ensures I achieve my financial goal."
