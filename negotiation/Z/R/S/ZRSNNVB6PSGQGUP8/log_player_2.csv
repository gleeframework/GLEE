"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to explore potential savings.  $6,000 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower before committing.  We have 9 rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (40% off) is a strong negotiating tactic. It shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal, and it opens the door for a potential compromise. We'll see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my target price.  We have 7 rounds remaining to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $4,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want a significant discount. We are now within $1,000 of Alice's offer, so hopefully, we can find a middle ground in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,200 is tempting, we are still quite far from my target price. We have 5 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to the $4,500 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $4,750. This is a significant increase from the previous offer and is likely to be closer to Alice's acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to get more aggressive in our negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,000, which is only $500 above my last counteroffer. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that we might not reach an agreement, and I'll be forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
