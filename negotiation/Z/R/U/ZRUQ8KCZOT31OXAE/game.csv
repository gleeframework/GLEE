"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $700000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $600000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $650000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $650000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $625000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $630000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",630000.0,Alice,5,
