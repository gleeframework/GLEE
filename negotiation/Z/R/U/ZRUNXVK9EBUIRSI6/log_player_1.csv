Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 offers a reasonable markup from your minimum acceptable price. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a profit above your baseline.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims for a confident tone, suggesting the value of the product justifies the price. This can make Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $175. You can adjust your offer based on your understanding of Bob's negotiating style or how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
