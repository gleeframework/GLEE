"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, he can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her. This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly better than her initial offer. It's still significantly higher than Bob's preferred price point. It's worth exploring if a lower counteroffer will be successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still maintaining a price point lower than Alice's most recent offer. This shows flexibility while staying within his budget.  It is likely Alice will either accept this offer or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget. However, there's still a possibility that Alice will continue to reject offers and try to squeeze more money out of Bob.  Since Bob has a readily available alternative with John for $15,000, it's  more strategic to accept the known price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
