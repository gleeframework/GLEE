Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his last offer. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on $2,000. It's better to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
