"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1200000, recognizing the significant value it holds for you. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the value of this product to me, but I'm prepared to offer $950000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer to my starting point, I'm still confident in the product's value and believe a price of $1100000 reflects its potential for your business. This is my final counteroffer for now. I'm happy to continue discussing, but I'm also considering other options.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which represents a fair value based on my assessment. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your valuation, $1000000 is still a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm ready to finalize the deal if you agree.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
