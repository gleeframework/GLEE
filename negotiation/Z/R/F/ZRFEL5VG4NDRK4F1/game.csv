"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you be open to $10,000? I feel that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Perhaps we could agree on $12,000? This would be my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
