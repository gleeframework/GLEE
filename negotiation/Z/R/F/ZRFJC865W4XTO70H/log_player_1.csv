"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting with a high offer ($1,800,000) sets the stage for negotiation.  It's above your minimum value but leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. 
* **Strategic fallback:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his perceived value and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly. 

**Important Note:** I'm choosing a significant margin between my minimum value and the initial offer to leave room for negotiation. The goal is to maximize profits, but I'm also aware that Bob might be willing to pay more than my minimum, so it's important to explore that possibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  While $1,200,000 is acceptable, it doesn't leave any room for profit. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are 8 rounds left. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Assessing Bob's perspective:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This might encourage Bob to reconsider his offer. 

**Next Move:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer. It's important to be strategic and consider how much I want to lower my initial offer.  I need to find a balance between staying profitable and showing flexibility to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a significant decrease from my initial $1,800,000 but still above my minimum value of $1,200,000.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential profit.
* **Strategic positioning:** By offering $1,500,000, I am inviting Bob to meet me halfway. This approach might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Staying flexible:**  With 7 rounds remaining, I have plenty of time to adjust my price if necessary.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can further refine my strategy based on his response. 

**Important Note:**  I am focusing on a reasonable counteroffer that balances my desire for profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Persistent negotiation:** Bob is sticking to his minimum price, but with 6 rounds remaining, it's still worth exploring if I can get him to budge. 
* **Seeking a better outcome:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm hoping to earn more. 
* **Strategic pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I aim to put pressure on him. This might make him realize that I'm serious about achieving a higher price and could encourage him to reconsider.

**Next Move:**  I will make another counteroffer, but it needs to be carefully considered. It's important to find a balance between offering a price that's attractive to Bob without sacrificing too much profit."

Round 5

```

**Explanation:**

* **Further compromise:** This offer is a slight decrease from my previous offer of $1,500,000, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Strategic positioning:** By lowering the price to $1,400,000, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency. This might motivate Bob to reconsider his offer, knowing that further negotiation may not be possible.
* **Balancing profit and negotiation:**  This offer keeps my profit margin at a reasonable level while still presenting a price that is potentially appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This round is crucial. With only 5 rounds left, I need to carefully weigh my options. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in this price and accepts. If he rejects, I will need to reassess my strategy for the remaining rounds."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing. 
* **Below minimum value:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is below my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, this decision ensures that I achieve my minimum target profit.  It's a strategic choice to avoid further risk and secure a guaranteed outcome."
