"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value I'm holding it at, and significantly above your estimated value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. It's still higher than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal."
