"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,250,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. This would still be a significant profit for you and a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable profit. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,150,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.
* **It's a significant saving:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **There's no guarantee of a better price:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
