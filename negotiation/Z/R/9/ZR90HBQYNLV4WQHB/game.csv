"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price much closer to $600,000 for this to work for me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my desire to see this work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still far above what I'm able to spend.  If you're able to move closer to the $700,000 mark, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this and I want to find a solution. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $950,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount.",950000.0,Alice,5,
