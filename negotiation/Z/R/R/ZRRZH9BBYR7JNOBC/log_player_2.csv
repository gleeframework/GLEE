"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $900,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by purchasing from John.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and attempt to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 800000}
