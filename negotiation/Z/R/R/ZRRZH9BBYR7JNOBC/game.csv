"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $900000 is higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,
