"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay somewhere around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While the product looks great, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be totally honest, my absolute limit for this is $12,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  It's a great product, and I'd be happy to buy it from you at that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
