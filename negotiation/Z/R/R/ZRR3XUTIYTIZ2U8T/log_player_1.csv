Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value while still leaving room for negotiation. I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer is a significant jump.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'm hoping this initial offer sparks his interest and motivates him to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I have a good backup option with John, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but it's still within my desired range and closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him further. I have John as a solid backup, giving me the confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes that I'm not willing to go below my value. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm not comfortable going any lower than my minimum value. Bob's offer is significantly below that.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to end the negotiation with Bob and secure the deal with John."
