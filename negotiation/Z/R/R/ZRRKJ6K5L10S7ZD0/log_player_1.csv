Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it holds immense value.  I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can justify the price. Can we discuss a more reasonable price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, especially considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer, and I have 8 more rounds to work with before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction in price, but I'm still not sure I can justify $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and it's the same price I could get from John. I've already rejected his lower offers and I'm not willing to risk further negotiations. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
