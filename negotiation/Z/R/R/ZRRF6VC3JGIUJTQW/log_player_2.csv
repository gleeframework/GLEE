{""product_price"": 750000}

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000 from Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates my serious intent to negotiate while also leaving room for compromise. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to Alice and my own budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers are consistently getting higher, and with only three rounds left, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly.  I've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's clear she's not willing to budge much.  While I'd prefer to pay less, buying from John for $1,000,000 ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
