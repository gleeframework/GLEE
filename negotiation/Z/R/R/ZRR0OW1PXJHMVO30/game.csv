"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about we bring the price down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers tremendous value, and to find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
