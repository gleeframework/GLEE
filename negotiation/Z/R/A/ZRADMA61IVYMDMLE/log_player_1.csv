Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to entice him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing the message as an opportunity for Bob to get a great deal,  making him more likely to counteroffer. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. While I am open to negotiation, I am not willing to sell at such a low price, as I am confident I can get a better price from John.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable agreement, or I can choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,200 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a firm but fair price:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the deal I'm offering. 
* **Open for continued discussion:**  I'm keeping the negotiation open by asking Bob for his thoughts, encouraging him to counter again if needed. 

This strategy aims to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully reach an agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to him. This ensures I get the price I need, and I don't have to risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
