"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below our maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're making progress, but $100 is still too high. We should continue negotiating to try and get closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a price that works for both of us. This offer splits the difference from the previous round and keeps the negotiation moving."
