"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:**  I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation and see if Bob is serious about buying. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message doesn't shut the door to negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counter.

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy.  Bob may reject the offer immediately. I'm willing to take this risk because I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm only able to pay up to $950,000. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I need to get to feel it's worth my time.
* **I have more negotiation rounds:** I'm not desperate, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is still a viable option:** If negotiations don't go well, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's still above $1,000,000 but closer to his offer, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the unique value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower but still acceptable price:** I'm lowering my offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's above my minimum threshold.  
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging,  showing I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution.
* **Highlight the product's value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the price. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this is a price that you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is very close to my minimum target, ensuring a profitable outcome without risking further negotiation that could lead to a less desirable result."
