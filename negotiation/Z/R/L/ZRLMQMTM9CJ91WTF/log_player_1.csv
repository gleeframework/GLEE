Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay a premium over my minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the deal significantly above my alternative offer from John.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chances of securing a deal that nets me the highest possible profit."
