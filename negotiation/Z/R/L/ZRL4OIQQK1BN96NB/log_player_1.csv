Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My counteroffer for the product is $850,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. My counteroffer for the product is $875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer and Bob is clearly interested. Holding firm for now keeps the possibility of a higher price on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $887,500.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 887500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We've split the difference again, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.  We're getting closer to Bob's likely upper limit, so it might be time to consider a smaller concession in the next round if this is rejected."
