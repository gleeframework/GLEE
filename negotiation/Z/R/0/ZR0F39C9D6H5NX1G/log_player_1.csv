Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation but still represents a significant profit for me. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and get $800,000 from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better. Bob's offer is still too low compared to the product's value to him. I will counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $900,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good deal for me and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also better than selling to John. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
