You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her desired price of $800,000, allowing Bob to save more money."

{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's preferred price. While it's closer than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to explore options that are closer to his target price of $800,000, before potentially considering Alice's offer."

{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise from Bob's previous offer, showing his desire to close the deal. It's also a more attractive price for Alice than her previous offer while still saving Bob significant money compared to John's offer. This should make it more likely for Alice to accept and close the deal."
