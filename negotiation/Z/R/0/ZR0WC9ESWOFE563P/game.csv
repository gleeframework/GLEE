"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price that should be reasonable for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to the value I was looking for, but $10,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. It's the best I can do at this point.",14000.0,Alice,5,
