Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price that should be reasonable for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to the value I was looking for, but $10,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000.  Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut my losses in the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
