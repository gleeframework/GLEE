"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $12,000 is below what I can accept. Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm willing to go to $12,500.  This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
