"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This is a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's product is worth $8,000 to her.
* Bob is offering $8,500, which is a good compromise.
* This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but closer to his initial counteroffer.
* Bob can likely negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer again.
* Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option if the negotiation with Alice fails, but it's not the most desirable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice rejected Bob's previous offer of $8,500, but she's willing to negotiate.
* This counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $9,700 and Bob's previous offer.
* It's a reasonable price point that might be acceptable to both parties, and it keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above his ideal price.
*  Bob is approaching his maximum budget and there is no guarantee Alice will budge further.
*  To avoid further negotiation, it is more strategic for Bob to buy from John for $12,000, ensuring he gets the product while limiting further potential losses in negotiation."
