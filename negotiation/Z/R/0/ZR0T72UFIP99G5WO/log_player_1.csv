Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering $900,000, I'm leaving some room for Bob to negotiate a price that's closer to his perceived value, while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive and confident tone:** I'm using a positive and confident tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Next steps:**

I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While $850,000 is less than my ideal, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, but still acknowledging his willingness to pay a bit more than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $850,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm still maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations moving forward. 

**Next steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. While your offer is getting closer, I'm only able to go up to $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:**  $825,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation unlikely to yield desired results:** It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price that's both acceptable to me and achievable for Bob.
* **Selling to John is the best option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit.

**Next steps:**

I'll move forward with selling the product to John, as it offers the most profitable and secure outcome for me."
