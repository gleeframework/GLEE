``` 

This offer starts with a price that is a bit above my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept. It also opens the conversation by acknowledging the value to him, which could be helpful in building rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe we can reach a higher price point. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better price within my acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference on our last offers and go with $1,087,500? This feels like a fair price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we settle on $1,080,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's only $80,000 less than my initial offer, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer will ensure a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or me having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
