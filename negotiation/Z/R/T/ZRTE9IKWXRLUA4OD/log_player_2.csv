"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm selling it for $90. It's worth a lot to me, but I know you'd get good use out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $80. If not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
