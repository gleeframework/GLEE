{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness in negotiating while still leaving room for compromise. Starting with a more aggressive offer can encourage Alice to lower her price sooner rather than later."

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still below my maximum budget. It signals that I'm willing to compromise but also shows that I'm not willing to overpay. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to make a final concession."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still higher than what I can get from John. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can get Alice to drop her price closer to $15,000 or even lower. I'm still within my negotiation limit and haven't exhausted all possibilities with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small counteroffer to show Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still pushing for a better price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept, as I'm now very close to my maximum budget."
