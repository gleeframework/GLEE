"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a bold opening offer, but I believe it's necessary to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can do better, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counter with a higher price and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $17,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant compromise from my initial price. This should show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to settle for anything significantly below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a higher price. I'm confident that I can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is a very small increase from my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm still comfortable selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. While we're getting close to a deal, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk losing more time. I'm confident that John will buy the product from me for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I will take the sure win and sell to John."
