""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this unique product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and what John is offering. It's too early to settle. I'll send a counteroffer.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is moving closer to my bottom line, but I still think there's room for negotiation. However, his latest offer is now higher than John's offer.  

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,300,000 guarantees a profit above my alternative option."
