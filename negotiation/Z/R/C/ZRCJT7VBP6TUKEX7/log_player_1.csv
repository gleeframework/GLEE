"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming for a bit higher than the product's value to him. This way, I leave room for negotiation and potentially earn more. I'm also highlighting the product's value to him, which may make him more inclined to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's already shown interest. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $825,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $750,000. I'm willing to pay $775,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a bit more. John is a solid backup option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my minimum price.  This reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $800,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $775,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his offer, and I've reached my minimum price.  I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk losing more time in negotiation. John is a guaranteed $800,000, so I'll take the deal with him."
