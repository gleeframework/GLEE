Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** Offering it at $14,000 shows Alice understands the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive (like starting at $14,500 or higher), which could turn him off."
