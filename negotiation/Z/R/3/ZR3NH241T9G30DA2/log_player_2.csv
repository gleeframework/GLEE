"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly to avoid losing the sale.  By rejecting her initial offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a better deal."
