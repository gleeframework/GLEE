"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that suits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, I can't quite meet that price point. I'd be willing to buy the product for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  To be realistic, I could go up to $750,000.  That represents a significant investment from my side, but I believe it's a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
