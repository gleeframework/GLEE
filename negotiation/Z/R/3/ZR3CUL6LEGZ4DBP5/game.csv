"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more compromise at $11,500. This price is still a good value for you considering the product's worth, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
