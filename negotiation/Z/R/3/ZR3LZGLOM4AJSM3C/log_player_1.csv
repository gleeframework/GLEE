Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, it's enough to secure a deal without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not confident I can push him higher.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000 to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
