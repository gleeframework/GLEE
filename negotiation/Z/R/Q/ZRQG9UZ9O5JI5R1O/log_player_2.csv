"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible and should use the negotiation rounds to his advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, given my budget constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal, but is still leaving room for Alice to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,875.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to maximize your profit, but $10,000 is still a little too high for me.

What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

* **Small Increment:** Bob is offering a small increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise but still pushing for a lower price.
