"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to him, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This signals his serious intention to buy but also demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for further negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This offer is a good balance between getting a lower price and not risking losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This offer is only $75,000 over his maximum price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation leading to a better deal is not worth it. It's better to secure the deal at a slightly higher price than to risk losing the opportunity entirely."
