"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a strong price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise considering your previous offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,5,
