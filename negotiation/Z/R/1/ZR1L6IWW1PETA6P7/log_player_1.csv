Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  This gives you a chance to acquire it at a price below its true worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it at $1,000,000. This presents a potential profit margin of $200,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the advantage Bob gains by purchasing it at this price,  potentially increasing his willingness to accept.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
