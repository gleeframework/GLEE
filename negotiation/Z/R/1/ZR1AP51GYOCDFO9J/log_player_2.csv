It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a lower price.  You have room to negotiate down from her offer of $1,200,000, and there's no reason to pay more than you need to."

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is only $100,000 more than John's offer. It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation may not be fruitful.  There's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and you risk ending up paying the same amount to John."
