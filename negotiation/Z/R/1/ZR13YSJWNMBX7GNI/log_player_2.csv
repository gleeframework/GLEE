# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
