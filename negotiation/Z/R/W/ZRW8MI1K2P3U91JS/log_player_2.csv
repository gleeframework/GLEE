"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice is expecting you to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and professional:** Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Signals interest:**  Shows you're serious about buying but not desperate.
* **Establishes a lower anchor:**  Puts a lower price point on the table, moving the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Doesn't go too low too quickly, allowing for back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we can still aim for a better price.  We're closer to a reasonable deal, but there's no need to rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges progress:**  Shows Alice that you recognize her price reduction and are willing to negotiate further.
* **Incremental steps:**  We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to a deal point.
* **Remains firm (but fair):** We're holding our ground without being overly aggressive. This shows Alice we're serious about the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. Let's compromise at $9,750. This is a final offer from me. If you're serious about buying, let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. Alice has come down significantly, and while we might be able to squeeze a little more out of the negotiation, it's getting riskier. This price is well below our alternative option ($12,000 from John) and saves us a significant amount."
