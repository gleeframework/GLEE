Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you subtly imply the product is worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" and ""starting price"" signal that you're willing to negotiate. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving the door open for Bob to engage in a back-and-forth discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and our initial offer. While his counter-offer acknowledges the product's value, there's still a considerable gap. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about negotiating a better deal and that we're not willing to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers. I believe it's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Stand Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate by lowering our price. However, the decrease is substantial enough to show we're flexible, but not so drastic that it suggests desperation. 
* **Reiterate Value:** By again mentioning the product's ""true value and potential,"" we remind Bob of the benefits, subtly pushing back against his lower valuation.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise between Bob's offer and our desired price, encouraging him to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant investment for me and represents the maximum I can realistically pay. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer matches our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we could try to push for more, Bob has signaled this is his maximum budget. Accepting now guarantees we make our desired profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
