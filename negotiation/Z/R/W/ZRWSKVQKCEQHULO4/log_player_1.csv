"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 for it."",
""product_price"": 160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price, I know John is willing to pay that amount without further negotiation.  To avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing, it's more efficient to sell to John immediately."
