,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $60 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $45. Can we meet in the middle at $52.50?",52.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $67.50?",67.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $59, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $64?",64.0,Alice,9,
