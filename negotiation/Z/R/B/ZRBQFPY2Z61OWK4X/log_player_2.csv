"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is under your $120 limit, you can try to get a better price. You know John will sell it for $120, so rejecting Alice's offer might push her to lower the price further."
