"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to move closer to my initial asking price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 remains a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This shows my commitment to closing the deal, but it's the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
