"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit.  The $1,400,000 offer is closer to Bob's perceived value than mine.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This price gives us space to negotiate down if needed, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Professional Tone:**  The message is framed positively to encourage a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my absolute minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a $200,000 gap between his offer and my initial ask. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** While selling to John is an option, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to move closer to my initial asking price."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I've met Bob halfway between his offer ($1,200,000) and my previous asking price ($1,400,000). 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce that I'm not willing to drastically lower the price. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 remains a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This shows my commitment to closing the deal, but it's the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his highest offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Securing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to reinvest the earnings sooner."
