"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still below my maximum budget.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 95}

I'm increasing my offer to $95. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price Alice should be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $105 is still a bit above my budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, at this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $100.  I've already spent a few rounds trying to get a better deal from Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll come down further."
