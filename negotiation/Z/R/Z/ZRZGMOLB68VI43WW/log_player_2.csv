The product is worth $100 to Alice, so we can likely get a better price than $120.  It's worth exploring counteroffers."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

$115 is still a good price for the product, considering it's worth $150 to me from John.  I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from Alice, so it's time to accept."
