Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message indicates I'm open to discussing the price. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept such a low price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, and John is a backup option at a price I'm comfortable with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $15,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so I'm not going to settle for anything less.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm willing to pay a little more.  But $14,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $13,750 for the product.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  While I appreciate your offer of $13,750, it's still not quite there for me.
