"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $15,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm willing to pay a little more.  But $14,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $13,750 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  While I appreciate your offer of $13,750, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round, as I have another interested buyer who's ready to purchase at my asking price.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,7,
