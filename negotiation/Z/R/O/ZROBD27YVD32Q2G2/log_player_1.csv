Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $119."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't miss out on a sale."
