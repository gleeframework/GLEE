"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still not in my best interest. Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a reasonable profit for me.  What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
