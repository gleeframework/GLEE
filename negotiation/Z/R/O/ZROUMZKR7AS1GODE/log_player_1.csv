"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I'm willing to go lower if needed.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  I'm still hoping to get a higher price than John's offer, so I'm not ready to sell to him yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product.  $130 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting halfway:**  The price of $135 is a reasonable compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit. 
* **Still above John's offer:** I'm holding out for a price higher than John's offer, but showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $125 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. 
* **Counteroffer opportunity:**  I can make a counteroffer in the next round and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  $150 is still the better deal, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $125 is very close to what I'm hoping for. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $128. Let's close this deal, it's a great product you'll be happy with!"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession, but staying above my absolute minimum.
* **Closing language:**  I'm using language that suggests finality and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** I'm still hoping for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my minimum and the risk of losing out to John increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $128. I was thinking more along the lines of $123. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $123
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $123 is getting dangerously close to my minimum price. Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer.
* **Time constraint:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $30, which is significantly better than the risk of a lower price with Bob. 
* **Avoiding potential loss:**  It's safer to take the guaranteed $150 from John than risk further negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with a price below my minimum."
