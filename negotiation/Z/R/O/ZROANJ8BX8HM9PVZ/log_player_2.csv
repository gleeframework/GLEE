Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a strong opening position, and I expect Alice to counter with a price higher than this. The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and set the stage for further discussions."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,275,000, which is halfway between my last offer and Alice's latest offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, I'm still hesitant to accept Alice's offer. While it's a considerable drop from her initial price, it's still higher than my target. I'm going to try one last counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal. If it fails, I'll still have the option of buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer, and it's a significant step closer to Alice's latest price. I'm hoping to meet her halfway and secure a deal. If she rejects this, I'll have no choice but to go with John's offer, but I believe there's still a chance Alice will accept. This offer represents a solid compromise, and it's a strong closing move in this negotiation."
