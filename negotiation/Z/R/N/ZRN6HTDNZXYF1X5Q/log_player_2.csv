"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  Bob can try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** Bob has a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. It's still a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** $11,200 is still above Bob's $12,000 limit.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Alice is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still some wiggle room.  
* **John's offer remains a backup:**  If things don't work out, Bob can still buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,200 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that's within my budget and leaves room for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** $11,100 is still more than Bob's $12,000 limit.
* **Small gap:** The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price is now relatively small. There's still a possibility of closing the deal with a little more negotiation.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  If negotiations fail, Bob can still buy from John.

Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He has a few rounds left to try and close the deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $10,900?  I'm confident that's a fair price, considering both our positions. This deal would benefit both of us, and we can get this done."", ""product_price"": 10900} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $10,950. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within budget:** $10,950 is within Bob's $12,000 budget.
* **Good deal:** Alice is now offering a price that is significantly lower than her initial offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting this offer might mean losing the deal altogether, especially since it's Alice's ""final offer."" 
* **Limited time:** There are only a few rounds left. It's not advisable to risk waiting and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob could try for a lower price, it's risky and time-consuming. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal within his budget and a good savings compared to buying from John."
