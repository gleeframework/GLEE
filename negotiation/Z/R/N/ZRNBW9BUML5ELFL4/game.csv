Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a deal that works. Let's make this happen!",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
