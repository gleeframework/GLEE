"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm starting the conversation with a friendly message to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product is ""fantastic"" and ""valuable"" to pique Bob's interest. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation from a strong position."
