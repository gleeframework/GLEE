Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you wanting to sell the product to me. However, $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going down to $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!
