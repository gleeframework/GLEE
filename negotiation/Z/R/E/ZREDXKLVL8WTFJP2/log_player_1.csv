I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  It's important to note that this is just the initial offer, and I'm willing to negotiate further depending on Bob's response. However, I won't go below my minimum value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to try to get closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that, but I'll be willing to negotiate further if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but I still believe I can get a good price. I'm willing to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm not going to go lower than $1,050,000."
