"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while still staying within his budget. He starts by offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for potential compromise. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than Bob's previous counteroffer of $1,050,000 and is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  It is now a good deal for Bob, and he should accept it to save money compared to buying from John."
