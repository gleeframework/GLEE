"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than Alice's minimum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a quick and smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but $850,000 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for less than $875,000. While Alice has lowered her price, there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation process open and allows Bob to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering $860,000. This price is a good balance between our desired outcomes, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might consider other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price or walk away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's showing signs of potentially walking away if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Close to Jhon's price:**  The offer of $880,000 is significantly lower than Jhon's price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from Jhon at a much higher price.

It's better for Bob to accept Alice's final offer and secure the product at a price lower than Jhon's, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
