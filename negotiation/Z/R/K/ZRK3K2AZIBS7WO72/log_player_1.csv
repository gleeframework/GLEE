"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, my budget for this purchase is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $8,000 to me, and Bob is offering the exact value, it's a good deal. There's no point in risking further negotiation for a higher price, especially with 8 rounds left.  The potential for more profit is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
