Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By mentioning a ""public listing,"" you subtly imply that Bob might miss out on a good deal if he declines. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he's completely turned off by the price, you can adjust accordingly knowing you have John as a backup."
