"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks great, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $11,625? This feels like a fair compromise.",11625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $11,300? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11300.0,Bob,6,
