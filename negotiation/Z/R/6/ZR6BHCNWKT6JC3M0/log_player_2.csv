"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose selling it to you for $120. This price reflects not only the product's value but also the opportunity to make a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $120, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
