,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $8,200. Would that work for you?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,200. How about we try $8,600? It's a bit higher than your target, but still a great deal for you.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for staying with me on this. While $8,600 is getting closer, I'm trying to stay closer to $8,200.  How about $8,400 and we have a deal?",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $8,400. How about we meet in the middle at $8,350? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",8350.0,Alice,7,
