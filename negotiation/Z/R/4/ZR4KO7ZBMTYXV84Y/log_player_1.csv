Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You don't explicitly know how much Bob values the product, only that it's worth $1,000,000 to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John offers your baseline, getting Bob to pay even slightly above his perceived value significantly increases your profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, a lower offer closer to $1,000,000 would increase the chance of a successful sale to Bob.  The optimal strategy depends on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a guaranteed sale versus potentially higher profit."
