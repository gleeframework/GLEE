{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high. It's in my best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still hesitant to accept. There's a good chance she might come down further, especially if she wants to close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but just slightly. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also starting to push for a more favorable price.  With limited rounds remaining, Alice might be more inclined to accept a price closer to my offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is very close to my maximum price and with limited rounds remaining, I want to ensure I secure the product.  There's a risk that she might not accept my next counteroffer, and then I would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
