"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to my target price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room. Let's make this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the best I can do for now.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $8,750 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $8,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this deal.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price. However, I'm not willing to go below $8,800. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you. I'm hoping we can close this deal before we run out of time. ",8800.0,Alice,7,
