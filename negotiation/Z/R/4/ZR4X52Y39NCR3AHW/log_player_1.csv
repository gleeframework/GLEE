Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value and would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits the product brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is pushing too hard on the price, and it's unlikely he'll come close to my minimum acceptable amount. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safer and more profitable option at this point."
