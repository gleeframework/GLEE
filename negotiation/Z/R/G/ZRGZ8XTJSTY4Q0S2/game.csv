"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valuable, and I believe it would be a fantastic investment for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit above my initial budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal. How about  $1,075,000 - it's a final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
