{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but still below my minimum price. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good outcome. I'm confident I can either reach a deal with Bob or walk away with the $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. While I want to make a deal,  I'm not willing to go that low. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
