Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind that I won't accept anything less than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
