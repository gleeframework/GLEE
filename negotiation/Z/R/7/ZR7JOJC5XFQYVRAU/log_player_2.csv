Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I can do $1,060,000, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle of that number, at $1,057,500. That's the best I can do.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,052,500, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,052,500 and $1,060,000, which would be $1,056,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,056,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,056,250
