"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $120. Considering its immense worth to you, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, she's offering the product at her own maximum value.  There's no potential for savings. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a better deal, even if you ultimately buy from John at the same price."
