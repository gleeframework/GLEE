"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. It reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our negotiation. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
