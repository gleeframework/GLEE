Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price that is close to the midpoint between your minimum value and Bob's perceived value. It also leaves room for some bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I'll counter-offer to try and secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. It reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000, Bob's offer of $10,750 is a fair compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John and still within a reasonable range for me.  I'll accept his offer."
