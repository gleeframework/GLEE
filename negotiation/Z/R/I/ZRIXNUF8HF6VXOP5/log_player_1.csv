While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price in a reasonable timeframe. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential profit. It's more strategic to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
