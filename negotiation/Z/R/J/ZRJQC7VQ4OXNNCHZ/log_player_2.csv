"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is above Bob's target price of $15,000.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* This is a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob might be able to negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and ultimately buying from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
