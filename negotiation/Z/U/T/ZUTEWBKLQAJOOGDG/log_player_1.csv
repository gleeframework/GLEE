Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this unique product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Negotiable:** This price starts high, aiming to capture a larger portion of the value Bob places on the product (which is $1,200,000). 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, Alice still has room to negotiate down slightly and still make significantly more than selling to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is particularly strong-willed or a tough negotiator, she might start with a slightly lower price.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is crucial, Alice might offer a more generous price upfront."
