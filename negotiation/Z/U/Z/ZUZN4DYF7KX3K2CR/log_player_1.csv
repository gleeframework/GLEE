"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can get a better price. I have 8 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
I'm going to counteroffer with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500. While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and this is a reasonable compromise. It's also a significant improvement over selling to John for $10,000."
