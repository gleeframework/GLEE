"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that this product is worth more than $1,250,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is closer to a fair price given the product's worth. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
