"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $13,000?  That's the highest I can go.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
