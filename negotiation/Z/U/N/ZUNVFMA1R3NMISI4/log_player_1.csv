Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if needed."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 allows for some negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Beat Bob's Valuation:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but it's still within a reasonable range for Alice to consider a potential counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback position with John. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired price."
