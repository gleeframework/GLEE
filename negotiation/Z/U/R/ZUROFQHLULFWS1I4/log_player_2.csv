"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This price allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than the price John is offering, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a price within his budget."
