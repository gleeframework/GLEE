Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to the product's value to me ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is high, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he might get a deal if he counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage to aim high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $119, but there's also a chance he'll reject it.  It's a calculated risk to aim high."
