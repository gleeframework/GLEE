Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price, I know John is willing to pay that amount without further negotiation. It makes more sense to proceed with the certain sale to John, avoiding potential delays or further haggling with Bob."
