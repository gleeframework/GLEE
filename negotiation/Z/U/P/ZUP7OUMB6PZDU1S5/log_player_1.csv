"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident I can negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a more reasonable price. While I could sell to John now for $150, I'm hoping to earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering the price to $125, which is still higher than my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at his initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with him.  While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm still hoping to get more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $110. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I still have some wiggle room.  I believe this price is fair and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, so I'll reject this offer and continue trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105,  making a final attempt to get Bob to meet me in the middle. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I'll have to reconsider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is finally within my acceptable range.  While I would have preferred more, with only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. I'm confident that I can't get a better deal with Bob, and John is offering a guaranteed $150.  It's time to close this deal."
