"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I understand you need to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is just not feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This gives you a good price while ensuring I can still make a fair return on my investment.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair return on your investment, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and the potential it holds for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I receive a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
