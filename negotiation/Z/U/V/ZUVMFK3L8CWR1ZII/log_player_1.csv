Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Maximizing profit:** This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price from Bob while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 

If Bob accepts this offer, you make a great profit. If he rejects it, you can always sell to John for your guaranteed $150."
