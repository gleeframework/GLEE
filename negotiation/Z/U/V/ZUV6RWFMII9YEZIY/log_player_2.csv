You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when you have a backup option like buying from John.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my strong interest in buying the product while also leaving room for negotiation. This price is still within my budget and might incentivize Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get her even closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise but still staying below my target price. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might convince Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing that I'm serious about buying the product. I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer, and I believe a price of $800,000 is fair for both of us. If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider buying from John, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to get it down to $800,000, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely.  Accepting her offer saves me $385,000 compared to buying from John."
