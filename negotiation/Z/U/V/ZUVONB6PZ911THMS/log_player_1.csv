"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000.  This is a significant premium over Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a solid fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's offer.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000. This is still a premium for Bob, but it's closer to my desired price and still higher than John's offer.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price and below John's offer. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,550,000.  This is still above John's offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I believe this is a strong offer that might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price and below John's offer.  Given that we are nearing the middle of our negotiations and there's a chance Bob will continue to reject my offers, I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product. It's a safe bet that guarantees me my minimum desired value and avoids further uncertainty."
