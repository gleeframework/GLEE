"Hi Alice,  $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own costs. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11250 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product and our desire to come to an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen.",11250.0,Alice,5,
