Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $850,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
