"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards the upper end of your desired range. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Not Too Greedy:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, asking for the full amount right away might seem unreasonable and discourage further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John's offer ($1,000,000), which gives us leverage and allows us to be firmer in our negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than our initial ask and still leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. We know he values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.  We'll counter in the next round to try and close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your initial offer, I believe the value this product brings to your business is closer to my initial proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've made a counteroffer that shows we're willing to move from our initial position, but not drastically. 
* **Strategic Concession:** The decrease of $75,000 is significant enough to demonstrate good faith but still keeps us firmly in the upper half of the potential profit margin.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** We're continuing to emphasize the value the product brings to Bob's business, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,262,500? This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly using a splitting-the-difference strategy, which is common in negotiations. However, accepting his offer now would leave a significant chunk of potential profit on the table. We are still above John's offer, giving us leverage to push a little further.  We'll make another counteroffer, aiming slightly above the midpoint between our last offer and his."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I also need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we settle at $1,295,000? This seems like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1295000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Negotiation:** We acknowledge Bob's attempt to find a middle ground but signal that we're not willing to simply split the difference. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our offer of $1,295,000 is slightly above the midpoint between his last offer ($1,262,500) and our previous offer ($1,325,000). 
* **Justified Compromise:**  We frame this offer as a ""fair compromise,"" reinforcing the idea that we are both moving towards a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we're now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, we want to maintain momentum towards closing the deal without dragging it out unnecessarily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still committed to this deal, but $1,295,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,275,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe we can finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to our previous counteroffer and represents a significant profit above our minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Deal Momentum:**  Accepting now capitalizes on the negotiating momentum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation further.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own inherent value.  Dragging it out for a potentially small increase in price isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of jeopardizing a favorable deal that is already on the table."
