"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your initial offer, I believe the value this product brings to your business is closer to my initial proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,262,500? This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1262500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm still committed to this deal, but $1,295,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,275,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe we can finalize this agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
