"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to counteroffer or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down in price, she's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to buy from John for a guaranteed price within his budget."
