"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
