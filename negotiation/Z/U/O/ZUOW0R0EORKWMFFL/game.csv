"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I have in mind. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $725,000? That would work much better for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $725,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $850,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value I have in mind, and it's a bit closer to my original offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm prepared to make my final offer at $775,000. This price reflects the upper limit of my budget.  I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about we meet at $1,000,000? It's a bit of a stretch for you, but it's the best I can do at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
