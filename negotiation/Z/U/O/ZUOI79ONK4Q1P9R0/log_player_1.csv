Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting close, but I can still try to get a bit more from Bob.  I'm not willing to go below $120 with him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I can go down to $115, but that's my absolute best offer. It's a steal for this product!"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's time to cut my losses with Bob.  He's unlikely to go above $105, and I'm not willing to go below $120.  John offers a guaranteed $120, so it's the best decision at this point."
