"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $140, knowing that the product is worth $150 to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, hinting at his potential gains.

This first offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation where we can both find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price of $120, but there's still room for improvement. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain some leverage and potentially secure a better price in the next round.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting his counteroffer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my initial $140, potentially getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. 

**Next Round:** I will aim for a price somewhere between $130 and $140, taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $135.  This would still be a good value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to drop my price too much.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that even at $135, it's a good deal. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** My message suggests that I'm not desperate to sell and am open to further negotiations, but not at a significantly lower price. 

**Next Round:** I will analyze Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I might consider a slight decrease, but only if necessary to avoid the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and can potentially get a better price.
* **Value to Bob:**  The product is still worth $150 to Bob, which means there's room for him to increase his offer.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John at this point would be a loss since I'm aiming for a higher price.

**Next Round:** I'll send a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $125 and $135. I'll try to find a compromise that allows me to earn more than selling to John, but also avoids risking a deadlock with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I understand your budget, but $125 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping to get.  Would you be willing to meet me at $130? This would still be a good value for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but lower than my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at too much of a loss.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that even at $130, it's still a good deal.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise, aiming for a price that's in the middle ground between our current positions.

**Next Round:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I might have to reconsider selling to John as the negotiation might be getting close to a deadlock."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $122 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of Deadlock:**  With only four rounds remaining,  the risk of a deadlock with Bob is high. If I reject his offer, he might become less willing to negotiate further, and I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Maximize Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $2, which is better than selling to John for $120. 

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at this point maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of a lost deal."
