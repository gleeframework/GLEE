"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept!",13500.0,Alice,5,
