"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the sense we might be at an impasse.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a significant compromise on my end.  If you're serious about making this deal, I encourage you to consider this offer.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
