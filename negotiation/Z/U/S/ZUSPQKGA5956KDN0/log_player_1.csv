Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100.  I believe it's worth significantly more, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so any price below that has the potential to be accepted.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $100 aims to maximize your profit. This leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant portion of the potential profit.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances risk and reward. Offering a price too close to $120 leaves little room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. Conversely, a price too close to $80 minimizes your potential profit."
