Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price slightly lower but still well above my minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at $800,000."
