Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise given the value I see in the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.

Bob's offer is exactly what I would get by selling to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to sell the product and avoid further negotiation."
