"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident this product will be worth more than that for you. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? This way, we both come out ahead.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This would give us both a fair deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 still undervalues the product for you. Let's meet at $890,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
