"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
* **Bob's Goal:** Bob wants to spend no more than $10,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget.

It's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John at $10,000, as it meets his price limit and avoids further negotiations with Alice."
