"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  It's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate further as she values the product at $10,000. Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that is still beneficial for Bob, as it's below his maximum price of $12,000. It also gives Alice some room to negotiate, as it is above her valuation of $10,000. This should encourage her to continue the negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, he can still potentially get a better price. Bob can continue to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to his target of $10,500. The risk of rejecting Alice's offer is minimal since Bob has the option to buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. This offer is still lower than Alice's current price of $11,700 but higher than his previous offer, showing a genuine attempt to reach a compromise. It also allows Alice some room to negotiate further if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice is steadily increasing her offer and getting closer to his maximum budget.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price for Bob.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice, saving him $200 compared to buying from John."
