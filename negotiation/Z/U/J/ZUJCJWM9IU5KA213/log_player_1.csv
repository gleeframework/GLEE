{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** We're in the final round, and I don't have any more negotiating power. 
* **Bob's final offer is still below my desired price:**  While $915,000 is better than his previous offers, it's not enough for me to feel comfortable with the deal. 
* **John provides a guaranteed sale:**  John is willing to pay $800,000, which is a solid price that will still allow me to make a significant profit.

Even though I wanted to get more from Bob, it's important to prioritize a successful sale.  Selling to John ensures I get a good return on the product without the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to no deal at all."
