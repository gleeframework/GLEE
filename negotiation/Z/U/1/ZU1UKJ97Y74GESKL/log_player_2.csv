"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $8,500.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut your losses with Alice and take John's offer."
