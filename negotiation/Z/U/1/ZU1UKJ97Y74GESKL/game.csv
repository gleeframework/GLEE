"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
