"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or stick with your backup plan, saving at least $500."
