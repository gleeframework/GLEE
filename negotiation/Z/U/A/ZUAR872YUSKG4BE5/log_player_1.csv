Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $750,000. This is a reasonable offer, considering the product's value to him, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $700,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll need to decide whether to accept it or not.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $700,000 and proceed to the next round, where I'll send him a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get closer to the product's true value of $800,000.

My next move will be to make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $700,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll aim to get closer to the product's true value of $800,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $725,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $725,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to him, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another counteroffer of $710,000. Since this is still lower than my initial offer and my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to accept it or not.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $710,000 and proceed to the next round, where I'll send him a new counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get closer to the product's true value of $800,000.

My next move will be to make another counteroffer to Bob."
