"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product description] for a price of $2000000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its value will far exceed your expectations.  Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value of [product description], and I believe it's a mutually beneficial solution.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price, or consider buying from John if you don't think Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in making this deal work.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to work within a specific budget.  $900000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1000000. This reflects the value of [product description] and provides a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but it's still a bit high. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and a reasonable price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $950000 is still too far below what the product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $975000.  This is a significant concession, and it's the last offer I can make. Let's seal this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than your desired price point. You have a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $960,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and reflects both of our needs.  Let's come to an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your persistence. While $960000 is still lower than my desired price point, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $965000. This reflects the true value of [product description] and offers a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have one round left, and Alice's offer is still above your desired price point. It's unlikely she'll go lower. Given that John is offering the same product for a price that's within your budget, it makes sense to buy from John and save the time and effort of negotiating further."
