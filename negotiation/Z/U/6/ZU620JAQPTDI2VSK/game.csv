"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it, and it's the maximum I can currently afford. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter your offer. We believe in the value of our product and would like to propose a price of $900,000. We hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that demonstrates my genuine interest in your product while remaining within my budget. Let's finalize this deal, as I'm confident this price is a win-win for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
