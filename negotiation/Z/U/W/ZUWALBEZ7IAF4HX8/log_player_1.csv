Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for some potential negotiation without you needing to go below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's close to John's offer:** This provides a clear benchmark for how much you're willing to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference one more time. How about $8,875? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $8,750, and that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that Bob wouldn't budge on his price, it's clear we're at an impasse.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,875, and he's not willing to go any higher than $8,750.  Rather than continue this back-and-forth, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
