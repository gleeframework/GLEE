Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a better price. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you are confident in the value of your product while leaving space for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the benefit of the deal.
* **Encouraging closure:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the sale."
