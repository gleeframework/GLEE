"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too close to that limit. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, $1,050,000 is still above your desired price range.
* **More negotiation is possible.** You can continue negotiating with Alice to try and get closer to your ideal price point of $900,000.  There's still room for a compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little higher than where I'd like to be. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.** Her offer of $1,020,000 is now within a reasonable range for you, especially considering your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation might not yield significant savings.**  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance that Alice will not come down much further.
* **Risk of losing the deal.** Continuing to reject offers risks losing Alice as a seller altogether, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $1,020,000 is the most prudent decision. It saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John, and the negotiation has already progressed sufficiently.**"
