Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above John's offer. 
* **Strong but Respectful:** The message aims to convey the product's value without being overly aggressive, increasing the chance of Bob accepting.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer (and accepting John's lower offer) with the potential to secure a much higher profit."
