"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be around $750,000. That's a fair offer, reflecting the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
