"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'd like to propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal compared to Alice's actual value of $120, you can do better. You're aiming to get the product for $80 or less, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $100 is a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for my efforts and the value of the product. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows us to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target of $80. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $87? This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you receive a fair price."", ""product_price"": 87} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After carefully considering your offer, I am willing to agree on a price of $88 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions and ensures that I receive a reasonable return for the product. I believe this will be satisfactory for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $88 is very close to your target, you're still paying more than you would from John. You have more rounds to negotiate, and you might be able to convince Alice to go lower.  Rejecting allows you to make a final counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  $88 is tempting, but I'm still a little over my limit.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is my absolute final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your final offer. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $86 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows me to cover costs while also ensuring you receive a competitive price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $86 is close to John's price, you've already established your absolute limit at $85.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice will accept your final offer. If not, you'll move to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $85 is my absolute final offer, as I've already explained. If you can't accept this, I'll have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 85}
