"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'd like to propose a price of $100 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $100 is a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for my efforts and the value of the product. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows us to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $87? This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you receive a fair price.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After carefully considering your offer, I am willing to agree on a price of $88 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions and ensures that I receive a reasonable return for the product. I believe this will be satisfactory for both parties.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  $88 is tempting, but I'm still a little over my limit.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is my absolute final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to look elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your final offer. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $86 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows me to cover costs while also ensuring you receive a competitive price for the product.",86.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $85 is my absolute final offer, as I've already explained. If you can't accept this, I'll have to move on to another seller.",85.0,Bob,8,
