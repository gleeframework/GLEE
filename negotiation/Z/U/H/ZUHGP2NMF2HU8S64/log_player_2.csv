"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth its weight in gold.  Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to keep your options open in case you can find a better deal elsewhere."
