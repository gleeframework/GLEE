"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1700000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, which is still a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1600000 but I'm still unable to go that high.  My final offer is $1550000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
