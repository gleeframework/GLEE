"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves me with a substantial profit. This allows room for negotiation and leaves Bob with some incentive to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to him.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially with multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired profit. I'm willing to take a slight risk and continue negotiating to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going back to Bob's previous offer.  Since we're nearing the halfway point, I want to show some flexibility and see if we can reach a deal. This also signals that I'm serious about closing the deal with him rather than going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, the negotiation is getting risky. Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm not sure I can push for a higher price in the remaining rounds. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John for $800,000. It's not ideal, but it's a safe and reasonable profit given the circumstances."
