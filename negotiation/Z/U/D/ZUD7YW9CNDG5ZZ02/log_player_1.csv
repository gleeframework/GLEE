{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I can reject his offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less.  $9,500 is a good deal for me, and it seems like Bob is serious about this price."
