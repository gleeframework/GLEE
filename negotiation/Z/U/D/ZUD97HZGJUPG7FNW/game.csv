"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a fair offer considering my budget and the fact that I could buy the same product from John for that price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $1000000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This price reflects the unique value of this product and would be a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
