"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $850,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product brings is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see we're both trying to find a good middle ground. While I appreciate the move to $920,000, it's still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and aim for $900,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
