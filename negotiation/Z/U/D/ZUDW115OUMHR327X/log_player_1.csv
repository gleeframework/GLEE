Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $800,000 is my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than what I believe the product is worth to me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for me to earn more than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it seems unlikely we will reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiation, I will sell to John for $800,000, which is my minimum value and secures a sale."
