Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price,  while still ensuring we get more than our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message positions the offer as a good deal, potentially making Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119.  He might try to negotiate lower, or he might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives us the best chance of maximizing profit while still ensuring a sale."
