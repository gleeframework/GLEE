"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth it to buy from Alice for $110 when you can get the same product from John for $80.  It's better to counteroffer Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

You're willing to pay the maximum you're comfortable with, hoping Alice will accept your offer to avoid losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $95 is still more than you're willing to pay, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $80. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
