Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that as possible while still being reasonable.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $110}

This is a decent price that's still below the maximum I'm willing to accept, but it's high enough to be attractive to Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $80. Since this is lower than my minimum price, I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer.

I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum price. Let's try to get closer to $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $95}

This offer is higher than Bob's offer, but still a bit lower than my minimum price. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $95}

This offer is higher than Bob's initial offer of $80, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to him. Let's see if he accepts or makes another counteroffer!"
