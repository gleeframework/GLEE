Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling that $1,050,000 is her bottom line. While we could try to negotiate further, it's risky. She might walk away, forcing us to buy from John at the much higher price of $1,500,000.  Accepting $1,050,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
