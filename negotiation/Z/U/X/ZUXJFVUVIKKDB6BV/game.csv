"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential value, $1,800,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,600,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair offer considering its worth to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget for this product is $1,500,000.  If you're able to work within that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your transparency, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,550,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
