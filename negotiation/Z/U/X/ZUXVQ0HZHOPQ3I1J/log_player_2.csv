{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high, and he has a better option with John.  He should see what kind of counter-offer he can get from Alice before moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still too high. He should try to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to his target price. If not, he can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than before, it's still significantly higher than his maximum price. He's already shown his willingness to negotiate, and John's offer is still a secure fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should increase his offer again, showing Alice he's willing to meet her halfway.  $10,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his commitment to buying the product. This is a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she's willing to meet him closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. Even though it's come down slightly, it's still too high for his budget.  He's got a comfortable backup with John, and he's already shown flexibility in his counteroffers. He's likely to be able to get a better price in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob should increase his offer again, but only slightly, showing Alice he's still determined to buy but won't go over his limit. This is a calculated risk, as he's close to his maximum price. However, if Alice accepts, he'll save $1,000 compared to John's offer.  If Alice rejects, he can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still higher than his maximum price, and he only has one round left.  He's shown he's willing to negotiate, but there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. It's safer to go with John's offer and secure the product within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```
