"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $150? I'm really interested in this item, but I'm sticking to my budget.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $165, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $155. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $160. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
