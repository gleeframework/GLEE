Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.  This makes him more likely to see the offer as a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for more than my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  I'll also need to consider how long I want to keep negotiating with Bob before selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Fair:**  Bob's offer is exactly the product's minimum value to me.  While I would have preferred more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in subsequent rounds. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting time, which could prevent me from pursuing other opportunities. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John is also willing to pay $10,000, there's no guarantee he will remain interested if I take too long to finalize the deal with Bob. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is preferable to the uncertainty of further negotiation or the potential risk of losing John as a buyer."
