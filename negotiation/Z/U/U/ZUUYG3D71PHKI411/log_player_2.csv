"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, so he shouldn't accept $120.  Rejecting allows him to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $98. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $98 is still above Bob's desired price of $80.  Since they are down to the last few rounds, Bob should go ahead and buy the product from John for $80.  He's already gotten a better price from John than he's likely to get from Alice, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept his counteroffer."
