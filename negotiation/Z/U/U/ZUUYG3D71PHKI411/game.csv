"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's close this deal!",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",90.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $98. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",98.0,Alice,7,
