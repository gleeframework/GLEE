"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $1000000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $910000. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $910,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there is a chance that further negotiation might bring the price down, it's risky. Bob can secure the product from John for his maximum budget, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases."
