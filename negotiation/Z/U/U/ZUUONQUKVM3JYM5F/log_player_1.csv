Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of such caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and that you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows you to aim significantly higher.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer ($2,250,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.  Even if he negotiates down, it's unlikely he'll go as low as your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confidence:** The language used is confident and emphasizes the product's value, further justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, you might adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
