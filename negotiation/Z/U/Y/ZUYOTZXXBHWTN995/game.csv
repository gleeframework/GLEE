"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit high at $9,500.  Would you consider $9,000? That's closer to my budget and might make the deal possible.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This is a good compromise that leaves us both happy.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,125?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9125.0,Bob,6,
