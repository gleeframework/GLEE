"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer that reflects the product's true value to you. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give me valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($800,000). This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Accepting $900,000 would mean leaving $100,000 on the table compared to John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By rejecting and countering, I can try to nudge Bob closer to a price point that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While the product is incredibly valuable at $1,000,000, I'm willing to be a bit flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $975,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $25,000, which shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still positions me well above his initial offer.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and my attempt to meet Bob halfway, I'm subtly anchoring the price point at a higher level.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  This counter-offer still ensures a significant profit margin compared to selling to John, keeping the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's counter-offer only moved down $25,000, indicating his increments are getting smaller. This suggests he's getting closer to his maximum price. 
* **Time as Leverage:** We still have several rounds left. By continuing to negotiate, I can increase the pressure on Bob, especially as we get closer to the end of our discussions. 
* **John Remains an Option:** My safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 allows me to maintain a strong position and avoid accepting a less favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $962,500?  This price represents a fair compromise and ensures you get this valuable product."",
""product_price"": 962500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  By splitting the difference, I'm signaling a willingness to close the deal quickly, which can encourage Bob to act sooner.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While a compromise, this price is still significantly closer to my initial offer than Bob's, reinforcing the value of the product.
* **Limited Rounds:**  As we approach the halfway point of the negotiation, applying a bit more pressure by narrowing the gap can be an effective tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering the value of the product and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $955,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concessions:** Bob is clearly trying to wear me down with small incremental increases. His latest offer is only a $2,500 increase, indicating he's nearing his limit.
* **Time Advantage:** Time is on my side, and I'm willing to bet Bob values getting the deal done more than those extra few thousand dollars. 
* **The John Factor:** My alternative offer of $1,000,000 acts as a strong anchor.  I'm not afraid to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he's unwilling to meet me closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're running out of time to make this deal happen. I'm confident this product will greatly benefit your business, and I'm willing to make one final offer: $960,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 960000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Urgency:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and conveying that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Slight Concession:** The $2,500 decrease from my previous offer is a small concession to show a willingness to find middle ground, but it keeps the price firmly above $955,000. 
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the benefits he'd be missing if he doesn't take the offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds remaining, Bob will feel the pressure to either accept this strong offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final offer, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $957,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $957,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $957,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is clearly unwilling to budge significantly from his valuations.  His incremental increases are now negligible, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a substantial increase.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Each round spent negotiating with Bob is a round I can't spend exploring other opportunities or closing the guaranteed deal with John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer represents a guaranteed $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to haggle with Bob for a relatively small potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing both deals. 

**It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John.**"
