"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than what the product is worth to me, but not so high that Bob will automatically reject it. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum value for the product. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's less than what he's willing to pay, but it's also above my minimum value for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250} 
```

This is my final offer. It's still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to compromise.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, I'm still getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
