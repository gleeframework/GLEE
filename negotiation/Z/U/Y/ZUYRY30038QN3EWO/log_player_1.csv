Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Given the product's worth to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $875,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still nets a $75,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":**  His language suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and lost opportunities with other buyers."
