"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we settle at $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $12,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  Would you be willing to consider $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
