"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal considering the value it holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,130,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1130000.0,Alice,5,
