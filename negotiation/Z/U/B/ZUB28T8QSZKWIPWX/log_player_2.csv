"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, so it's better to try and get a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price of $1,000,000. You still have 7 rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. It's possible you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,130,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,130,000 is getting closer to your target price of $1,000,000.  You've already rejected a few offers and have 5 rounds remaining. At this point, it's worth considering accepting the offer.  

* **Pros:** You're saving a significant amount compared to buying from John ($1,500,000).
* **Cons:** You're still paying more than your ideal price, but you're likely not going to get a much lower offer.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer seems like the best move at this point in the negotiation."
