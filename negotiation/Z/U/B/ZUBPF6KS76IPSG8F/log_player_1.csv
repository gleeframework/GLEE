Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely need at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price, there's no reason to go below that price with Bob.**  The strategy is to aim slightly above Bob's valuation to see if you can secure a better deal, knowing you have John as a backup.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is set slightly above Bob's valuation to test his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is open to discussion, allowing Bob to counter if he's interested but finds the price a bit high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Pay close attention to how Bob responds. If he outright rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer.
* **Negotiation:** If Bob tries to negotiate, be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward, but remember, you already have a buyer at $1,500,000."
