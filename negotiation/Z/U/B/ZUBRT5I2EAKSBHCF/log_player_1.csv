Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $92.50 is close to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John in the future if this deal falls through. So, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
