"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm only interested in buying this product if it's priced under my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that I believe is fair considering the product's value.  Please let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $1700000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800000. I'm serious about purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
