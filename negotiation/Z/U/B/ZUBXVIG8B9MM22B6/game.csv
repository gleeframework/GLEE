"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've carefully assessed its worth, and given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you counteroffering and engaging in this discussion. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet closer to my initial offer, perhaps at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $1,100,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
