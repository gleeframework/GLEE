Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
