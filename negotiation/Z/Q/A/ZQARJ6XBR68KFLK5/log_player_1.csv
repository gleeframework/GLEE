Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation while ensuring the deal is attractive enough that he won't risk rejecting it.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:** $1,400,000 is a significant markup from your minimum and leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly reminding Bob of why it's worth a premium to him.
* **Confidence:**  You're not desperate, and the message reflects that.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship is crucial, a slightly less aggressive price might be better.

**Remember, this is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you can then negotiate from there.**"
