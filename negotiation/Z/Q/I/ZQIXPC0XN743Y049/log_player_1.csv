{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $125. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a compromise considering Bob's initial counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation, as I can get my minimum price from John right now."
