"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price of $1,500,000.  This sets a strong initial expectation and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Value Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, it's important to start high and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Plan B:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob stall or fall below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  While Bob's offer is low, it does provide an indication that he is interested in the product. This gives me room to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a solid backup option, but I'd prefer to try and get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $1,200,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a decent profit margin. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate.  If he's truly interested in the product, he might be willing to meet me closer to the middle ground.
* **John's Offer:**  Remember, John's offer of $1,000,000 is still a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Still Too Low:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a loss on this valuable product.
* **Moving Closer:**  Bob's offer has moved closer to my desired price, which is a positive sign. It indicates he's serious about the deal and we might be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with further negotiations.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good option, but I'm still holding out hope for a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price closer to Bob's last offer, aiming to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm proposing $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's latest offer of $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind. 
* **Closing the Deal:** This counteroffer is only $50,000 above John's offer.  I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept, as he's shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is still a viable backup option, I'm optimistic that I can secure a slightly higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and ending up with John's offer is high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation uncertainty.

**Conclusion:** It's time to take the guaranteed profit and sell the product to John.  The risk of further negotiations not yielding a better price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer from Bob."
