Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm happy to discuss it further, but if we can't agree on a price closer to this, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and not risk further negotiation with Alice."
