"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm happy to discuss it further, but if we can't agree on a price closer to this, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",8500.0,Alice,5,
