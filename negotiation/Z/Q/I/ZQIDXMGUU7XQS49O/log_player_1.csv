{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for both of us to encourage a positive response.
* **Open-ended:** The message is open-ended to allow for Bob to counter without feeling pressured. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for less than $1,200,000, as I have a backup buyer. 
* I'll gauge Bob's interest and counteroffers to see if there's a chance to close a deal above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have the leverage to counter and potentially secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, starting closer to my desired price but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about $950,000?  This would allow me to make this deal work while still offering you a good price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the ""good price"" aspect for Bob to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Bridge the gap:** I'm using language like ""bridge the gap"" to suggest that we're close to a deal and encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum while also being reasonable for Bob.
* **Testing the waters:** I'm gauging Bob's response to see if he's willing to move closer to my price or if he'll reject again. 
* **Ready to walk away:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $925,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is slightly closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore a few more rounds before resorting to selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer again:** I'll make another counteroffer, possibly aiming for a price closer to $950,000 or slightly higher, to see if I can push Bob further towards my desired price.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Bob is serious about making a deal or if he's just trying to lowball me.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer again, I'm reminding him that I have a backup buyer and am not desperate to sell at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this work.  Let's split the difference and go with $937,500.  I believe this is a fair price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By offering $937,500, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($925,000) and my previous offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying relatively close to my target.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and equity. 
* **Respecting both needs:**  I highlight the fact that this price addresses both of our needs, reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to see if Bob is genuinely interested in a deal closer to my desired price. 
* **Prepared for a final decision:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll be prepared to either accept his offer if it's close enough to my minimum or move on to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While I'm still not at my ideal price, I'm trying to minimize the risk of losing a potential sale without sacrificing too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. In light of this, I am willing to consider $930,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is only $7,500 away from my previous counter, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation exhaustion:**  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $1,200,000, ensuring a much better outcome than accepting Bob's final offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving on:**  I've reached the point where further negotiation is unlikely to produce a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Minimizing risk and maximizing profit:**  Selling to John provides a secure and lucrative solution, minimizing the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
