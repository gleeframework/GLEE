Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  $925,000 represents a significant profit for you while still being a good deal for Bob compared to his perceived value.

This strategy aims for a win-win scenario where both parties feel satisfied with the outcome."
