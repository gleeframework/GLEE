Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll recognize the worth of this investment."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** The $2,000,000 offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. This gives you the opportunity to potentially reach a price higher than your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. However, setting the price too high might lead to Bob immediately rejecting the offer.  You'll need to weigh the risk and potential reward based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
