"Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm not comfortable with the price yet.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I respect that.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible here.  I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking $1,150,000 was a bit too high, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
