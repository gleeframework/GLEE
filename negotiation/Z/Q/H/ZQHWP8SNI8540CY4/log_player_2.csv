Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more.  I'm willing to pay a little more than my absolute limit, but still significantly less than her last offer."

I'm willing to pay a little more than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to stay under my limit. Hopefully, Alice is starting to see that I'm serious about wanting to buy the product, and she'll come down a bit more."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000. While I would have liked to get a lower price, it seems like Alice is not willing to budge. I'm not willing to risk continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the product altogether."
