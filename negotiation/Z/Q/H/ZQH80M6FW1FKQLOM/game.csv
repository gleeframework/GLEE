"Bob, I believe this product is of great value to you, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. My asking price is $1200000. This leaves ample room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a profit.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us while still respecting your budget.  Let me know your thoughts on this revised offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
