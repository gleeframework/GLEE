"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is intriguing, but $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $16,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can get a lower price. Bob can still buy from John for $15,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's higher than he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'll counter with $16,250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's wiser for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum price of $15,000, rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price or losing the opportunity completely."
