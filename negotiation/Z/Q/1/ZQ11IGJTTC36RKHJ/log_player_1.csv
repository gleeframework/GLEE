Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a little more than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'll try to get closer to $100 by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this is close enough to entice him but still leaves a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $2 less than my last counteroffer, and it's closer to my desired price of $100. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations and ensure a decent profit."
