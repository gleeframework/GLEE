Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it still represents a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the risk of continuing negotiations.  There's a chance that Bob could walk away, or that I could end up selling to John for a lower price.  $920,000 is a good compromise."
