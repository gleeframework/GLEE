"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can finalize the details.  If you decide to pass, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's perceived value of the product. Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is his maximum price point.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
