"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $90 is more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
