Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price, demonstrating your value for the product, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting lower, and while I could keep negotiating, it's getting increasingly likely he'll stall or keep reducing the price.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
