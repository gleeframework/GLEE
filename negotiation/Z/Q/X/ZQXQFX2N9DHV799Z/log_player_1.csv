{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  This is a great deal, as the product is worth at least $12,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good compromise between your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you'll make a profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is right at the edge of what I'm willing to accept. While I would prefer more, it's better than my minimum and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the sale to John.  I'll take it!"
