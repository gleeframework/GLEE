Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** You need at least $10,000, so I'm adding a buffer to try and get more.
* **Risk and reward:** Offering $12,000 means Bob has a potential incentive to buy, but you still have a guaranteed $10,000 backup with John.

This approach balances maximizing your potential profit with minimizing your risk."
