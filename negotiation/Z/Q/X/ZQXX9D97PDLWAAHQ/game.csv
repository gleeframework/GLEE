"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but I think $750,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price considering its value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $640,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to me.",640000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $640,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",675000.0,Alice,5,
