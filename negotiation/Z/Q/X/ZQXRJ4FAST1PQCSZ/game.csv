"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, and this price is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $900,000 is out of my budget range. Could you possibly lower the price to $875,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  Let's try $890,000. This is a very small step closer to your offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement in this round.",890000.0,Alice,5,
