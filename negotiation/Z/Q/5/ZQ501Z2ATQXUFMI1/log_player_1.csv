"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the product's value to potentially sway Bob.

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he'll immediately reject. This will give me a better understanding of his negotiating style and how much I can potentially squeeze out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob is interested in the product, there's room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a price closer to my value, or even close the deal with John if negotiations fail.

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price. However, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the deal doesn't work out in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is my absolute lowest. This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows flexibility while maintaining my bargaining position.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the great deal he's getting.
* **Setting a firm bottom line:** I'm stating that $11,000 is my absolute minimum. This gives Bob a clear understanding of my limits and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and the compromise I've made. If he rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate my options and consider either making a final counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my previous counteroffer.
* **The negotiation isn't moving forward:**  Bob is showing a reluctance to come up on price, and his offers are getting closer to his perceived value, not mine.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already at Round 4, and I'm running the risk of missing out on a better deal with John.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round. If Bob doesn't accept, I will sell to John to guarantee a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not seeing eye to eye on price, but I'm willing to make one final concession. $10,500 is my absolute final offer. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm signaling that I'm serious and willing to make a compromise, but I won't go lower.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by mentioning that I'll have to move on if he declines. This might encourage Bob to accept before the opportunity passes.
* **Remaining firm:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still holding onto a significant profit margin. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a price far below my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This is my final attempt at negotiation with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer and close the deal. I'm hoping that the pressure of a final offer and the possibility of losing the deal will sway Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,000, so I'll offer $9,750 for the product. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even though Bob is offering more than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiations are stalled:** We're at Round 6, and Bob hasn't shown a willingness to reach my minimum price point. It's likely that further negotiations will only prolong the process. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's the best course of action given the current situation. I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, who doesn't seem interested in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
