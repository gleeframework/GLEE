"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my perceived value of the product ($150) while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message implies a willingness to negotiate, which is important to avoid a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum value, but it's still below where I'd like to be. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding the ""Jhon"" safety net:** While $80 is guaranteed, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to reinforce his motivation to close the deal. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited negotiation room:** I've already lowered my price significantly, and further concessions may be unlikely.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away completely, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John. 

It's a good deal, and the potential loss of the sale makes accepting the offer the safest option."
