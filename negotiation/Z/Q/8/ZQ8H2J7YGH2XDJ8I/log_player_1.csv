Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. That's my final offer.

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to my valuation, Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is acceptable. It's a significant profit above John's standing offer. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely."
