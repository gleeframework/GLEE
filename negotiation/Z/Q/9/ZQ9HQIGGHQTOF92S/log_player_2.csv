"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering I value the product at $12,000, and it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $8,500 is significantly less than Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* **It's a good deal compared to John:**  $8,500 is a much better deal than buying from John at $12,000. 
* **Limited rounds:**  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice raising her price.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at this point secures a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
