"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering I value the product at $12,000, and it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
