{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm offering $175. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is only $10 below my initial asking price and is still well above my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
