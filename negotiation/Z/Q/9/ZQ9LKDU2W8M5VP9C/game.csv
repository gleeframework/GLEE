"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000 is too low, but $1,200,000 is a sweet spot for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
