"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's minimum value.  There's room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  There's also the risk that if we accept this offer, we might realize later that we could have gotten it for even less.  It's better to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price, while still staying within my budget. This strategy aims to push Alice towards a more favorable price for me, while also demonstrating my serious interest in purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's still below my initial valuation of $15,000 and allows me to save a significant amount compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the product to another buyer and ensures a good deal for me."
