"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
