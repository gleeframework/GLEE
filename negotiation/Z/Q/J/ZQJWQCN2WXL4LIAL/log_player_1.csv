Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $12,000?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $12,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. John's offer is a good safety net, but securing a deal now is preferable.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal quickly allows me to allocate my time and resources to other opportunities."
