"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a profit and gives you a fair price. Let's see if we can agree on this!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
