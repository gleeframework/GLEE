Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly more than what the product is worth to me, but still potentially attractive to Bob since it's less than what it's worth to him. 

I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While it's still more than the product is worth to me, I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still higher than what the product is worth to me, but closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm starting to feel pressure to make a deal,  $950,000 is not enough for me. I'm going to risk it and try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept and what John is willing to pay. I hope Bob will see this as a fair price and finally agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure if he's going to budge further. It's better to be safe and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a good price and guarantees a sale."
