"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $140. I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and your appreciation for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is lower than Alice's value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better accommodate your budget while still reflecting the product's true value, I am now offering the premium product at $135. I hope this revised price allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $135 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the premium product at $132. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between the product's value and your budget constraints. I believe this is the best we can do to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price of $120. Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $120, it's a better strategy to take that option now.  Continuing the negotiation with Alice carries the risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, leaving Bob with no product and potentially a lower price from John."
