"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the pitch, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested, but only if I can make it work within my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $14,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair offer considering we're both making a concession.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is a bit closer to your budget. I think it's a great compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you consider $12,250? That's a firm offer from my side.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! $12,250 is a great offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,250 and $13,000, which is $12,625. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",12625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really tough!  I respect that.  I'm willing to stretch my budget one last time.  How about $12,400, and we close this deal?",12400.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is just $100 more than your last offer. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to call it a deal.",12500.0,Alice,9,
