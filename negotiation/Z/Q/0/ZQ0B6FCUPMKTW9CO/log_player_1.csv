Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if there's any wiggle room with Bob. If he rejects, I can then use John's offer as a fallback and adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing negotiations with Bob. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit while staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my desired minimum of $1,000,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my target, accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and secure a good profit. There's always a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob, so it's best to take this good deal."
