"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my price range.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8750 for the product. It's a fair price, and it's the highest I can go. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8750 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8900. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8900 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm ready to pay $8250 for the product, and this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere. ",8250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I've already compromised a lot to get to $8900. I'm willing to make one more small concession and offer the product to you for $8800. This is the absolute lowest I can go and still make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8800.0,Alice,7,
