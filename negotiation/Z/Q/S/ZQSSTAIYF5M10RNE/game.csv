"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects the unique benefits you'll gain from this product, while still allowing you a comfortable profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firm stance. Let's try to find a final solution. I'm willing to go down to $960,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our positions.  Let's close this deal.",960000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I'm still not comfortable with $960,000. I can do $955,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",955000.0,Bob,6,
