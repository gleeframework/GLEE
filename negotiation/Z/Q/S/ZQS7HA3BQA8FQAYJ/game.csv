"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is already a steal for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170? ",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $170 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $120. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go lower than $140.  This is my final offer, as John's deal is looking very appealing right now.",140.0,Alice,5,
