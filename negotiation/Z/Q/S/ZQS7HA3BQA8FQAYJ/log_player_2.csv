{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $200 is way above your maximum budget of $100.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is already a steal for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $170 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $100. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $170 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $120. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go lower than $140.  This is my final offer, as John's deal is looking very appealing right now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $140 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and you risk wasting time.  John's offer of $100 is the best option to get the product within your budget."
