"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $200. I think it's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get more than $150, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing or having to sell to John for the same price."
