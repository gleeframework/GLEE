"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to meet you in the middle and propose a price of $850,000. This is a bit closer to the original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
