It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can always buy it from John for $10,000."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but still above my budget. It's better to buy from John at $10,000 than risk further negotiation."
