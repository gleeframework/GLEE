I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects its true value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

This offer starts with a friendly and positive approach, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. It offers a price that is below Bob's estimated value but still allows for a significant profit for Alice. This strategy aims to secure a deal quickly while also leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit, I'm aiming for more. Bob is clearly interested, so I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,125,000 to reflect the true value of this product. It's a fair price that still leaves us both with a positive outcome. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1120000. Can we meet in the middle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal!  While it's not the absolute highest I could get, it's very close to my desired price and would be a significant profit. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
