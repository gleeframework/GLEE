"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair price considering its value. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $13,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still not a price I can accept. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at this price.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $13,750. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",13750.0,Bob,6,
