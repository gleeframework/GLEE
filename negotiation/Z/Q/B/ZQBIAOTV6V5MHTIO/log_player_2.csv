# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. I know it's worth $12000 to you, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than Alice originally wanted, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. He can get the product for a better price from John."
