"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $85 is still a good deal and better than selling to John for $80.  The risk of further negotiation is too high as it could lead to a lower price or a missed deal entirely."
