Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum. This is a strategic move, as it allows me to potentially secure a high profit. However, I'm open to negotiation and will adjust my price based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and either accept it or make a counter-counteroffer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll move on to John and secure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a decent profit for me. I believe this is a fair price that will likely entice Bob to accept the offer.  If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John, as my minimum profit is guaranteed there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him.  Considering the time and energy spent negotiating, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's guaranteed to get me my minimum profit, and I can move on to other business opportunities."
