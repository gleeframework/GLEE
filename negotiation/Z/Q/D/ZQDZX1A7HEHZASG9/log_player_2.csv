"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, but I have to be mindful of my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's value to her, you can get the product for an even better price from John ($1,000,000).  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves the best outcome."
