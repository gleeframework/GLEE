"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $140 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than Alice's initial price ($140) to leave room for negotiation. This tactic aims to move the price closer to our ideal range.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Clear Goal:** Our message explicitly states our target price, giving Alice a clear understanding of our expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is only $5 more than our ideal price from John. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make us lose the deal. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the product altogether."
