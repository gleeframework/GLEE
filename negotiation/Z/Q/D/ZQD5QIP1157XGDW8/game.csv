"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects that value.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
