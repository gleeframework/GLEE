"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point that is above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a good deal since he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $9,500. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a profit above my minimum price."
