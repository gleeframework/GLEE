"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground.  Offering $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Alice needs to make a profit. This also shows Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the possibility of running out of rounds makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
