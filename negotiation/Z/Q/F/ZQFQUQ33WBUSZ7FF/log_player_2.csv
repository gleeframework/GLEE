"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think you'll find this a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is too close to his maximum budget.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $9,000 is still above his desired price point. He'll try to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $8,750? I think that's a fair price that would benefit us both."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. My final offer is $8,875. This reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price and represents my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's final offer of $8,875 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000, making it a good deal.
* **Potential Loss:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice walking away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a better price, especially considering Alice's ""absolute bottom line"" statement.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a good price."
