"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,3,
