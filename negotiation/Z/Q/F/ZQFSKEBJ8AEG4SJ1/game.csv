"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,550,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number. Would you consider $2,000,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while finding a middle ground.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value you've stated while also staying within my financial constraints.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
