"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's target price of $1,200,000. While it's lower than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $750,000?  I believe this price is fair, considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This creates a negotiation window.
* **Message Tone:**  The message is polite and expresses a willingness to negotiate.  It also highlights the shared value of the product. 
* **Strategic Approach:** By offering a lower price, Bob is pushing Alice to compromise while demonstrating his serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial offer of $900,000 to $850,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and signals that she is motivated to close the deal. 
* **Value for Bob:** While $850,000 is still above Bob's desired price point, it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial saving.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Pushing for a lower price could risk losing the deal entirely.  Alice may not be willing to budge further, and Bob could end up with no product. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $850,000 is the most logical decision. It secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, while mitigating the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the product altogether."
