"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's inherent value and my desire to establish a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000. This offer reflects my genuine interest and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price acknowledges your interest and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob has a better option of buying the product from John for $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still keen on getting this product, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is now the same as what John is selling for.  At this point, Bob has no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice.  There is no advantage to continuing with Alice since there's a guarantee with John at the same price."
