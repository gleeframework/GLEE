``` 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions me as being willing to compromise, which could lead to a faster agreement.  I'm confident this price is attractive to Bob while still securing me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,000,000? This gives us both a good deal and ensures a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I believe I can push for a higher price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm offering, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $800,000 and secures a decent profit. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
