"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would cost Bob significantly more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm offering, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob can still potentially save more money by making another counteroffer. Buying from John would be much more expensive."
