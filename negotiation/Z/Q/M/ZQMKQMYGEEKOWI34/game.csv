"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,000,000? This gives us both a good deal and ensures a smooth transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm offering, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
