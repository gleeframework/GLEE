Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $95, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:** $95 is also within a reasonable range considering my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the product's appeal to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and allowing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate. I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Opportunity for a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $90, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I get a profit.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially finalize the sale with Bob without resorting to further negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** John is a sure thing.  He's willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Limited potential for higher price:** I've already negotiated with Bob, and his counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly higher price in future rounds.

With a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum price, I'm choosing to avoid further negotiation with Bob and secure the sale."
