"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its high value and potential, I believe a price of $13,500 is fair. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last price - $9,250?  This feels like a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  I could maybe do $8,500, but that's really pushing my budget.",8500.0,Bob,6,
