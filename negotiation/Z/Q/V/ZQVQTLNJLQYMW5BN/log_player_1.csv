Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than what you'd get from John, but leaves room for negotiation. Bob has a strong incentive to accept, as he'd still make a $300,000 profit. It's a fair offer that maximizes your chances of getting a good price while also acknowledging Bob's value for the product."
