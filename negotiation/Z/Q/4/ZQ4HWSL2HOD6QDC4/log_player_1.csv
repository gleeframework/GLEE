"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $13,000 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
