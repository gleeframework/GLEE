"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's fair to propose a price of $11,500 for this exceptional item. This offer is valid for the next round, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest in it, I am willing to accept $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer for this round. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now lower than John's price.**  This means buying from Alice is now the better financial decision, even though it's still above Bob's ideal price.
* **The negotiation is progressing.**  While a counteroffer could potentially get the price down further, it risks losing the deal entirely if Alice decides to stick to her offer. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 7 rounds remaining, it's prudent to lock in a deal that's better than John's price before time runs out."
