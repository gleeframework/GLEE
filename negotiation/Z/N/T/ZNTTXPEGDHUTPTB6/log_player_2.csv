"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is offering it at that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no need to negotiate with Alice if I can get the product for my maximum price immediately."
