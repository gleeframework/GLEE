Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, ensuring a potentially higher final price.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, increasing the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000. Starting with a strong offer and leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially secure a better deal without risking losing Bob as a buyer. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to counter further or sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's better than selling to John, it doesn't represent a fair value considering the product's worth to him. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price and will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product provides to your business. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not willing to go lower."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a compromise but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns but firmly state my price floor. I emphasize the value proposition, hoping to persuade him to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer maintains my negotiating leverage. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to go lower or sell to John.  However, I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $900000. Would you consider $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than what I would get from John and is closer to my desired price point.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether and potentially ending up with the lower price from John. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and a successful negotiation."
