"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while also being reasonable considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to a more reasonable price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to $1,000,000. You can counteroffer again and see if Alice is willing to budge further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,025,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,075,000.  While this is closer to your budget than her previous offers, it's still above your limit.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as it's unlikely she'll come down any further. You have a guaranteed price from John, so it's best to take the deal with him and save the time and effort."
