Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($150), there's no incentive to offer it to Bob for less.
* **Starting High:** By starting at your desired price, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is clear and concise, stating your price expectation upfront. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit. You can always negotiate later if Bob shows interest but finds the price too high."
