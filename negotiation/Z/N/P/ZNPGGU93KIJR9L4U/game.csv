"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs.",10500.0,Alice,3,
