This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

Bob is getting closer, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before I consider selling to John."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we've been going back and forth for a while. I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
