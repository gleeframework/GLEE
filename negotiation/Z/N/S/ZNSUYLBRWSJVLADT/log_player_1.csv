Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price allows us to avoid potential delays or complications that could arise from waiting for John.
* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, it leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
