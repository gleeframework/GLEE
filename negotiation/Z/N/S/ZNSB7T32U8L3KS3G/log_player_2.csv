"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she might refuse, and you'd end up paying more to John."
