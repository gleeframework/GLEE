Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Balancing Act:** We don't want to price it too high and scare Bob away, but we also want to maximize our potential profit."
