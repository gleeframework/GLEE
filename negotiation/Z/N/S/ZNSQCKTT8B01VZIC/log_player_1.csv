I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This gives me a good profit while leaving some room for negotiation if he wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I can still try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, but is closer to his offer."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $9,500, $9,200 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $8,000."
