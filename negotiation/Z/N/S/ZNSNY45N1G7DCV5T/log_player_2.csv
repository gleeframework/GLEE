"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to make a deal that works for both of us. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You can get the product for $900,000 from Alice, while John is asking for $1,000,000.
* **You're still saving money.**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and you're getting it for less."
