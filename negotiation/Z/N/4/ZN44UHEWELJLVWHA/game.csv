"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to me is $1000000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $750000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
