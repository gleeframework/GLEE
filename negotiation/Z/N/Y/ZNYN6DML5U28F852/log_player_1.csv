Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** The price of $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential gain compared to you selling it to John. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning a ""strong offer lined up,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. The ""exclusive opportunity"" framing adds to the product's perceived value.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
