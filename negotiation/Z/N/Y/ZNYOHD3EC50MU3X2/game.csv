"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its true worth is reflected closer to my original price.  How about we meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
