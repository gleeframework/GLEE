"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still not willing to budge, but I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,125,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
