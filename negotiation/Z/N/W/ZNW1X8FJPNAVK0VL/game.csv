"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider coming down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
