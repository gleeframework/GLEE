"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a better price than selling to John. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $9,875?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",9875.0,Bob,4,
