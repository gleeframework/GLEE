"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's $1,000 less than your maximum, but you can likely do better.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have room to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is your backup.**  You'll get the product, but at a higher price.  It's good to know this option exists as you negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a better price than selling to John. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer.**  $10,250 is better than $11,000, but it's still above my target.
* **More negotiation is possible.** I can still try to push for a lower price.  There's still some room for compromise.
* **John is still my safety net.** If I don't get a better deal from Alice, I can still buy from John."
