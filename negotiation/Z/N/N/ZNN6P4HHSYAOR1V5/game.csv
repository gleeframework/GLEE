"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,025,000. This acknowledges the value it brings while still representing a significant investment for you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but we need to bridge a more significant gap to reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider $980,000 as my final offer.
