"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given the potential benefits, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob's business helps justify the high price and positions it as an investment rather than just an expense.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language emphasizes that this is a ""starting point"" and I'm open to discussing the price further. This invites Bob to counter and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, I believe Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 leaves room for a significantly better deal. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to counter to try and secure a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,025,000. This acknowledges the value it brings while still representing a significant investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I've come down in price to show willingness to negotiate but remain above $1,000,000 to aim for a strong profit.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""unique benefits"" reinforces the product's value and why the price is justified.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  Framing it as finding a ""middle ground"" encourages Bob to move closer to my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  However, the pace is slow. I'll reject this offer to signal that his current offers are not meeting my expectations. I'll use the next counteroffer to make a more significant jump and test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but we need to bridge a more significant gap to reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider $980,000 as my final offer. This represents a substantial discount from my initial proposal and reflects my strong desire to see this product benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Stance:** I'm shifting to a firmer stance by presenting this as my ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to take this opportunity seriously.
* **Significant Jump:** By moving to $980,000, I'm making a larger concession to signal flexibility while staying above $975,000, which is a strong profit margin.
* **Limited Time:**  While not explicitly stated, implying limited time by expressing a strong desire to close the deal adds a subtle pressure to encourage a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $960,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I believe it's a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my $975,000 target. While I could push for more,  the difference is relatively small at this point. Accepting the $960,000 offer secures a very strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further drawn-out negotiations."
