Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent profit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  It's better to secure the $8,000 price from John than risk Alice sticking firm to a price higher than your budget."
