Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and this is a chance to acquire it before anyone else. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we want to maximize profit, starting too high (close to $1,500,000) might scare Bob off. Offering $1,300,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning exclusivity and the possibility of others being interested, we nudge Bob towards a quicker decision.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000, so we have a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer."
