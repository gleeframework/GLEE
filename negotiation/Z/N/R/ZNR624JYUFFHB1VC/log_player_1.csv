Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point for the negotiation.  I believe this price is justifiable given the value of the product to me, and it gives Bob room to negotiate. 

I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I believe I can negotiate a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This leaves some room for further bargaining while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want. At this point, I'm concerned that further negotiation might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a secure sale, and while it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the potential for a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
