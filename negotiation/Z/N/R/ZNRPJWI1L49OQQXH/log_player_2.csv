"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but there's room for negotiation. It's best to reject and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that 1050000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at 1250000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn.  While she's coming down slightly, $1,250,000 is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better price. You can still get a better deal from Alice, and you don't want to resort to buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  Let's aim for a deal that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 1100000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession to get a deal done. However, I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. How about we meet at 1300000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for too much, and you're getting closer to your limit with John's offer. It's worth pushing for a lower price, but if Alice won't budge much more, buying from John might be the better option. However, you still have a few rounds left to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This would allow us to both reach a fair compromise and close this deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to get a deal done. However, I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about we aim for 1275000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $1,275,000 is still too high. You have a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. You're already at the point where you're willing to consider John's offer, but you still have a chance to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would allow us to both reach a fair compromise and close this deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. Let's try to meet at 1250000 one last time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to your desired price but is still asking for $1,250,000.  This is only $250,000 below John's price, and you have only one round left. It is unlikely that Alice will drop her price further in the final round.  Given the time constraint and the risk of losing the product entirely, it's better to buy from John now to avoid any further delay."
