Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a clear understanding of my desired profit margin while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and proceed from there, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd hoped, but it's not significantly different from his previous offer.  Further negotiation might not yield a better result, and there's always the risk of him walking away.  Given the option to sell to John for $1,000,000,  accepting Bob's offer at $1,050,000 is the most secure option."
