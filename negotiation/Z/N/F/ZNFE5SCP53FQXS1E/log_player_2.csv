(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's much more beneficial to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $8,000.  This sets the baseline and shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but have a firm limit. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still way above my budget. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise. $9,500 is still significantly lower than her offer, and closer to my target price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping my budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget.  While it's closer to my target price, I'm going to continue negotiating.  The product is likely worth more to her than to me, so I'm hoping to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product. $10,500 is a significant increase from my previous offer but still below her offer.  This signals that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm also trying to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm determined to try and get a better price. I'm going to continue negotiating in hopes that she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying significantly below Alice's current offer. It's a risky move, as we're running out of rounds, but I'm hoping this aggressive approach will convince Alice to accept a price closer to my target.  This is a last-ditch effort before potentially having to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget.  While I've managed to negotiate down the price a bit, it's unlikely that she will come down to a price I'm comfortable with in this last round.  To avoid potentially losing out entirely, I'm choosing to purchase the product from John for $8,000.  It's not the ideal price, but it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
