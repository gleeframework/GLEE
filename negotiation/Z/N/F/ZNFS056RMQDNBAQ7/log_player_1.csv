Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) allows room for Bob to negotiate down a little, potentially still landing you a better price than John's offer.
* **Confident Approach:** The message positions the price as reflective of the product's value, not an arbitrary number. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes I don't know Bob's exact valuation of $10,000. If I had that information, I would offer it to him at $9,999 to maximize my profit."
