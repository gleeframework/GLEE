"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  Let's find a middle ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $1,175,000 is still too low.  I'm offering $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,250,000.  At this point, John's offer of $1,200,000 is the best deal and saves you time and potential negotiation hassle."
