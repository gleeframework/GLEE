"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
