Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'll need to see how Bob responds before deciding whether to stick to this price, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I need to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this product is worth more than $15,000.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd like, but it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John, and I can always use the extra money to invest in other opportunities."
