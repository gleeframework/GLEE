Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob's interested in this price.  If not, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I won't go lower than my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is way too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that. I'll counter offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's a price Bob will be willing to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum price. This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to settle for the same price with John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
