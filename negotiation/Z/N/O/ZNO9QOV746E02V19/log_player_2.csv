"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. There's a good chance she'll be willing to lower the price to get a deal, especially since she values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than 1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of 1350000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $1,200,000.  You have 7 rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still stuck at $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below 1350000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above your budget of $1,200,000. While you are close to your limit, it's still worth negotiating further. You have 5 rounds left and there is a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to secure a deal. Remember, John is a safe option if negotiations fall through, but you're still trying to save as much money as possible."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your commitment to finding a compromise, I'm still unable to go above my initial offer of $1,300,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for 1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of 1315000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,315,000 is still higher than your budget of $1,200,000.  With only three rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. It's more prudent to secure the product from John for your target price."
