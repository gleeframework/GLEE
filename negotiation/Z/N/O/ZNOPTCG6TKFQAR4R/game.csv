,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider a price of $900,000. This reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a profitable partnership.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to make a profit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
