"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  This product offers a lot of value, and I need to get closer to $18,000 for it.  How about we meet in the middle?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $9,250 for the product.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for working with me.  $9,250 is closer, but I still need to be above $15,000 for this.  How about we land at $16,500 and call it a deal?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $16,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'll offer $13,000 for the product.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're making me work for it!  I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be honest with you, I have another buyer who's offering $15,000.  I'd much rather make a deal with you, but I need to get at least that much.  How about $14,500 and we shake on it?",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not comfortable with $14,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'll offer $13,750 for the product.",13750.0,Bob,8,
