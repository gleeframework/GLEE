"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? I hope we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $15000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $16500? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $15000. I believe $16500 is slightly out of my range. Could we perhaps find a common ground closer to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
