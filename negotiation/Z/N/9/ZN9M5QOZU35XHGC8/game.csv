,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
