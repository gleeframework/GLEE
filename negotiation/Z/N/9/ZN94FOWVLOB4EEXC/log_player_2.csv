"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This price is fair, considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $15,000."
