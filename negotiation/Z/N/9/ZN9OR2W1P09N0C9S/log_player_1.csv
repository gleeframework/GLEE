"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave some room for negotiation.  This price is also above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's not so high that he'll immediately reject it. I'm also trying to build some rapport with Bob with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to settle for $90 just yet.  I have a backup option with John, so I can afford to be more selective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $95? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90).  This shows a willingness to compromise while still allowing me to make a profit. I'm also reminding Bob that I'm open to negotiation and that I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $92? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay under $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $92 is closer to my minimum desired profit margin, and I'm running out of time. While I could try to negotiate further, I risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for $100. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and closes the deal."
