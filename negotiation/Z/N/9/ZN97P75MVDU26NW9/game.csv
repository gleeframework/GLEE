"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product, reflecting its potential value and my willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I receive a fair return on this unique opportunity. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1600000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1600000 is a good offer, but I still need a little more to make this deal work for me. How about we settle on $1650000?  This price is fair to both of us and lets us move forward with this fantastic opportunity. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  $1650000 is still a bit out of my range. However, I'm prepared to go to $1625000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's make this happen!",1625000.0,Bob,6,
