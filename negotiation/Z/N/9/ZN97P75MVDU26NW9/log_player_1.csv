Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product, reflecting its potential value and my willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can find common ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to Test the Waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer will allow me to gauge his seriousness and potentially push him to offer a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial asking price. This strategy aims to show flexibility while maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1600000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price of $1,750,000.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and see if he's willing to increase his offer further. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my previous offer. This will demonstrate flexibility while also encouraging Bob to meet me halfway."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1600000 is a good offer, but I still need a little more to make this deal work for me. How about we settle on $1,650,000?  This price is fair to both of us and lets us move forward with this fantastic opportunity. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm still not accepting his previous offer, indicating that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone and encourages a quick resolution, showing confidence in the deal's potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  $1650000 is still a bit out of my range. However, I'm prepared to go to $1625000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my previous counteroffer. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a price close to my desired range without risking further negotiation. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's important to avoid the risk of Bob walking away or making counteroffers that are less favorable. 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,650,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. It's a calculated risk to close the deal now rather than potentially losing the opportunity to sell to Bob altogether."
