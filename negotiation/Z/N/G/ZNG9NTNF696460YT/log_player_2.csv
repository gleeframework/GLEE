"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $14,000 is still higher than your target price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm hoping to get it closer to $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $13,000. This still represents a significant saving for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within your budget and a good deal for you. There's still some room for negotiation, but it's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to haggle, especially since you have a backup option with John."
