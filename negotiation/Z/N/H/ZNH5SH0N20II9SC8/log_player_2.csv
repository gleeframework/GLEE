# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great price, as the product is worth at least $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $11,500. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
