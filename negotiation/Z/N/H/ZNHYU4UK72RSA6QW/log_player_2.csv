"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. A $1,500 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant step towards Bob's goal, and is likely to be a reasonable starting point for negotiations. This offer is still higher than Alice's value for the product, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $15,000. While the deal with John is a backup, Bob should exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to reach a compromise.  This counteroffer is a $500 increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still trying to keep the price down. This offer also leaves room for a possible counter-offer from Alice that could lead to a deal."
