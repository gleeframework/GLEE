"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still interested in the product and willing to negotiate further.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident this product offers significant return on investment, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $2,000,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price point doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. I believe this is a highly competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,900,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to make a significant purchase.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible throughout these negotiations because I believe in finding a fair agreement. However, I need to be upfront â€“  $1,700,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept. My final offer is $1,800,000. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1800000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that $1,800,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to make a significant purchase. I'm willing to walk away if this doesn't work, but I'd rather not have to go to John for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
