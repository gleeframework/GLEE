"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $11,000.  I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John. You can save a substantial amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
