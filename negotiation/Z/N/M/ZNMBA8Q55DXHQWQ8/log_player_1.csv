Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

This approach balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
