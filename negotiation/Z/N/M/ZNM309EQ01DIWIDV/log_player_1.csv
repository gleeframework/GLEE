Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested. 
* **Stay Above Your Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
