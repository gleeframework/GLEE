"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than what Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of desire.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The open-ended question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my minimum value ($15,000) in the initial rounds. If he's not, I'll gradually lower the price, but always keeping in mind that I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has expressed interest in the product.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll also try to understand why he's so resistant to paying more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This takes into account your interest and allows for some wiggle room for us both.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of his interest in the product and suggesting that my offer is a good value for him.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Again, I'm inviting Bob to continue the dialogue and potentially accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's initial offer. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price, but I'm also prepared to lower my price further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Compromise:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than his initial $9,000 offer. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet at $10,750?  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your offer, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price again, showing a continued willingness to negotiate.  
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I've proposed a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's current offer ($10,500). This can help feel like a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,750. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to move above $10,500, and this price is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my desired outcome.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a better price, I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him when there's a guaranteed sale to John that meets my minimum price."
