Round 2

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current proposal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I respect your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Considering the market value and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal before accepting an offer below my valuation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my needs. Based on my analysis and budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is now exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (what John is offering). It's a strong offer, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or me losing him as a buyer altogether."
