Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is firmly above that mark.  I could consider coming down to $925,000.  This feels like a fairer reflection of what it brings to the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $925,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go to $750,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and is moving towards our acceptable price point. Holding firm and countering again keeps the negotiation moving and potentially allows us to secure a better deal than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $862,500. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's true value."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $862,500 is closer, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our absolute minimum acceptable price. While we could push for more in the remaining rounds, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting now secures the sale at a price equal to our alternative option (John)."
