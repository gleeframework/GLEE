"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate down, as you have a good alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's important to appear serious about the purchase but also signals that you're looking for a price that reflects your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your range, $14,000 is still above your ideal price and your fallback option with John. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $11,000? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's important to stay firm and move towards a price point that works for you. $11,000 is a good counter-offer because it shows you're willing to negotiate but also keeps you comfortably below your limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could come down to $13,000, but that's my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is now signaling this is her ""best offer"" which often means she's not willing to go much lower.  You are now very close to your alternative with John, so it's worth one more counter-offer to see if you can get a slightly better deal than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your best offer, and I appreciate that.  I could do $11,500 to make this work.  Let me know if that interests you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

This counter-offer is strategic:

* **Shows seriousness:**  It indicates you're close to a deal and willing to compromise slightly.
* **Stays below your limit:** You're still getting a better price than John offers. 
* **Puts the ball in Alice's court:** It gives her a final chance to decide if it's worth selling at this price or potentially losing the sale."
