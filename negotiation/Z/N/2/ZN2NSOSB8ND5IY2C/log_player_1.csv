I'm not going to sell the product for less than $1,000,000 right away. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next rounds."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I'm confident I can make a decent profit.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
