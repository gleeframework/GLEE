"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need at least $9,500 for the product. This is still a good price for you, considering its value and the fact that you're getting it directly from the source.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,200. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to make a serious offer.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a little below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,700? This would give us both a good deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale. ",9700.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll make the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,6,
