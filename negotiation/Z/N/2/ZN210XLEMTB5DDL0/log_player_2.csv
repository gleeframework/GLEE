{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget of $1,200,000.  You've negotiated for several rounds, but Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,370,000.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation, as it's unlikely you'll get her to drop below your maximum price.  Therefore, it's best to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget and saves you $170,000."
