,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $7,800 is still a bit too low.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $8,200.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
