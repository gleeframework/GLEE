"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. You're looking to spend no more than $800,000, and she's asking for $1,000,000.
* There's no point in buying from John immediately because you might be able to get a better deal with Alice through negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've indicated. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've indicated. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to your target, you're still looking to spend less than $800,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price.
* Buying from John immediately would mean missing out on the chance to potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $925,000 is still a bit too much.  Let's meet in the middle at $887,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $887,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $906,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $906,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $906,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $906,250 is still above your target of $800,000.
* You have 5 rounds left, but given the negotiation pattern, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $887,500, which is still too high for you.
* You're running out of time and the risk of not finding a deal with Alice is increasing.
* Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees you the product within your budget and saves you time and potential frustration."
