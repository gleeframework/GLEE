"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've indicated. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've indicated.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $925,000 is still a bit too much.  Let's meet in the middle at $887,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $887,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $906,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",906250.0,Alice,5,
