Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've indicated. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. I have 9 rounds left and am willing to risk losing this sale to potentially secure a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've indicated."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $925,000 is still a bit too much.  Let's meet in the middle at $887,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $900,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $887,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $906,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 906250}
