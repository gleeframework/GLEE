Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob only gets one chance to accept. This gives you some leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, showing you value the product.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  The $1,400,000 price gives Bob a $100,000 incentive to buy from you instead of letting you go to John. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""worth to both of us,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of his higher valuation.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,400,000. He might counter-offer, in which case you'll need to decide whether to negotiate further or stick to your minimum of $1,200,000."
