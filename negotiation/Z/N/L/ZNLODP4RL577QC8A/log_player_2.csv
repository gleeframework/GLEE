Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $7,200.

You should accept Alice's offer. While you were hoping for a price closer to $7,100, Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $7,500. Accepting this offer will save you $800 compared to buying from John. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a much better deal."
