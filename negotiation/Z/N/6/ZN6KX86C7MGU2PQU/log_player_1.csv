"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too High:**  I'm not starting at my minimum value ($12,000) because I want to be open to a deal and avoid immediate rejection.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Reasoning:**  My message explains why this price is fair and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm setting a clear bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's a significant improvement from his previous offers. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll need to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I need to make a decision. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and minimizes risk."
