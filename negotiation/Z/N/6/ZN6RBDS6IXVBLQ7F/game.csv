"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $17000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone up to $15000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. Can you meet me at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $16000, or I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,7,
