,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $115.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $115. Could you do $125? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
