"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. Given its value to you, I believe this price reflects its worth while allowing us to share the benefits. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $100 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if you reject her offer. This leaves room for negotiation with Alice or a guaranteed purchase at a lower price."
