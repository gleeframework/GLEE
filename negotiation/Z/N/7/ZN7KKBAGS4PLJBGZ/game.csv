"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This would still leave you a good profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
