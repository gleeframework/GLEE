"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of securing a good price while also not immediately pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. I believe this shows good faith and increases the chances of a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is still a significant profit, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push the price closer to my desired range.  I'm also aware that John is a potential buyer, and I don't want to risk losing the negotiation completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm dropping my counteroffer slightly to $13,000. This is another compromise, showing flexibility while still holding out for a price above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to make a final move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. With 4 rounds left, I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price before potentially settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm dropping my counteroffer again to $12,500. This is getting very close to Bob's offer and I'm hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. With only two rounds left, Bob is not showing much willingness to meet my price, and I'm running out of time to negotiate. John's offer is my safety net, and while it's not ideal, it guarantees a profit and prevents me from risking losing the deal altogether."
