You should accept Alice's offer.  You've reached a price that's only slightly above your budget of $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than buying from John and you've successfully negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer.  You only have one round left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better price."
