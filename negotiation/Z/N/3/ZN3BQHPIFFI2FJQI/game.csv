"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is low, but $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $75? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and seems like a good compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $75 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
