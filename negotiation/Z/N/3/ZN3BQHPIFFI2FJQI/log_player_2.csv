"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $85. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation to save a mere $5, especially when I have a guaranteed offer for $80 from John."
