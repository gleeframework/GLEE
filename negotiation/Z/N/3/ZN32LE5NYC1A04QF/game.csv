"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me, and still leaves you with a profit margin.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a good deal for everyone involved.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit and close the deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to finalize the deal soon.",9750.0,Bob,6,
