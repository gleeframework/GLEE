"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me, and still leaves you with a profit margin."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below my minimum, but still high enough to be profitable. This will hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate rather than outright reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being reasonable to Bob. This counteroffer reflects my willingness to negotiate and should encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a good deal for everyone involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm hoping to get a bit more, so I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit and close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to finalize the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum price, but Bob is not budging much.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating with him. The longer we go, the more likely he'll walk away. Selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible option at this point."
