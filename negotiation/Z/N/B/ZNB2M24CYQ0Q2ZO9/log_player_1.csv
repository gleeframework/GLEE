Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Knowing it's worth a significant amount to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This represents a fair opportunity for us both to benefit from this transaction."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** I'm not simply throwing out a number. The message emphasizes the value to Bob and positions the price as mutually beneficial.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he's very interested but finds the price a bit steep. 

**Strategy:** This approach aims to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob might accept it outright. If Bob rejects it, I haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
