"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its true market value. I'm confident you'll find this offer appealing. However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
