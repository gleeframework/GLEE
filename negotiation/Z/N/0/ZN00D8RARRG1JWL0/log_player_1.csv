Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current financial situation, I can't commit to a price higher than $1,300,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $1,300,000 and is unlikely to budge. Accepting this offer would mean a $200,000 loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's strategically wiser to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
