"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be open to meeting me halfway at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we settle at $790,000?  That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",790000.0,Bob,6,
