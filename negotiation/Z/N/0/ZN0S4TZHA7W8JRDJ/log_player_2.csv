{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy to potentially get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price slightly below Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* This price is still above Alice's value for the product, making it potentially appealing to her.
* It leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects this counteroffer."

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than my desired price point.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now very close to my desired price point.

* Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price, saving me time and potentially avoiding a worse outcome in the remaining rounds."
