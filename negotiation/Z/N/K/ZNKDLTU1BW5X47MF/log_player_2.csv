Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is significantly below the value of the product for both of us.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $775,000. This still allows you a good deal and ensures I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?

That's a slight increase from your last offer and closer to the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.
