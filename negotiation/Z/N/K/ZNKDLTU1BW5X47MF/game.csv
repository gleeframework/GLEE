"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is significantly below the value of the product for both of us.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $775,000. This still allows you a good deal and ensures I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $737,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to get a fair price for this product.  While I understand your offer, $737,500 is still below what I can accept. Let's try $762,500. That's a slight increase from your last offer and closer to the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.",762500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000?  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
