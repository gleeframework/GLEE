"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
