"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
