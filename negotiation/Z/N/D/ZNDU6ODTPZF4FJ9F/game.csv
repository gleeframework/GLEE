"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more competitive price. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm looking to make this purchase closer to the $900,000 mark.  Would you be willing to consider a price in that range?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
