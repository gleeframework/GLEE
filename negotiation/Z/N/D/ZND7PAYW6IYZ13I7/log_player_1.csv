Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's also lower than what I could get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also ensures that I don't lose out on a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum target with Bob's latest offer, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is much more than what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm choosing to sell to John to maximize my profits and avoid any further potential loss."
