"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also takes into account your budget.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'll find a good use for it.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer it to you for $11,250. I think that's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",11250.0,Alice,5,
