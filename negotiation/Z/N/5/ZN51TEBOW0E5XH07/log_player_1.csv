{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. 
    * You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its perceived value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly without scaring him off with an excessively high price."
