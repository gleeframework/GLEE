Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit higher than $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is fair considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's very close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This price is fair considering the product's value and allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,175,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's getting late in the game. To ensure I don't lose out entirely, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
