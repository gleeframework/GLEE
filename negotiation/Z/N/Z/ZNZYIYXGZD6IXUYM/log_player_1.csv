"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant increase from John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and what I initially offered ($1,200,000). There's still room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This price is still fair and gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm excited about the potential return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point. While $950,000 is still below my initial goal, it's a significant increase from his previous offer and represents a good compromise. Accepting this offer will net me a higher profit than selling to John, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward with a potential buyer who values the product."
