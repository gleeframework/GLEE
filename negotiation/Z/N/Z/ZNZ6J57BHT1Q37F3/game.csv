"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $13000. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $13000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11000 doesn't quite cover what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12000 is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $11500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $12250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11750 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",11750.0,Bob,6,
