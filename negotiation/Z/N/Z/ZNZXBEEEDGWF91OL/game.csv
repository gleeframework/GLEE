"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price of $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider that?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $8,950? That's a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8950.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $8,950 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000",8800.0,Bob,6,
