"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's potential, and it gives us both a chance to close the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However,  $900,000 is still not enough.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while keeping the deal within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and we're getting closer to a deal. I'm hoping you'll reconsider and accept this offer. ",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing hard, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, I need to be realistic about my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a substantial drop from my previous offer, and a final chance for us to close this deal.  It's up to you now.",975000.0,Alice,7,
