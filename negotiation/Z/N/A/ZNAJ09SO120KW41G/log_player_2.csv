**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. You know it's worth no more than $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy it for that price from John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This may lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer.
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything by rejecting. You can always fall back on buying from John for $1,000,000."
