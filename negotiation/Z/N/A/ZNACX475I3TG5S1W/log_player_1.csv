Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a little more than $750,000. It's not a huge difference from John's offer, but if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob, I will."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

``` 

Bob's offer is a good one, and I don't want to risk losing him by trying to push for more. $850,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy with that."
