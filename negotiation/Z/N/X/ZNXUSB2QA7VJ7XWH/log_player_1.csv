""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Negotiation Space:**  This creates a potential profit range of $700,000 ($1,500,000 - $800,000). 

By offering the product at $1,300,000:

* **High Profit:** You secure a $500,000 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a buffer for potential negotiation while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's valuation, making it more likely he'll find it acceptable."
