"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $750,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's less than his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than what he would pay to John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice backing out or him having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for saving a bit more."
