"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about $1,050,000 for the product? This would still allow me to make a profit while offering you a price that is more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I understand your position, I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $1,060,000 be acceptable for you? This would allow me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
