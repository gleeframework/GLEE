"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's true value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate the fact that you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10500. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'll propose $9000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go to $9000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10250. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10250.0,Alice,7,
