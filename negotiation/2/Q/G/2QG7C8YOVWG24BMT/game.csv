"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000.  It's a steal considering its value to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $15000 was a bit high. However, $8000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $11500.  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to go down to $10500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
