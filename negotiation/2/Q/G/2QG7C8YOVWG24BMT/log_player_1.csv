Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to go down to $10,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
