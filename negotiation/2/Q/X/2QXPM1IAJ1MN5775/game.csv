"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $950,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $950,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $850,000 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $900,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
