Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below his perceived value leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** If I go too low, Bob might think there's something wrong with the product or my assessment of it.  
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
