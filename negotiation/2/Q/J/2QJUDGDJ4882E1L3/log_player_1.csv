{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $800,000 with John, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of getting $100,000 more is worth taking. 
* **Uncertainty:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm starting high. 
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price slightly to see if it's more appealing."
