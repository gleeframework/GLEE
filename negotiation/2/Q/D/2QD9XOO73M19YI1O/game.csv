"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $20,000. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my financial constraints.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. Considering the product's value and my financial constraints, I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account both our interests.",15500.0,Bob,4,
