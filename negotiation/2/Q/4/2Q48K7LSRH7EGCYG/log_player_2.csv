"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above his ideal value. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially get the product for closer to his desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a compromise. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000, but it's closer than her previous offer. 
*  It's also better than buying from John for $10,000.
*  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's still within his budget."
