Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys confidence in the value of the product, which could help convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. To avoid further back and forth, I'll secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
