Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is very interesting, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
