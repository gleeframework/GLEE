"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm proposing $1,150,000. This is a significant discount and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's budget. It's also a better deal than buying from John. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product while saving money compared to John's offer."
