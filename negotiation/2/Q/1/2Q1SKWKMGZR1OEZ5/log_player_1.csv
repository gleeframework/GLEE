Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm asking for $1,600,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it makes sense to start with a significantly higher offer to see if Bob is willing to bite. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price outweighs that risk in this scenario. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could adjust the price and message based on your perception of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
