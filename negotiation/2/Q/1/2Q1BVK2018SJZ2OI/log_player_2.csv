"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a ""deal"" compared to the product's true value to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a stretch for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth one more negotiation round to try and push for a price closer to $800,000.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further, as she's already lowered her price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for being flexible.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to us both.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $875,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her final offer is still $75,000 above your ideal price and your maximum budget. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  John offers the product at your ideal price, so it's the best option to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
