"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a stretch for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for being flexible.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to us both.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $875,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's worth considering.
