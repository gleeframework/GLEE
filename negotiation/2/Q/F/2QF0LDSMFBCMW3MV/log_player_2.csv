"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price significantly lower than its true value. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a substantial discount. Consider the potential return on your investment, and let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
