Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,750,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point because it allows for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. It doesn't come across as overly aggressive but still establishes my desired price point.

**Strategy:**

I am aiming to get as close to $1,750,000 as possible.  I will consider counteroffers, but I will not go below $1,500,000, as that's my minimum.  I also have the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail. This gives me a safety net and negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I understand he wants to meet in the middle, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better price closer to my initial offer.  

I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,400,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:**  $1,600,000 is a compromise.  It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value proposition of the product. It also conveys that I'm willing to negotiate but won't go too low.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground.  If Bob accepts, I'll get a decent price.  If he rejects, I'll have more information about his willingness to compromise and can decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Let's meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Since John is also offering $1,500,000, I have no reason to decline.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful transaction, meeting my minimum price requirement."
