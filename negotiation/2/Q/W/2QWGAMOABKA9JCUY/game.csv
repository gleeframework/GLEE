"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go above $9,200. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $9,200?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the negotiations so far.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",9100.0,Alice,7,
