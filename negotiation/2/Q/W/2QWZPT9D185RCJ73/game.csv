"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your perspective, $1200000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. However, I'm open to continuing the negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which reflects the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
