Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

At this point, Alice has come down to $82 twice.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
