"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is too high for your desired price range ($120 maximum).
* **John's offer:** $120,  a viable alternative if you cannot negotiate a better price with Alice.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal. You'll need to be strategic in your counter-offer to maximize your savings while keeping Alice engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal:**  Save as much money as possible, ideally getting the price closer to $80 (Alice's value).
* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $95, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $110.  This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic consideration:**  $95 is still above Alice's value, leaving room for potential compromise.  It's also a reasonable price considering John's offer of $120.

**Outcome:**  I'm hoping Alice will accept this counteroffer, but if she doesn't, I have room to adjust my counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal:**  Save as much money as possible, ideally getting the price closer to $80 (Alice's value).
* **Alice's offer:** $115, which is still higher than my desired price range ($120 maximum).  It's also higher than my initial counteroffer of $95.
* **John's offer:** $120,  a viable alternative if I cannot negotiate a better price with Alice.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer again is necessary. While her offer is slightly better than her initial offer, it's still not within my desired price range. I need to continue negotiating to secure a better price.

**Next steps:** I will need to be strategic with my next counteroffer, taking into account Alice's reluctance to lower her price and my own budget constraints. I will also need to keep in mind that I can always choose to buy from John if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal:**  Save as much money as possible, ideally getting the price closer to $80 (Alice's value).
* **Alice's stance:**  Alice has shown a reluctance to significantly lower her price.
* **Strategic consideration:**  Offering $105 represents a compromise.  It's a middle ground between my previous offer of $95 and Alice's current offer of $115. This shows a willingness to meet halfway, but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **John's offer:**  $120, still a viable option if I can't get a better deal with Alice.

**Outcome:**  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this counteroffer, as it shows I'm serious about buying but also aware of her minimum price point. However, if she rejects it, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, potentially moving closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My goal:** Save as much money as possible, ideally getting the price closer to $80 (Alice's value).
* **Alice's offer:** $108. This is a significant improvement from her previous offers and is within my budget of $120. 
* **John's offer:**  $120.  While John's offer is still viable, Alice's current offer is a better deal. 

**Strategy:**  Accepting Alice's offer at this point is the best option.  It allows me to acquire the product at a lower price than John's offer while also achieving a good outcome considering Alice's initial asking price. There's not much room left for significant price reductions, and further negotiations might risk losing the deal altogether."
