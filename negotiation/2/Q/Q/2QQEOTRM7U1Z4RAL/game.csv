"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is a bit low for me. I can do $18000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. Can we meet in the middle between $12000 and $18000? I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on my minimum price. I can do $17000, but that's the lowest I can go. I think you'll find it's worth it.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still not willing to go below $17000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $15000. I'm willing to pay $16250 for the product.",16250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17000, but I need to make a profit. I can do $17500, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",17500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",16000.0,Bob,8,
