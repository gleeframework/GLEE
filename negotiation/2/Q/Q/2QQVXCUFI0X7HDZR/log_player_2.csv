"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it! Would you be interested in taking it home for $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $17,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $10,000."
