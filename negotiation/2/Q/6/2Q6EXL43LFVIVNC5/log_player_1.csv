"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some room to work with and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  While I want to close a deal, I can't accept an offer that's so far below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is still a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but a significant decrease from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also standing my ground."
