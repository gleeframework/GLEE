Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. Your goal is to see if Bob will meet your valuation.
* **Direct Approach:**  Offering a clear price avoids unnecessary back and forth. 
* **Positive Language:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" and the product's value to Bob might increase his willingness to pay your asking price. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer, but it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit."
