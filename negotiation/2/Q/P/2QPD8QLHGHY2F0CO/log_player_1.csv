Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming for a higher price since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in it and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than I initially hoped, it's a decent price and it's getting closer to what I want.  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is only offering $1,000,000."
