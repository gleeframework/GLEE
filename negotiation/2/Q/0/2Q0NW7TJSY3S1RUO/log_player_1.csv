{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. This price point is attractive to Bob (as it's below his valuation) and profitable for you (well above your minimum). 

**Why not higher?**  While you could start higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob and forcing him to negotiate down. This direct approach aims for a quick, mutually beneficial agreement."
