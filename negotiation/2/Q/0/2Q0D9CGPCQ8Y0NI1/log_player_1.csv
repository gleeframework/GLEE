Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's less likely he'll go as low as your minimum if he's genuinely interested. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it or counters with a significantly lower offer, you'll know you need to adjust your approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and end the negotiation now, there's a chance you might be able to get a slightly higher price.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if Bob is willing to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** By suggesting you're meeting halfway, you show a willingness to negotiate, which can be encouraging to Bob.
* **Maintaining a Higher Price Point:** $15,000 is a significant amount above Bob's initial offer and still provides you with a good profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counter-offer leaves some space for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial situation, I can only commit to a maximum of $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his maximum price twice.  It's unlikely he's going to budge further. Holding onto the product hoping for a better offer from Bob risks losing the guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's time to accept Bob's offer."
