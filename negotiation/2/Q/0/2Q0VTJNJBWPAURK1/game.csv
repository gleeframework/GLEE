"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close this deal quickly. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,5,
