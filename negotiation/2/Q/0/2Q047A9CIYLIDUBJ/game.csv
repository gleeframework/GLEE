"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting its unique value.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  I'm really close to my limit on this, though.  I'm only able to go up to $10,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize this.  Otherwise, I'll need to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
