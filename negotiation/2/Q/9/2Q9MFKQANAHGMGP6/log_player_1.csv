Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. I'm also framing it in a way that highlights the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, though. How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really think that's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $120,  I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer of $80.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price for the product."
