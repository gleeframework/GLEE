"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures a good profit if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $85 is too low for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $90 even? That's a good compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a good compromise and represents a solid profit for me. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially as John is offering a significantly lower price."
