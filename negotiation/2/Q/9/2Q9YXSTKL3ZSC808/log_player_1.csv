Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This is because I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his price range and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still significantly higher than my minimum, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope that Bob will be willing to accept it."
