Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** Framing the offer as ""fair"" can help encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to a deal with Bob.  I'm starting high to see if I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counter-offer, and if necessary, move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price.  This gives me leverage to try and push Bob closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer now allows me to make a counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but not drastically lowering my price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the concession I'm making to encourage him to accept.
* **Collaborative Tone:** The message emphasizes finding a ""solution that works for both of us,""  encouraging a win-win scenario.

**Reasoning:**

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Flexibility:**  If he accepts, I've successfully increased the price.
* **Leave Room for Further Negotiation:**  If he rejects, I can still adjust my price based on his next counter-offer.
* **Maintain a Collaborative Approach:**  Staying open to negotiation increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,080,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I reach my minimum profit goal.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing negotiations with Bob could take time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Risk Aversion:** It's generally a good strategy to secure a guaranteed deal when a satisfactory offer is available."
