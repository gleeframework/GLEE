"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value; however, I need to be closer to $975,000 for this to make sense for me.  I believe that price reflects the true potential of this product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the price is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $725,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $725,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $890,000. This is my final offer.  I think it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",890000.0,Alice,5,
