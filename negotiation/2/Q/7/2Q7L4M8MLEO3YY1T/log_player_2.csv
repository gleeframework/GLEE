You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value; however, I need to be closer to $975,000 for this to make sense for me.  I believe that price reflects the true potential of this product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $725,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $890,000. This is my final offer.  I think it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  While she's come down in price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget. John offers a sure thing at $800,000, making it the best financial decision."
