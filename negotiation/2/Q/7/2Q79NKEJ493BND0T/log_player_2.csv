"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's not so low that it's immediately insulting.
* **Shows Interest:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product, making Alice more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message also suggests a willingness to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer is still $50,000 above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for Compromise:**  Even though John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, Bob can potentially get a better price from Alice. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge further.
* **Negotiating Power:**  By rejecting this offer, Bob maintains some negotiating power and shows Alice that he's serious about getting a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm getting a great product and it's close to what I can afford.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is only increasing his offer by $25,000, demonstrating a genuine effort to compromise. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal.
* **Justified Offer:**  Bob emphasizes the value of the product and his budget constraints, providing a justification for his offer. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** The message is worded to encourage a positive response from Alice.  

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping Bob within a reasonable range of his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While $1,025,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's try to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,040,000 is still $40,000 higher than Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Close to Agreement:**  This offer is very close to the price John is offering. However, Bob has already successfully negotiated a lower price, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the negotiation open and retains some leverage. He may be able to secure a better price in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting very close! I understand your need to get a good price, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's just a little over what I'm comfortable spending. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1030000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob increases his offer by only $10,000, showing a strong commitment to closing the deal while still keeping his budget in mind.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:**  The message emphasizes finding a compromise and finalizing the deal, showing Bob is ready to move forward.
* **Finality:** The message also hints that this may be Bob's final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the remaining gap and hopefully get Alice to accept the deal."
