"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm getting a great product and it's close to what I can afford.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While $1,025,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's try to make this happen.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting very close! I understand your need to get a good price, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's just a little over what I'm comfortable spending. Let's finalize this deal!",1030000.0,Bob,6,
