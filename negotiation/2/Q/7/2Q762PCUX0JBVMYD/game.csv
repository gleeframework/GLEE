"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I was really interested in the product, but I just can't justify paying more than $13000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. I'm also considering buying the product from John for $12000, so I'd like to know if you're willing to meet my price or not.",13000.0,Bob,6,
