"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to get the product for a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but it's still above my target price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Alice's price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's beneficial to me. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I can do $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is firm on her price, and $95 is a reasonable deal. It's better to save $5 than to risk ending up with no deal and having to buy from John for $100."
