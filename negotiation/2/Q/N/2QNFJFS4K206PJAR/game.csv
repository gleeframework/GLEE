"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $95?  It's still a good price for you, and a fair deal for me.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $95 is closer to my budget, I still aim to stay within $80. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $85 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to go a little lower.  Let's split the difference and make it $90.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
