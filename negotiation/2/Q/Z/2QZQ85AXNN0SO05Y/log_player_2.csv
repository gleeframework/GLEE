"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a lower price. Since I have an alternative option (buying from John), I'm not under pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I'm confident this price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a fair compromise.  I'm able to save $450,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small reduction, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
