"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000. I'm confident this price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
