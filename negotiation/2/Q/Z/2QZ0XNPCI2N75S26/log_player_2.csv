"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still rounds left, so he can continue to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $12,000 price point, but he needs to start with an offer that's realistic.  $12,500 is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still do better.  He has multiple rounds left, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option.  There's a good chance he can push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise, but it still stays below his maximum price point.  This approach keeps the negotiations moving and might push Alice to make a more favorable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his target price, but Alice's offer is still too high. He has multiple rounds left, so he should keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  The risk of going to John at this point is that he might be able to secure a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but Alice's offer is still too high. He is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This strategy might pressure Alice to accept his next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he's still not at his target.  He's only got 3 rounds left, but there's still time to see if he can get a better deal.  Rejection and counter-offering are the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his target price, but Alice's offer is still too high. He is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This strategy might pressure Alice to accept his next offer, as there are only 2 rounds left.  This offer also shows that Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical moment.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, he only has one round left. The risk is that Alice might not budge further, and he'll end up with a price higher than his desired $12,000.  

Since John is offering the product at Bob's maximum price point, it's the most logical choice to go with John. This guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price."
