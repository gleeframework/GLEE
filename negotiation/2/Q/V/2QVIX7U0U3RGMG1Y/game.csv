"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $9,500 is a bit steep for me at this time. Would it be possible to lower the price to $9,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
