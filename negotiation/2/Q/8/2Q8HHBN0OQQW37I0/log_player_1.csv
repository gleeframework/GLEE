"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message highlights the benefits for Bob, emphasizing that it's a ""great deal"" and a ""valuable asset"". This aims to make the offer more appealing.
* **Room to Move:**  While $1,000,000 is still above my minimum, it allows for potential concessions during the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and framing the offer positively, I'm setting the stage for a successful negotiation. I aim to leverage Bob's interest in the product and push him towards a price closer to my desired value. However, I'm prepared to potentially make concessions if necessary, as long as I can secure a price that is at least $1,200,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiating Room:** Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **Value of the Product:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I'm not willing to settle for less. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and can potentially push him closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still within a reasonable range that Bob might be willing to accept. I will also continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits for Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. Let's aim for a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price of $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reaffirming the value of the product, emphasizing its potential benefits for Bob's business. This helps keep the focus on the long-term value and not just the price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a price that benefits both of us, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway and emphasizing the value of the product, I'm aiming to find a compromise that allows me to secure a price closer to my minimum while also giving Bob a fair deal. This strategy balances the need for a profitable sale with the potential risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** While the offer is closer to my desired price, there's still a significant gap. If I accept, I'll be selling the product for much less than its worth to me. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially push Bob higher.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to risk losing the deal with Bob, as I believe I can still secure a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a middle ground that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget concerns.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the significant value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm again offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's significant value, reiterating the benefits he'll receive. This helps to justify my price point. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I'm emphasizing that the proposed price is ""fair"" and allows both of us to ""benefit"". This positive framing aims to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to continue the negotiation while slowly inching towards my desired price. It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but also that I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While the offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell the product for significantly less than its worth to me.
* **Limited Time:** With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my needs.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to risk losing the deal with Bob, as I believe I can still secure a better price. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  This product is truly unique and will give you a significant competitive edge.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $985,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 985000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is framed as my ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and potentially motivating Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  I'm only coming down slightly from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm still committed to getting a price closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the unique value and benefits of the product, reinforcing the justification for my price.

**Strategy:**

With time running out, I'm taking a more aggressive approach. I'm pushing closer to my desired price while still offering a compromise. This is a risky strategy, but it could pay off if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to our last two rounds. 
* **Limited Gain:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's only a small gap between his offer and my desired price, and I'm not sure if I can convince him to go higher in just one round.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a secure and predictable outcome.

**Strategy:**

With time running out and limited potential for a better offer from Bob, I'm choosing the safe option and selling to John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, the risk of not reaching an agreement in the final round outweighs the potential gain."
