Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer is only valid for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay the full $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's a substantial profit margin for Alice (almost 30% above her minimum) and offers Bob a significant saving compared to finding a similar product elsewhere.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a time limit, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
