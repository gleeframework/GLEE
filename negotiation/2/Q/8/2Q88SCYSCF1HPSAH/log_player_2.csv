"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $150. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and Alice is offering the product at $150, it makes sense to accept her offer.  There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John for the same price."
