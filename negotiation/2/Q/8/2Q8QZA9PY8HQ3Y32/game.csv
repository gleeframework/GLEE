"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10000. Would you be willing to accept that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $11000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
