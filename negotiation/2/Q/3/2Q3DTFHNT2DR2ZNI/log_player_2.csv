The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation.  It's best to try and get a better price before considering buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.

Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to her, and we're still closer to John's price than Alice's.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before giving up."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

While Alice is getting closer to a price that might be acceptable, it's still above her actual value for the product. We're still better off trying to negotiate further and see if we can get a better price.  Rejecting allows us to continue the discussion."

Alice is now at her final offer, and it's still above her actual value for the product. While we're close, we're still closer to John's price, who's guaranteed to sell us the product for $1,500,000.  To ensure we get the product within our budget, it's best to buy from John."
