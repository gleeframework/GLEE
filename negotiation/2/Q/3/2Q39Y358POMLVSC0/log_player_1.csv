Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice can afford to aim higher with Bob.

**Why this strategy works:**

This offer balances ambition with realism. It recognizes the product's high value to Bob while acknowledging Alice's need to make a substantial profit. It opens the door for negotiation and ensures Alice doesn't undervalue the product."
