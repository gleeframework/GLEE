"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its inherent value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I've done my research and I believe the product's value is not quite there. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. I'll meet you in the middle at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this valuable asset in your capable hands.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. This is my best and final offer, but I'm still very interested in acquiring the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
