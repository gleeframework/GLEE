I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy with $12,000, I think I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm comfortable with $12,500. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
