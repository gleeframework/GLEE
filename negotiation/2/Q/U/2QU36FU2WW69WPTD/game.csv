"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my maximum budget, and I think it's still a fair price considering the unique value you've described.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1400000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $1200000. It's a fair price for a unique product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
