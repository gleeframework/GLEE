"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I have a good starting point for a deal. I'm hoping this will make him think about the value and motivate him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $800,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm offering a price that is slightly more than my minimum, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price,  $775,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll counteroffer again, trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal.  It's a great price for a product you value highly."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering my absolute minimum price, making it clear that this is my final offer. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this price. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for the same price."
