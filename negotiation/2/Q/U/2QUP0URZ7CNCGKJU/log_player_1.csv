Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a final offer from my side, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
