"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true value, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's try to find a middle ground and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground. However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,050,000. This represents a significant investment for you, and I believe the product's potential will more than justify that price. Let's aim for a win-win and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $975,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This represents a significant investment for you, and I'm confident the product's potential will make it well worth the price. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",990000.0,Bob,8,
