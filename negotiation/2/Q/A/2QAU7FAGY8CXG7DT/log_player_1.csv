Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price."
