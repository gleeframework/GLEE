"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
