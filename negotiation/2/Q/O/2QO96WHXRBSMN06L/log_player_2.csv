"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is much lower.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still showing I'm serious.
* **Focus on value:** I'm referencing the product's value to me, highlighting that I'm willing to pay, but within a reasonable range.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends on a positive note, suggesting a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $22,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is too low for a product of this quality. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before considering buying from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but that's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm showing Alice that I'm actively trying to find a middle ground, not just rejecting her offers outright.
* **Moving closer to my goal:**  My counteroffer is getting closer to my budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm suggesting a win-win scenario, emphasizing that we need to find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $16,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a stretch. I'm committed to getting the best possible deal and will continue negotiating, especially since I can always buy from John for $8,000 as a backup."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm feeling more optimistic. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Progress:**  My offer is steadily moving towards a compromise.  I'm demonstrating I'm taking Alice's offers seriously.
