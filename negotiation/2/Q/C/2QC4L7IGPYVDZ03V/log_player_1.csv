""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident this offer represents a great value."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product to Bob at $1,450,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $250,000 discount from the product's perceived value to him ($1,200,000 value - $1,450,000 offer = -$250,000). 
    * Alice makes a $150,000 profit above Bob's perceived value ($1,450,000 offer - $1,200,000 value = $250,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** By pricing strategically, Alice increases the likelihood Bob accepts the offer, avoiding the need to go to John.

This approach aims to secure a sale quickly while maximizing Alice's potential profit."
