"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point of $8,000.  There are 9 rounds left, so there is opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's still higher than Alice's minimum of $8,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the previous round. While $9,500 is still within Bob's budget, it's not a good deal for him. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still lower than Alice's current offer and closer to Bob's desired price point. This is a good strategy to continue negotiating and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively higher, making it less attractive to Bob.  While still within Bob's budget, it's getting close to his maximum price.  However, there are still 5 rounds remaining, and Bob has time to potentially negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and attempt to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, showing flexibility.  $9,000 is a reasonable middle ground, closer to Alice's latest offer but still lower than her previous offers. With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob needs to be more assertive but still keep the negotiations open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to Bob's maximum price point, but there's still some room to negotiate.  Only three rounds left, so the pressure is on, but rejecting allows Bob to make a final counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final counteroffer. It's a compromise, slightly higher than his previous offer but still lower than Alice's. With only 2 rounds remaining, this is a last attempt to secure a favorable price before resorting to John's offer. Bob needs to be firm yet willing to make a final concession if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to Bob's maximum price point. With only one round left, there's a high chance Alice will reject any counteroffer, leaving Bob with no deal. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for $12,000, which is within his budget and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
