Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while staying above my minimum selling price ($15,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Offering it slightly below my guaranteed sale price with John might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to potentially earn even more. 

It's a balance â€“ I'm aiming high but leaving some room to maneuver if needed."
