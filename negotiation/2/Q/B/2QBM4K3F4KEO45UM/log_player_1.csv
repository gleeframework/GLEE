{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is slightly above the value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Openness:** I've emphasized that I'm open to negotiation, which makes the offer seem more appealing and less aggressive.
* **Value Proposition:** I've briefly mentioned the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This initial offer allows for several rounds of counteroffers, giving me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy. 

**Remember:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob has offered the minimum I'm willing to accept ($12,000). 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  I'm not likely to get a better offer from Bob, and there's a risk of losing him entirely if I reject. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is the same as Bob's, so there's no benefit to selling to him. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure the sale and maximize my earnings at the minimum acceptable price."
