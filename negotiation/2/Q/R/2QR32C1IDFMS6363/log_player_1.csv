Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could earn you more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but there's room for negotiation if he's interested. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing anything. You can confidently sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
