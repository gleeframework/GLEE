Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I'm confident it will yield substantial returns given its unique qualities.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this discussion. I appreciate you moving closer to a figure that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer, but I believe you're the ideal fit for this product. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I feel this is a fair reflection of its value and a price point that allows us both to benefit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me and recognizing the value of this product.  I've been very straightforward in our discussions. To be completely transparent, I have a firm offer for $1,500,000 from another party. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'd much rather see you benefit from this purchase. If you're willing to meet that $1,500,000 price, the deal is yours today.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown her hand. She won't go below $1,500,000, which is her value for the product.  It's very likely this ""other buyer"" is a negotiation tactic. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you a significant amount of money. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
