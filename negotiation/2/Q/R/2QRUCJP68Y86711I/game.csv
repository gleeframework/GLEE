"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially setting the price at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,300,000 is not feasible. I'd be willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I'm confident it will yield substantial returns given its unique qualities.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has potential, but $2,000,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. There's clearly a gap between our valuations.  I could go up to $950,000, but that's my limit for now.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this discussion. I appreciate you moving closer to a figure that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer, but I believe you're the ideal fit for this product. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I feel this is a fair reflection of its value and a price point that allows us both to benefit.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the explanation. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but that offer is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a fair return. Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me and recognizing the value of this product.  I've been very straightforward in our discussions. To be completely transparent, I have a firm offer for $1,500,000 from another party. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'd much rather see you benefit from this purchase. If you're willing to meet that $1,500,000 price, the deal is yours today. ",1500000.0,Alice,7,
