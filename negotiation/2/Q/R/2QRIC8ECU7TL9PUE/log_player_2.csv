"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You can reject it and explore other options, knowing that you can buy it from John for the same price."
