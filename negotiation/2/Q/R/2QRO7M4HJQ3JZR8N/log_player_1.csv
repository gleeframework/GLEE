Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $95 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is more than your minimum of $80, ensuring you get a decent profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $95 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've indicated you're open to negotiation, leaving the door open for a potential win-win scenario. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to Bob's value of $100 as possible without risking him walking away.  By offering $95, you're establishing a starting point that's fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a decent price, it's still lower than what I'd prefer to get.  Since I'm only slightly above my minimum with John's offer of $80, it's worth trying to get closer to Bob's value of $100. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $90? That's a fair price that should be good for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $95 to $90, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair offer:** $90 is still above my minimum and significantly closer to my ideal price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message is worded to imply that I'm still open to negotiation if necessary. 

This counteroffer balances the need to get a good price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $87.5 is only slightly below my minimum of $80. This means I'm not taking a huge loss by accepting.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer could build a good relationship for future transactions where I might be able to negotiate better prices.
* **Time factor:** Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing Bob and needing to settle for John's $80 offer.

Overall, while it's not perfect, accepting Bob's offer is a good balance between getting a decent price and avoiding further negotiation risk."
