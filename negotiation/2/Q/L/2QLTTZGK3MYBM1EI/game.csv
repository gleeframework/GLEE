"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. I'd like to propose a price closer to my valuation, which is $10,000. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $17,000 is too high for me. I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation, which is $15,000. I hope this helps us move forward towards a mutually agreeable solution.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is very close to what I had in mind. I appreciate you moving closer to my position. How about we settle this at $16,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $16,000 is slightly above my valuation. I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation, which is $15,000. I hope this helps us reach a fair agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
