"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $170,  no lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $70? That's a significant increase from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $150?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $150 is still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and John's offer.  It's unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile to continue the negotiation.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at a price you find acceptable."
