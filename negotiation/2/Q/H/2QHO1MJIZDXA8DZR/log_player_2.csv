"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $87.50 is within Bob's budget of $100. 
* This is a good compromise, as Bob is willing to spend up to $85.
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $2.50 compared to buying from John."
