Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,150,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:**  By offering a higher price, I show confidence in the value of the product and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob might counteroffer, and I am ready to negotiate further. 
* **Having a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not willing to settle for the lowest possible price yet. There's a good chance Bob is willing to go higher.  

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter:** By rejecting the offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  
* **Keep the pressure on:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I hope to increase the pressure on him to meet my expectations.
* **The backup plan:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a ""good deal"" for both parties.  
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in completely. 

**Strategy:**

* **Meet in the middle:** Offering a middle ground is often a good tactic in negotiation. 
* **Maintain a balance:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also showing flexibility. 
* **Preparation for next steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to either lower my price slightly or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll consider your suggestion. In that case, I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Accept and Move On:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Negotiating further could lead to a stalemate or a lower offer. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing a sale entirely. 

**Conclusion:**

This decision reflects a calculated balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale.  By accepting Bob's offer, I gain a profit of $75,000, which is a good outcome considering the potential risks of continued negotiation."
