"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I know it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a great deal. Let's keep the conversation going!",825000.0,Alice,3,
