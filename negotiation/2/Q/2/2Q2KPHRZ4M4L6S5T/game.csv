"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $700,000. Would that be workable?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
