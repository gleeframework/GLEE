"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but $14,000 is a bit above my ideal price point. Would you be willing to do $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially increasing the price. 
* **Time:**  The negotiation is already in round 3, and Bob wants to avoid going through too many rounds. 

Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John and ensures a relatively quick deal."
