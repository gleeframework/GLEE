"I understand that you've reached your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,000,000, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
