"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering it to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8750, which is a fair compromise. It's a significant step closer to your price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $8875 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let's close this deal. ",8875.0,Alice,5,
