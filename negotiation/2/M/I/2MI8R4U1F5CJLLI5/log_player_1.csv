Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. That's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering the product for $10,875.  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I think we can do better than $10,875. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to sell the product to John for $10,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
