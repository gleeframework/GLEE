"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering the product for $10,875.  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
