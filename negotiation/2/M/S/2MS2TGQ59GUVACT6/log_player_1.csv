"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and trying to build rapport.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage and consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I believe I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  I start by showing that I heard his offer and am willing to compromise.
* **Compromise and Justification:**  I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum. I also reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm trying to make the offer appealing and mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I am only able to pay $98. This is the most I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $98 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, there's a risk of losing the deal if I keep rejecting offers.  Selling to John would get me my minimum, but I'm taking a slight chance here and accepting Bob's offer."
