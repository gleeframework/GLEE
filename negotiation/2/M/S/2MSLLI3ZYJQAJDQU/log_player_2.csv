"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than Bob's maximum price of $120, there is potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value of $100."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am willing to consider $107 as the price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $107 is less than Bob's maximum of $120.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings:** While Bob could try to push for $105, there's no guarantee Alice will accept.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Accepting is the best strategy for maximizing savings:**  Accepting Alice's offer of $107 saves Bob $13 compared to buying from John."
