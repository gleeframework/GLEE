{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is calculated based on the following:

* **Bob's perceived value:**  $1,500,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000
* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000

By offering $1,400,000, I am:

* **Maximizing potential profit:** I'm aiming for a significantly higher profit than John's offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob has some room to negotiate down if he desires, while still giving me a substantial profit.
* **Minimizing risk:** While it's possible Bob rejects this offer, it's more likely he will accept due to the considerable value he places on the product."
