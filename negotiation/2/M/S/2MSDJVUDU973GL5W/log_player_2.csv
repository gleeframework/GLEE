"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Alice's offer means you pay $1,400,000.  This is less than the $1,500,000 you would pay to John. Even though Alice values the product at $1,000,000, it's still a better deal for you than buying from John."
