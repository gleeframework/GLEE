"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also ready to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,500. This is still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm running out of time, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can convince Bob to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John for $8,000 as I'm not willing to risk going any lower."
