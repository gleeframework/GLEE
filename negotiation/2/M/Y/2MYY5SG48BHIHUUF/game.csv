"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll pay $1,450,000, but I'd like to negotiate a 2% discount on the price. This would bring the price down to $1,415,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1415000.0,Bob,6,
