Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll pay $1,450,000, but I'd like to negotiate a 2% discount on the price. This would bring the price down to $1,415,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,500,000, Bob is clearly anchored around $1,450,000. Accepting his offer at $1,415,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away entirely."
