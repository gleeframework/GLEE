Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $10,000. I think you'll find this to be a fair and competitive price."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to start by aiming for the highest possible price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob finds $10,000 a little high, this initial offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle on a price higher than $8,000.
* **Strong and Confident Stance:**  By starting with a firm offer, you present yourself as confident in the product's value. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't have additional information about Bob's negotiation style or any urgency he might have to acquire the product."
