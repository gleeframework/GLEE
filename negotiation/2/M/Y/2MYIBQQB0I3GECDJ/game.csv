"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am not able to pay $950,000 for it. Based on my assessment, I am willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit and represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to my valuation, I still feel that we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. I am willing to increase my offer to $825,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while leaving room for us to continue our business relationship.",825000.0,Bob,4,
