"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you can likely get it for less than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $600,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $800,000 offer to $700,000.  This is closer to my desired price point, and while I could potentially negotiate further, it's not guaranteed Alice will go lower.  Accepting the offer saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal for me considering the product's value."
