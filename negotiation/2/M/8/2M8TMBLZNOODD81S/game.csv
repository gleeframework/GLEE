"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6000 and $12000. I'll offer $9000. I think that's a fair price for a product of this value.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",11000.0,Alice,5,
