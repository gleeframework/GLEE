# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  While $1,200,000 is a good deal, I can potentially save more by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the market value of $1,500,000.

Alice has moved closer to my offer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."

# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the market value. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and while I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting this offer allows me to save $250,000 compared to John's price."
