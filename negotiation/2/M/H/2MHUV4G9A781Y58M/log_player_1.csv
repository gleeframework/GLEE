Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for slightly less and still ensure Bob accepts, the goal is to maximize your profit. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Offering it at $1,400,000 gives him a $100,000 incentive to buy from you, while still netting you a significant gain over your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage in negotiating with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at the highest possible price and ensuring you don't lose the sale altogether."
