Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 9800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,800 is too low for me.  I'm open to a compromise. How about $10,500?  That's a significant reduction from my initial price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,250 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle at $10,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the significant reduction I've already made.
