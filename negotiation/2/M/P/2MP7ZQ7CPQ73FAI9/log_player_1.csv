Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
