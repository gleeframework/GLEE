"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to start with a high offer, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'm confident the product is valuable enough for Bob to consider this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to come down a bit, but still aim for a price closer to my initial offer.  I think $1,600,000 is a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting $1,450,000 is a good compromise and ensures I make a profit."
