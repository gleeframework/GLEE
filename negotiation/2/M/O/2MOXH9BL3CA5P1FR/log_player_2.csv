"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John if necessary."
