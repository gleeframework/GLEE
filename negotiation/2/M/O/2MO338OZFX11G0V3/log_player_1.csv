Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would give you a good profit, and it's within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
