"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This would give you a good profit, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product has the potential to generate substantial returns for you, and I'm confident of its value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,280,000. This feels like a fair deal that recognizes the true value of this product. What do you say?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
