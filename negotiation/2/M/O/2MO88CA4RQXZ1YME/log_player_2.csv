"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$6,000 is a good price, but it's still early in the negotiation.**  There's potential to get it even lower. 
* **Rejection allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.**  Their counteroffer will provide valuable information."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (4500) signals your strong desire for a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give you a strong indication of Alice's true selling point.  If she rejects, it means her price point is higher than expected, but it also gives you a baseline for future offers.
* **Room for Compromise:**  Even if this offer is rejected, there's still room to increase your offer progressively during the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,000 is still a good price, but it's still early in the negotiation.** There's still potential to get it lower.
* **Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation.**  Alice's counteroffer will give you more information on her price point and potential for compromise.
* **By continuing to reject, you're demonstrating your willingness to walk away if you don't get the best price.** This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you are willing to negotiate but not by a large margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** Alice has shown she's willing to come down, so we're seeing if she will come down further. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** A small increase keeps the pressure on Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,500 is closer to your desired price, but still slightly higher than where you'd like to be.** It's worth pushing for a lower price.
* **Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's still room for compromise.**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Time is on your side.**  You have 5 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're continuing to raise our offer incrementally, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Pressure on Alice:** With fewer rounds left, the pressure is mounting on Alice to make a decision. A smaller increase keeps the pressure on while showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will reveal if Alice is truly committed to a price close to $5,500 or if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, which suggests she's not willing to come down further.** However,  it's still below John's price, making it a potentially better deal.
* **We have three rounds left, so there's still time to continue negotiating.**  The goal is to see if Alice is willing to budge even a little bit. 
* **By rejecting, we can continue to pressure Alice and potentially get a better offer.** This keeps the negotiation dynamic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $6,200 and your previous offer of $5,200. It shows you're willing to meet her halfway.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the pressure is on both parties to find a solution. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Last Chance:** This could be the last chance for Alice to accept a lower price. If she rejects, you may have to accept her price or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** This is the second to last round.
* **Alice's price is too high:** Her offer of $6,500 is significantly higher than what you'd like to pay, and likely higher than her true value for the product.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  While not ideal, John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed way to acquire the product. 
* **Risk of Deadlock:**  If you reject Alice's offer, there is a high chance of reaching a deadlock, forcing you to accept John's higher price. 

It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price from John than risk a complete stalemate with Alice."
