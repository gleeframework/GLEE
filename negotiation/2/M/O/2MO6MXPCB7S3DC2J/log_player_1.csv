Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit. Bob gets a $5 discount (which is still a gain for him), and you make significantly more than selling to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal and maximizing your potential earnings."
