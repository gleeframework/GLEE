Round 4

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's clear he's trying to get the best possible deal and is unlikely to meet my $1,000,000 valuation in the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations dragging on or ending unsuccessfully."
