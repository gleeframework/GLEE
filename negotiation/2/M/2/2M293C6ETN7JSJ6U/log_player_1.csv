Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a price closer to my desired value.  

I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'll be prepared to use John's offer as a bargaining chip if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, it's closer to my desired value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price, but still allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk going back and forth any further.  I'm going to sell to John, as he's offering my minimum acceptable price."
