"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This is to give me some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my desired range. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial price of $180 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from $180 to $170. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $165. While it's still slightly lower than my desired price, it's getting closer and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to settle for the lower price from John."
