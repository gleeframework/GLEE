This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but allows for negotiation. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
