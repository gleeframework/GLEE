"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in this product but can't afford that price.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad to hear that you're interested in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $800000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1000000, but I need to stay within my budget.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in discussion. However, $1000000 is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000 as my final offer.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1300000, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
