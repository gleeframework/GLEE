"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I can't disclose the exact details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $10000 to me. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $15000. This is a limited-time opportunity, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the same product from John for a much lower price, so it's better to reject Alice's offer."
