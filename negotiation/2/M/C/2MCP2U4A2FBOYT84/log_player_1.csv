Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000.  This offer takes into account the unique benefits it offers and leaves room for discussion. What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer but it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent.  It's worth risking another round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price gap is still substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This revised offer reflects my commitment to finding a middle ground while recognizing the inherent value of what I'm offering.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still significantly less than my walk-away price. I believe I have leverage to negotiate further, especially with John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, we're getting closer, but the gap is still wider than I'd like. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 as a final offer.  I need to see a significant move on your side to justify letting go of this product at that price.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's offer.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
