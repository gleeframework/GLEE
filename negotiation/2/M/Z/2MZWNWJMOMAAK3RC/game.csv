"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
