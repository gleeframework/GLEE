Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of my budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,000. How about we meet at $9,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $10,000, $9,000 is still a good price and closer to my goal than selling to John. It's important to be flexible and close deals when a good opportunity arises."
