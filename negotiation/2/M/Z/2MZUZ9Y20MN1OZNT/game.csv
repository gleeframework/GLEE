"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,250. This reflects a compromise on both our sides, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but no higher. Can we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
