Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. I might adjust my price and message based on Bob's initial reaction and negotiating tactics."
