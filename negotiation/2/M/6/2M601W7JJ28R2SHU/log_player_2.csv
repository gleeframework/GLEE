"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $15000 for this product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's. There's no advantage to buying from Alice since there's no indication the product is worth more than $15,000.  It's safer to go with the guaranteed option of buying from John."
