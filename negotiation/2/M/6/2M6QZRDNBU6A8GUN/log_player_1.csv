Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire an asset of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Positioning the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and urgency.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, Alice can significantly lower the price in further negotiation or rely on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."
