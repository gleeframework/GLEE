Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects or counter-offers, you can adjust your strategy accordingly, knowing you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""significant value"" of the product aims to justify the higher price in Bob's mind."
