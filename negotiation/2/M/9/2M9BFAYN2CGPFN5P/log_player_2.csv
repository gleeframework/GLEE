"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $10,000. A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation and could be appealing enough for Alice to accept, especially if she wants to sell the product quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still less than buying from John, Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Alice is showing some flexibility by lowering her price, and Bob can use that to his advantage. A counteroffer might push her closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now closer to his desired price point, and he's likely to accept anything lower than $11,500. A counteroffer of $11,000 shows Bob is serious about a deal, while still leaving some room for Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her initial price, and her counteroffer is only slightly lower than her first one. It seems like Alice is more interested in selling at a price closer to her desired price point than securing a quick deal.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is too high.  It's better to buy the product from John for $15,000 and avoid potentially losing more time and energy trying to convince Alice to lower her price further."
