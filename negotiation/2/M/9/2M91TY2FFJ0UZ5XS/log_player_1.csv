Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer for Bob. He gains $1,500 in value (his perceived worth of $10,000 vs. the offered price).
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John, even if John's offer is slightly higher.  

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the knowledge of a guaranteed sale, encouraging Bob to accept a price beneficial for both parties."
