"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that exceeds your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique qualities and potential"" of the product, I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains collaborative and invites Bob's perspective, initiating a dialogue for negotiation.

This initial offer sets a strong tone and aims to understand Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above his actual valuation and provides room for further negotiation. I'm not willing to accept an offer that's $200,000 above what he values the product at. Selling to John is my safety net but not ideal at this stage, as I believe I can get a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and its potential returns. Could you consider $1,950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Compromise:** I'm making a relatively small concession of $50,000 to show a willingness to negotiate but remain firm on the value I place on the product.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential to subtly nudge Bob towards the higher end of his valuation.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The counteroffer aims for a middle ground,  signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal but not desperate enough to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now significantly below my target price. While he's attempting to negotiate, his latest offer suggests he might not be willing to meet me close to my desired range.  I'm willing to counter once more to gauge his seriousness, but selling to John is becoming a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand budget constraints, but my objective is to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  $1,700,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. My final offer is $1,850,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness and Finality:**  By stating ""my final offer,"" I'm communicating a clear boundary and indicating that I'm prepared to walk away if this price isn't met.
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value proposition and reiterating that my offer is fair and grounded in the product's potential.
* **Time Constraint:** Introducing a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision as we approach the halfway point in the negotiation.

This counteroffer balances firmness with flexibility, giving Bob a final opportunity to secure the product at a price that's still beneficial to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and not moving substantially toward my minimum acceptable price.  His offer of $1,650,000 is too far below my $1,850,000 ""final offer,"" making further negotiation unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. 

At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob carries more risk than potential reward. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, which ensures I meet my minimum acceptable price."
