{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to give myself some room for negotiation. I'm also being polite and respectful in my message, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $980,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept a price lower than $1,000,000 right now. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $980,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $990,000? I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 990000}
