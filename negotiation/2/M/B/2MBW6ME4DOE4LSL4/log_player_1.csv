Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while still leaving room for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount:** It's $3,000 less than the product's worth to Bob, making it attractive.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's $4,000 above your minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers and a mutually agreeable price.

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, you set a positive tone for the negotiation while still maximizing your potential profit."
