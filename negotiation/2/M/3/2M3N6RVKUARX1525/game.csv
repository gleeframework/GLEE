"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  I am still very interested but $825,000 is a little too high for my budget. Could we agree on $760,000? That would be a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $780,000? That would work for me.",780000.0,Bob,6,
