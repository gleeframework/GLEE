"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
This strategy aims to start high but leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the door open for a higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. However, the value this product brings is substantial. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're aiming for a win-win scenario.  By proposing $900,000, we're splitting the difference between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still striving for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's worth pushing a little further to maximize profit. We're still above John's offer, so the risk remains relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $890,000? This is a very competitive price considering the product's unique benefits."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($10,000 instead of $25,000) to signal that we're nearing our desired price point. We're still aiming to secure a price that reflects the product's value while acknowledging Bob's engagement in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving upward, but in smaller increments. This suggests we are nearing his maximum price. Accepting $880,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer ($80,000 more) and avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far. It's a strong deal at this point in the negotiation."
