"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $1,100,000.  You should reject and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? It's still a great price for a product worth so much to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,050,000.  While this is lower than her initial offer, it's still more than what you can get the product for from John ($1,000,000).  To save money, you should go with John."
