This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open. It's high enough that Bob might consider it, but it leaves room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low. I'll send him a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? It's still a great price for a product worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
