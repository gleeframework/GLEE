"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $60 was a bit low. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, and closer to what I had in mind.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
