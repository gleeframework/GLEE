Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob, Alice provides a reason for the higher price, making it more palatable. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice subtly implies other potential buyers exist, creating a sense of urgency without explicitly using a pressure tactic. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational, suggesting Alice is open to discussing the price further should Bob counter-offer. 
 
While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out entirely."
