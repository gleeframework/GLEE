"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a lower price, especially since your walk-away price from John is $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. Here's why:

* **Significant Drop:** It's a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling you're serious about a lower price.
* **Above Alice's Value:**  It's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000), giving her room to potentially make a profit.
* **Below Your Limit:** It keeps you comfortably below your $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this item to me is quite high. Could you do $11,000?  I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still a good margin away from a price I'd consider accepting. I'll try to push her a little further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($11,000) and my previous counteroffer ($10,500). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a good deal. 
* **Still Room to Move:**  While closer to my limit, this leaves a small buffer in case Alice is completely unwilling to go below $10,750.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" might nudge Alice towards closing the deal."
