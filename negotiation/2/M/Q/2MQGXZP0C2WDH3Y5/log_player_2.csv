"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You'd pay $12,000 instead of $15,000.
* **Alice still makes a profit:**  She's selling it for $12,000 and it's worth $8,000 to her, so she's making $4,000. 

This is the best outcome for Bob, as it gets him the product while saving the most money."
