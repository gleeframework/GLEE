Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he's not interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm trying to earn as much money as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll counteroffer with a price of $110. This is a bit higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's counteroffer of $90 was a bit too low, so I'm going to try to get closer to my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer of $105.

{""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $95 is still a bit lower than my initial price, but it's getting closer. I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to get a better price.

I'll counteroffer with a price of $102. This is a bit higher than Bob's offer, and it's getting closer to my initial price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 102}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's offer of $95 was a bit too low, so I'm going to try to get closer to my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer of $98.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my initial price, and it's getting harder to reject it. However, I'm still trying to earn as much money as possible, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a slightly better price.

I'll counteroffer with a price of $99. This is just 2 dollars more than Bob's offer, and it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 99}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's offer of $97 was a bit too low, but my counteroffer of $99 was rejected. I'll try to get closer to my initial price again.

I'll make a new counteroffer of $100. This is the same price that John is willing to pay, and it's getting close to my initial price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price.
