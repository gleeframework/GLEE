Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal without forcing him to accept a price he finds unacceptable.
* **Protecting My Interest:** It also allows me to potentially achieve a higher price than what I would get from John while still keeping the option of selling to John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option of securing a higher price while still keeping John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $950,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" to encourage acceptance while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  This strategy aims to maximize the potential of securing a higher price while minimizing the risk of a prolonged negotiation or having to settle for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. Based on my financial considerations, I am able to offer $960000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  Bob's offer of $960,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've been through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer further. 
* **Selling to John is Safe:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  

While I'm open to negotiation, it's becoming clear that a deal with Bob won't reach my target price.  Therefore, I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate or potentially move forward with selling to John as a secure option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $960,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, and offer you the product for $970,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is framed as my final offer, signaling a firm stance and potentially encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Slight Concession:**  The offer is a small concession from my previous one, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  This gives Bob a sense of urgency and potentially motivates him to accept before I move on.
* **Balancing Risk:**  This approach balances the risk of delaying the sale further with the potential of getting closer to my target price.  It also allows me to potentially reject any further counteroffers from Bob, giving me the option to sell to John if a deal with Bob doesn't materialize."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I am willing to increase my offer to $965000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:**  Bob's offer of $965,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** It's becoming clear that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, selling to John is the most sensible decision.  It minimizes risk, ensures a profitable deal, and avoids potentially prolonging the negotiation process with Bob."
