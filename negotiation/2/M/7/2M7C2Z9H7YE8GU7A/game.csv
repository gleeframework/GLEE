"I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $125. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
