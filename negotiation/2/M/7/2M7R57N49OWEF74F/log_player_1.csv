"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening that shows confidence in the product's value.  While I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and a strong starting point for further negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's.  It's not worth it to continue negotiating with Bob at this point. I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $800,000.  There's a risk that Bob might come back with a better offer later, but I'm not willing to gamble and potentially end up with nothing."
