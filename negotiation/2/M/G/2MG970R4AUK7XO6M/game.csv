"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1200000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1100000 to you. Considering your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that I might need to explore other options. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1075000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. If not, I may have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

However, I want to remind you that John is still waiting in the wings, willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I'm willing to give you a chance to make a decision, but I need to know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
