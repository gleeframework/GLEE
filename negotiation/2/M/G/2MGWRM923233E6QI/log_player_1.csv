"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $12,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk by starting high.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is a solid backup option. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's only a bit higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible and willing to meet him halfway, and that it encourages him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. It's very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get a little more.  John's offer is also a good safety net.  I'll counter again and see if I can get Bob to go just a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm serious about wanting to close the deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as we're now very close to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for several rounds, and it seems like we're at an impasse. He's not budging on his $11,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $11,500. John's offer of $12,000 is a sure thing, and it's a good deal for me. It's time to move on and avoid further risk."
