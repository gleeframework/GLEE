"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110?  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's compromise: $108. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my minimum.  What do you say?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at or below that price. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
