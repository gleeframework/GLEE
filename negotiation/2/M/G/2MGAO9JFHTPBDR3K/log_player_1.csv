"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've seen similar products in the market for that price, and I'd like to get a good deal on this one. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110?  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's compromise: $108. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my minimum.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at or below that price. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been trying to get a better price from Bob, but it seems like we're at a standstill. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might lose interest entirely. To avoid losing out on the sale altogether, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This is my minimum price, and it ensures I don't lose money on the deal."
