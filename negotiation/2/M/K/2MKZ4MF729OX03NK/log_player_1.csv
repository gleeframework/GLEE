"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer by saying ""What do you think?"". 

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping to get a decent price in the first round, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my max budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting such a low offer would result in a significant loss.  

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is far below what I need to sell it for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $125, which is the midpoint between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($80).  
* **Negotiation Tactic:** This counteroffer shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly, emphasizing the value of the product and the desire to reach a fair agreement. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by adding ""I think that's a fair price for both of us."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $95?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, accepting such a low offer would leave me with a significant loss.  

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's try $110. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $110, which is closer to my desired range but still a compromise from my previous offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (costs) and emphasize the compromise aspect to show good faith.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly, focusing on finding a solution that works for both parties. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by saying ""I think it's a price we can both be happy with.""

**Strategy:** I'm trying to narrow the gap between our offers while still ensuring I get a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $95.  I think it's a fair compromise and a price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his offer of $95, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've made several compromises, but it's clear we are not going to reach an agreement.  

To avoid losing out on a better deal, I will sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids further time wasted in a negotiation that is unlikely to be successful."
