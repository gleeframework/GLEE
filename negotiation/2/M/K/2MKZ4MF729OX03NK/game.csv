"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my max budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is far below what I need to sell it for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $95?  That would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's try $110. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $95.  I think it's a fair compromise and a price that allows us both to walk away happy.",95.0,Bob,6,
