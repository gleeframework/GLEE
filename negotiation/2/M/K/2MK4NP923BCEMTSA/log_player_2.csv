"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slightly discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $75 is a decent price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. There's a chance to save a few more dollars before resorting to buying from John at full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice met in the middle.  $70 is a good price, and further haggling might irritate her and risk losing the deal. It's best to accept now and secure a decent discount."
