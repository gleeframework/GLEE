"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $140. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and get a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start the negotiation and attempt to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it gives you a great product for a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price:** While $135 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. 
* **There's room for more negotiation:** You have 7 rounds remaining, and you're already seeing Alice become more flexible. 

By rejecting the offer again, you can continue the negotiation and try to push for a price closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $132. If you're open to it, let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 132}
