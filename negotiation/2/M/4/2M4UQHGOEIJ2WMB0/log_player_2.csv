# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds immense value for us at $12,000, but considering its potential impact on your endeavors, we believe it could be an excellent investment for you. We're offering this exceptional product to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This opportunity is exclusive and tailored to recognize your discerning taste and strategic vision.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially leading to a lower counter-offer."
