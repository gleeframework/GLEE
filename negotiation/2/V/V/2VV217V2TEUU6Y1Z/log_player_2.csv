"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can still save $75,000 by rejecting and negotiating further with Alice, or potentially finding another seller.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price, but the risk of paying $925,000 is greater than the risk of potentially finding a lower price."
