"Hey Bob, thanks for your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $120 is still a little bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
