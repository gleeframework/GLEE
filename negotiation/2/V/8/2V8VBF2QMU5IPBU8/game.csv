,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can we agree on that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, as I mentioned before. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
