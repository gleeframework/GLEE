Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, subtly suggesting he'd be getting a good deal even at this price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer.
* **Safety Net:**  I'm aware of the John option, which gives me a fallback in case negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is too low.  While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly below the value of the product to me (at least $1,000,000).
* **Opportunity for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Approach:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing the $1,100,000 price as a ""meeting in the middle,"" implying it's a fair compromise.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,100,000, he's getting a good deal considering the product's value to him.
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** I'm still holding out for a price that's significantly higher than John's offer, giving me room to negotiate further."
