"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

There's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  Since John is willing to sell for the same price ($1,500,000), it's the most logical choice to avoid the risk of a longer negotiation with Alice."
