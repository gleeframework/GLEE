"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1,800,000, which reflects its true potential. Let's discuss this further!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to create a good first impression and make Bob feel valued.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I signal a willingness to negotiate by inviting Bob to discuss the offer further. 

This strategy aims to establish a strong starting point and gauge Bob's interest while leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 meets my minimum, I have 10 rounds and can potentially get a better price.  

* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  
* **Assessing Value:** I need to gauge Bob's true interest and see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Sell:**  Selling to John now guarantees $1,200,000 but might miss out on a better deal with Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects its true value. Would you consider $1,500,000? This would still be a significant savings compared to my initial offer, and I believe it would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing the savings compared to my first offer.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm still leaving room for negotiation in case Bob is unwilling to meet my counteroffer.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while remaining within my desired price range.  I'm hopeful that Bob will be persuaded by the lower price and the emphasis on a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob has remained firm at $1,200,000, and my counteroffers have not swayed him.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to act decisively. Continuing to negotiate risks losing valuable time and potentially not reaching a better deal.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum price of $1,200,000.  This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and a possible lower price.

While I would prefer to earn more, the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potential lower prices outweighs the potential benefit.  Selling to John now ensures I receive my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
