"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still well above your proposed price.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than what you can get from John.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and avoiding the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a dead end."
