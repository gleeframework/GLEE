Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,100,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to engage in discussion, showing flexibility and encouraging a potential deal. 
* **Plan B:**  Remember, I have a backup buyer in John, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows a willingness to negotiate.  I can likely get a better price by countering.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, which gives me a strong negotiating position.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still well above your proposed price.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's perceived value, and much closer to my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to maintain leverage.
* **Highlight value:** I emphasize that this is a ""significant discount"" from my initial offer to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Open to further discussion:** The message concludes with ""Let's see if we can reach a compromise"", inviting further negotiation."
