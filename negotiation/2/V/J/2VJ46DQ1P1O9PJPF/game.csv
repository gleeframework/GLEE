"Thank you for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be happy to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $155? That seems like a fair compromise.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I can do $157.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  How about $152.50?  That seems like a good midpoint between our last offers.",152.5,Bob,6,

"I'm still not quite there, but I'm getting closer. How about we meet at $158? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit.",158.0,Alice,7,
