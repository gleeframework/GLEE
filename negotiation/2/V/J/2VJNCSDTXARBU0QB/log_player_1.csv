Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price. However, I'm willing to offer you a special price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's in my best interest to see if I can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the price and increase his willingness to pay.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while acknowledging that Bob might reject the offer, in which case I still have a secure sale with John."
