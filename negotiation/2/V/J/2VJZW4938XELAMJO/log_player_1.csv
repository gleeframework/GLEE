Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's significantly lower than what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price for the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and it's not worth risking losing a better deal with John. It's time to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While your offer is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and I would be able to move this product quickly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
