Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest without revealing desperation to sell. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I invite Bob to respond and potentially make a counteroffer, giving us more information to work with.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is too low. You know you can get $100 from John, so accepting $80 would be a significant loss. Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price, closer to your minimum or even John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. Could you meet me halfway at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $100, we're showing Bob we're willing to negotiate while simultaneously anchoring the price at our minimum acceptable point. 
* **Strong Position:** Since we have John as a backup buyer at $100, we don't need to go any lower.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct about the price difference while proposing a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am unable to meet you at $100. My maximum budget for this product remains at $80. Would you be willing to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge from his $80 offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will change his mind. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, it's in your best interest to take the sure thing rather than risk losing both offers."
