Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed price from John).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $1,450,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By stating you're offering it at a ""premium price,"" you set a tone that this is a valuable item.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Confident Close:** Expressing confidence in the product's worth can subtly influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:**  This is just one offer strategy. You could start lower and allow Bob to negotiate up, but the key is to aim high initially."
