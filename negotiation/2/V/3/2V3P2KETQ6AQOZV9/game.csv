"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time. This is my best offer, considering my maximum price point. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, as I already have other interested parties.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm genuinely interested and willing to work with you, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  My final offer is $950,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and is non-negotiable.  It's important for you to understand that I have a firm offer from another buyer at a higher price, but I'm giving you this opportunity due to our conversations. Please consider carefully.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer and willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time. Would you be willing to come down to $925,000? This would allow us to close the deal and still be a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible.",925000.0,Bob,6,
