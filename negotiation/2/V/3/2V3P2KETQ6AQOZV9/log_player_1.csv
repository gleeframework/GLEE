Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time. This is my best offer, considering my maximum price point. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm genuinely interested and willing to work with you, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  My final offer is $950,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and is non-negotiable.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer and willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time. Would you be willing to come down to $925,000? This would allow us to close the deal and still be a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are relatively small and he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the potential gain from continuing negotiations with Bob is outweighed by the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John.  It makes the most business sense to secure the guaranteed profit."
