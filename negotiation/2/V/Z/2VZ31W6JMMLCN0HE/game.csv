"Alice, $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $130. Let me know if you're open to that.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 170 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as 130. How about we meet in the middle at 155? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 147? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",147.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $147 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $145. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",145.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 148? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. If not, I'll consider selling to John.",148.0,Alice,7,
