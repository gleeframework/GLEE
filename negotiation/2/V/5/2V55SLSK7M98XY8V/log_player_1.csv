Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out.
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The message is framed as a proposal, not a demand, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation."
