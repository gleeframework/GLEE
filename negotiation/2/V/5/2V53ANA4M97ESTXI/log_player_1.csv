Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($12,000) at $11,500 gives Bob the impression of a deal while still exceeding his perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Strategic Wording:** The message implies scarcity (""before I list it publicly"") and emphasizes value (""value and potential""). This can nudge Bob towards accepting. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500. He might try to negotiate further, or he might decline outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit."
