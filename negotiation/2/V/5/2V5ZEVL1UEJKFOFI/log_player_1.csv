""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** Offering a price closer to $1,500,000 might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of, potentially leading to rejection. This offer aims for a mutually beneficial agreement."
