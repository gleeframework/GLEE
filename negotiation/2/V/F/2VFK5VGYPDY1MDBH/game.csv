"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $800,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand your budgetary constraints.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to see the price come down, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
