"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000, but it's getting closer.  However, if Bob rejects this offer and makes another counteroffer, he risks Alice rejecting it and potentially increasing the price again. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer, as he's getting a decent price and saving himself further negotiation."
