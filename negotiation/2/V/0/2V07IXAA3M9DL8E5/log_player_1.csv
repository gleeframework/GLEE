"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for a good starting point while also leaving some space for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could sell to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $8,250. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. To be fair, how about splitting the difference again and settling at $7,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to a deal with Bob, but I'm starting to run out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing a sale.  Since I can sell to John for $8,000, I'll take the guaranteed sale and end the negotiation with Bob."
