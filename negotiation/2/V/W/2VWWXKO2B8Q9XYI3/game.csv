"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to drop to $10,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and for you to make a profit.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make this one last compromise.",11250.0,Alice,5,
