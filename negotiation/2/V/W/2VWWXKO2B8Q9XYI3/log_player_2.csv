"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can potentially get the price lower than $11,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to your goal, you're still above your desired price. It's worth seeing if you can push Alice lower with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make this one last compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice has already made her final offer.  While $11,250 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your limit of $10,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John and save yourself the hassle of further negotiations."
