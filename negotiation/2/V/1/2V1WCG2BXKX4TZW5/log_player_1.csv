Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, hoping to find a middle ground."

Bob is firm on his offer, and I've already made a significant concession.  I don't think there's much room for further negotiation, and it's getting late in the game.  To avoid risking losing the deal entirely, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
