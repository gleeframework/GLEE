Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to potentially gain more than Bob's perceived value if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** A high starting point demonstrates confidence in your product's value while still giving you space to come down if necessary.

By starting high, you gather valuable information about Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? This would align better with my financial planning. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, it's equal to your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate. Since you started high, there's a chance Bob might be willing to meet somewhere in the middle. Rejecting his offer and providing a counter-offer allows you to explore this possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  To find a middle ground, I could offer the product for $12,000. This price reflects the product's true value while still providing you a significant discount."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between your initial asking price and Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""true value"" and ""significant discount,"" you re-emphasize the product's worth while acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you've come down in price, there's still space for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on a price of $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is a $1,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting he's reaching his upper limit.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could try for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially losing the sale to John, who would only offer your minimum."
