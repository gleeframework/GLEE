"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750,000, reflecting a fair market value for this product. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, and offer $800,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your maximum. It's risky to continue negotiating, as you're getting close to the end of your rounds, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept your next counteroffer.  It's best to secure the product from John at your target price."
