Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price significantly above Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell yourself short.
* **Strategic Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's perceived value, it hints at the product's high worth to encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial price or negotiates down only slightly, you secure a profit significantly higher than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, you can gradually lower it, gauging his reactions and moving closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000)."
