You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to you, Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $30 discount is a strong opening move, but it still leaves room for compromise. I believe this price is reasonable and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $110 is still higher than my limit. I'm not willing to accept a price above $100, but I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to meet her halfway. It's a compromise that still keeps me within my budget and hopefully brings us closer to an agreement."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my $100 limit. I'm determined to negotiate further and see if I can get a price that works for me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum price for the product. I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope Alice accepts it.  If she doesn't, I'll buy from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating."
