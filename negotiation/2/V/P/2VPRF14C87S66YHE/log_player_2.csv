"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since both Alice and John are offering the product for the same price ($150), it doesn't matter who you buy from.  You're still saving the same amount of money either way.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is a valid decision."
