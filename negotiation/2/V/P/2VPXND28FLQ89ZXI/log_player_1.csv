"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I believe the product is valuable and I want to see if Bob is truly interested. If he's not willing to pay close to my desired price, I'll have the option to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still leaving room for some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can get closer to my goal price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal, but still maintaining a price higher than Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little below my initial goal, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, or even a rejection from Bob.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is also an option, but $1,750,000 is a better deal and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
