"Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $7,000? I believe this price point reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $8,200.
