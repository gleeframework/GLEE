Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $12,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $12,000 if Bob declines.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's optimal strategy is to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly above Bob's valuation, knowing that she has a guaranteed sale at her desired price with John. This approach maximizes her potential profit while still leaving a small chance that Bob might accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I'm asking for $10,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **Profit Potential:**  There's a chance Bob might value the immediacy of the purchase and accept the $10,500 price.
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired price of $12,000.
