"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $800000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.",850000.0,Alice,1,
