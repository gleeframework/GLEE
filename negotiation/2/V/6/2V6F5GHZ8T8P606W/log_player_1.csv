{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1250000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I know the product is worth more to him, and I have 8 rounds to try and negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1075000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you and remains within my financial constraints.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that a bit more negotiation can get us closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,075,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can move forward from here."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1125000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1100000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it gets us closer to a deal and allows you to profit from the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close, and we only have 4 rounds left.  It's better to accept this offer than risk another counteroffer from Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
