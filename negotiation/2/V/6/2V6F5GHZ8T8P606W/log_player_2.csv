Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1150000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1075000 still doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1125000?
