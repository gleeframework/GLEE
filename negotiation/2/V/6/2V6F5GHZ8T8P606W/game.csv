"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. It's a significant opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1250000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1150000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1075000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you and remains within my financial constraints.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1075000 still doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1125000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can move forward from here.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1125000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1100000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, as it gets us closer to a deal and allows you to profit from the sale.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
