"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $127. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",127.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $123. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $128. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to pay $128. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying it from someone else.",125.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $126. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",126.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not convinced that $126 is the best deal. I'm willing to meet you at $124, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to buy the product from John for $150.",124.0,Bob,10,
