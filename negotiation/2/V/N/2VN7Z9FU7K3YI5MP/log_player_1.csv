"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
 ""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price close to the maximum. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price and creating a sense of exclusivity.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price seems a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value.  Accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and we have room to maneuver. 

By rejecting this low offer, we signal that we are serious about the product's value and are willing to negotiate further to reach a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value at  $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've significantly lowered our asking price from $1,450,000 to $1,350,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, we are still well above Bob's initial offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""fair compromise,"" we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price point. 
* **Open Communication:**  We end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob's engagement and assess his willingness to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While we could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, accepting now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away in subsequent rounds."
