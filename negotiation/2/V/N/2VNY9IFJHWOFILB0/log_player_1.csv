Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as much money as possible. Since John acts as a price floor at $1,200,000, we want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while still netting you a considerable profit. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** If Bob rejects the offer, we're secure knowing John will buy it for our minimum acceptable price.

This strategy balances risk and reward by attempting to secure a higher price from Bob while having a guaranteed sale to John as a fallback."
