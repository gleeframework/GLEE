"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about $15000? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his preferred price point. There's room for further negotiation, and he should try to get closer to his target of $10,000."
