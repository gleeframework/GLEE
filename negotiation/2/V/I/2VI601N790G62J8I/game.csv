"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product fits my needs, but I need to be mindful of my spending.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $11,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient and reasonable, and I respect that you have a bottom line. $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000 even? I know it's a bit below what you were hoping for, but it would allow me to make the purchase today.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is a $2,000 value. This way, you'll get an even better deal than you initially thought. I'm sticking to my price of $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,7,
