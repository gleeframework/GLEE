Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very patient and reasonable, and I respect that you have a bottom line. $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000 even? I know it's a bit below what you were hoping for, but it would allow me to make the purchase today."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is a $2,000 value. This way, you'll get an even better deal than you initially thought. I'm sticking to my price of $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer includes additional perks, it's crucial to focus on the overall cost. Even with a $2,000 value add-on, the price remains at $13,500, exceeding your $12,000 limit. John's offer of $12,000 is the better financial decision at this point."
