"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $12,000 price from John, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000). Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal outcome. Bob should continue to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can send another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price closer to his target of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has rejected Alice's offer of $9,700 and is now offering $9,000. This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and his last counteroffer. It's still a significant saving for Bob compared to John's offer, and it shows willingness to negotiate further. This move increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $9,800 is only slightly better than her previous offer and is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price. Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a lower price that significantly benefits Bob. Considering the time and effort spent negotiating, buying from John for $12,000 is the more practical choice for Bob at this point. He can secure the product quickly and avoid further negotiation with Alice. While it's not the ideal price, it's within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
