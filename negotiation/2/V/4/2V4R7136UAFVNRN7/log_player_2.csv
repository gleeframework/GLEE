"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal and will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to buy from John for $150."
