"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $9,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your patience. I want to make this work for both of us. How about we settle at $14,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $14,000 is closer, I'm afraid my budget is firm.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's make this easy - $12,750, and we have a deal.  This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",12750.0,Alice,7,
