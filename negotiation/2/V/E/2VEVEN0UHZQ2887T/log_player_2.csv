Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's make this easy - $12,750, and we have a deal.  This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $12,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation rounds when you can secure the product at your target price right now."
