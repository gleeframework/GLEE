"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think! If you decline, I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it at full value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $800,000. While Alice claims to have another buyer, there's no guarantee that's true, and it shouldn't influence your decision given your fallback option with John."
