"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could go up to $7,000. That's a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
