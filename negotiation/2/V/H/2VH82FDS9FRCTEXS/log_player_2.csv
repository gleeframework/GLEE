"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than the $120 from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. I am willing to sell the product for $108. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $108 is significantly less than that. 
* **Saving:** This offer represents a savings of $12 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:** While there might be potential for further negotiation, there's a risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially ending up buying from John at $120. 

Accepting this offer maximizes Bob's savings while ensuring he gets the product."
