"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Even though Alice is trying to pressure you, her offer of $1,400,000 is still cheaper than John's offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Your goal is to save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
