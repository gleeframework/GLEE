"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,200 for it, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm happy to go up to $8,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,800. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",8800.0,Alice,5,
