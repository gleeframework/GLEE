"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the market value is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer is the lowest price you'll get for the product. While her mention of market value is just a negotiation tactic,  $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget and significantly cheaper than buying from John."
