Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a fair starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value, but still allows room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the value of the product and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This offer allows for a potential negotiation with Bob while keeping my minimum price in mind. I can always resort to selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* While I want to get the best price, I also don't want to lose out entirely. 
* Rejecting his offer allows me to try and counteroffer, hoping to reach a more mutually agreeable price. 

If the counteroffer process doesn't lead to a satisfactory result, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I've lowered my price slightly from my initial offer of $12,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* $11,000 is still a good price for me, as it's above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. 
* The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to see the benefit of a deal at $11,000. 
* I'm still open to further negotiation if Bob is unwilling to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. Would you consider $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,200 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.
*  Selling to John for $15,000 would be ideal, but this offer ensures a relatively good outcome with minimal risk."
