"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, and you have the option to buy from John for $150. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can always fall back on buying from John."
