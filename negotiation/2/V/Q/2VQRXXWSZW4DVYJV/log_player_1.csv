I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? This is a great deal for you, and it's still within my price range."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm running out of time.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price if we can't agree, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking a lower offer from Bob."
