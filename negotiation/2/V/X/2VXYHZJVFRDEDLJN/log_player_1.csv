Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $110 offer allows for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my minimum profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a successful sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I'm confident I can get a better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I have room to negotiate.
* **Protecting My Value:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit. However, I want to see if I can do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $100, but that's my final offer.  This product is really worth it, and I think it's a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($90) and my previous offer ($110).
* **Finality:** I'm communicating this as my final offer to put pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've made a successful sale at a price closer to my desired goal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob would likely involve more rounds of counteroffers, consuming time and effort. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is my minimum requirement. This is a safe and secure option.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid further negotiation."
