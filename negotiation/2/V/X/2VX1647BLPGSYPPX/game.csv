"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $880,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a great deal.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm eager to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
