"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to Bob's perceived value while still earning significantly more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round.  $90 is still below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for further negotiations. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves me room to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product. I'll try to meet him in the middle again with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is approaching my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm not sure if Bob is serious about wanting the product, but I believe I can still negotiate a bit higher. If this offer is rejected, I'll likely have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling you're not truly interested in buying this product at a fair price.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  If you're serious, I'll accept $96 for the product.  But if you decline again, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $88 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is just $8 above what I can get from John.  With only two rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
