"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves me room to make a profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling you're not truly interested in buying this product at a fair price.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  If you're serious, I'll accept $96 for the product.  But if you decline again, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $88 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price",88.0,Bob,8,
