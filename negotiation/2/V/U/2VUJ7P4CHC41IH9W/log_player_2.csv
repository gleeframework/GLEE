"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. If you reject Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further. You always have the safety net of buying from John for $120."
