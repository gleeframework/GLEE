"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer above your target price. This allows room for concessions and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if the offer is unrealistic, it can influence his perception of what's a reasonable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The large gap between the initial offer and Bob's perceived value gives us space to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

By starting high, we aim to understand Bob's negotiation style, gauge his interest, and set the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both our valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's clear we need to negotiate further. While selling to John is an option, we still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We've made a substantial reduction from our initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. However, the new price still keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will gauge Bob's seriousness and give us a clearer indication of his negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However,  $1,400,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer, given the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by only $100,000, indicating a reluctance to move significantly towards our price range. At this pace, reaching an acceptable agreement within the remaining rounds seems unlikely. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of selling to John for $1,200,000. While we want to maximize our earnings, continuing to negotiate with Bob at this slow rate might not be the most strategic use of our time and could result in a less favorable outcome. 

We'll reject Bob's offer, but in the next round, we need to signal our willingness to walk away if he doesn't present a more reasonable counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the market value.  However, there's a significant gap between our positions, and I need to be realistic about my options.  My final offer is $1,200,000. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear that this is our last price. This introduces a sense of urgency and emphasizes the need for Bob to make a serious counter-offer.
* **Justification:** We're not explicitly mentioning John, but we're alluding to the fact that we have other options if an agreement can't be reached.
* **Meeting Our Minimum:** This offer is our absolute minimum â€“ the same amount John is offering.  We're willing to accept this to avoid the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob, but we're prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet us at this price point."
