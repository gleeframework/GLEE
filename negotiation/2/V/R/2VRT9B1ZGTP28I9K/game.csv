"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference - $1,125,000 -  and make this deal happen. ",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000. How about $1,090,000? Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
