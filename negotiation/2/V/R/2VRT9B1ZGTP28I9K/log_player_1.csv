Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I've priced it at $1,150,000, reflecting its significant value.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the $1,000,000 offer from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference - $1,125,000 -  and make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my price, his offer is still too low. I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile, and I'm not ready to give in just yet. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000. How about $1,090,000? Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,080,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would ideally like a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's also a significant increase from his previous offer.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a much higher price. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable deal."
