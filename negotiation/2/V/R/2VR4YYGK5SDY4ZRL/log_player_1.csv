Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering at $100 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. Even if he counters at $90, Alice still makes a profit.
* **Considering the Alternative:** While John offers a safety net at $80, aiming higher with Bob might lead to a more profitable outcome."
