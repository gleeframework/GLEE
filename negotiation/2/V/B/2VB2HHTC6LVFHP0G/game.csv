"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I still think the product is worth more to me.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $925,000 is still a little too far from what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $960,000 for the product.
