Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is slightly below your minimum acceptable value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to you, subtly implying you're not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  You have room to negotiate and can likely get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price and works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is your minimum acceptable value.  While you could potentially negotiate further, accepting his offer ensures a sale and guarantees you the minimum profit you're looking for."
