Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good price, he can potentially save more money by counter-offering.  He should aim for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $8,000."

This price reflects the quality and value it offers while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still aiming for a price closer to $8,000, and Alice is already coming down in price. A counteroffer will hopefully lead to a price closer to his goal."
