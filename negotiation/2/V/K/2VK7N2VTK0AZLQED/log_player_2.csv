"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is not going lower than $100. Since John offers the same product for $100, there's no benefit to further negotiation with Alice.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
