Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $150 but leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only slightly below my initial offer and still significantly higher than my minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures I make a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
