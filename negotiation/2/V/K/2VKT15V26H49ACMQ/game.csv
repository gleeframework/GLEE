"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1520000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal - I'll also purchase an additional service from you for $50000. So, my total offer is $1450000 for the product and the service. I think this is a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for the additional offer, Bob. I appreciate the extra value you're willing to provide. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1560000, and I'll throw in the additional service for free. This is my final offer.",1560000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $1000000 might be a better option for me. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
