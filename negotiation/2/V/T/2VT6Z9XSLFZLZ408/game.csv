"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000.

I can offer you a price of $19000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.
