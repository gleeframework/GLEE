"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
