Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $8,000, so $10,000 is a price he might consider. 
* **It's lower than your fallback value:** You can still get $12,000 from John, so you're not losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price."
