"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,900? It's only a small step up from your offer and it gets us both closer to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
