Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 represents a more accurate reflection of the product's value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000, which is the price I've been eyeing? It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob seems firmly set at $1,200,000.  Since I have another buyer (John) willing to pay that price, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
