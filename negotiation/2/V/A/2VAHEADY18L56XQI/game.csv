"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table, and to make this work, I need the numbers to make sense. I can do $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you have another offer on the table, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This product is still worth a significant amount to me, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
