Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.
