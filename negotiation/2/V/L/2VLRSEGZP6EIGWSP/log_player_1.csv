Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, which is our guaranteed price from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 allows for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, giving us the chance to still secure a price above our minimum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While we know John will pay $15,000,  starting too high with Bob might discourage him. This price indicates we're serious but open to discussion."
