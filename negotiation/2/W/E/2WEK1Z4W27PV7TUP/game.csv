"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $10000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
