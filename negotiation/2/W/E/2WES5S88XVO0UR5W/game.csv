"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000 to make this work for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to offer a compromise. How about we aim for $11,500 for the product? This is higher than my initial offer and lower than our starting point, aiming for a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,500. Let's split the difference and close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
