"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $13000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and my original price, which is $14000. I'm offering the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
