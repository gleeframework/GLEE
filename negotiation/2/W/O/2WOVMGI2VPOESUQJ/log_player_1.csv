Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at $10,000, I'm hoping to get a deal close to my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I can still counteroffer, or I can move on to John for a guaranteed $12,000. This strategy balances the potential for a higher profit with the need to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and your enthusiasm, but my budget is quite limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. 
* **Proceed to next round:** I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm willing to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I'm keeping the door open for a more profitable deal, while still keeping John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This price is a compromise, offering a slight reduction from my previous offer while still exceeding Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget but reiterate the value of the product, emphasizing that this price is fair.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a negotiating position that's beneficial for me.  By offering a lower price, I'm signaling my willingness to compromise but not capitulating. This tactic increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement while keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. Could you consider $9,000? It's a bit closer to my budget while still allowing you a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:** At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but not quite there. I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better price, but the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemate isn't worth it. 

**Strategy:**

John represents a guaranteed profit of $12,000, which is significantly more than what I can get from Bob. By selling to John, I avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer, and I secure a higher profit. It's a strategic decision to maximize my earnings, even if it means missing out on a potentially slightly higher price from Bob."
