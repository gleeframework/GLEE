Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob without losing the guaranteed $120 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below John's buying price ($119) creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gets a perceived ""deal"" since it's more than he values it at ($100), and you gain an extra $19 compared to selling to John directly. 

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Exploits Value Difference:** Bob values the product less than you and John, but there's still a price point where it makes sense for him to buy.
* **Time Value:**  By offering a price Bob is likely to accept, you avoid the potential delay of going to John."
