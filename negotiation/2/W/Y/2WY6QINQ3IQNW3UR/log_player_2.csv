"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $9,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than his maximum willingness to pay. He can try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target price of $8,000."
