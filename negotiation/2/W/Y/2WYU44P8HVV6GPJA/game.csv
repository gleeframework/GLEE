"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $9,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  It's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $10,250. This is a bit closer to your target, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
