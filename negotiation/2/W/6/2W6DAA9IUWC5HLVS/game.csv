"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise. This offer is still significantly less than what I'd receive from another buyer, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
