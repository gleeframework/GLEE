"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While $975,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $985,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal.",985000.0,Bob,6,
