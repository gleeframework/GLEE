"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is starting at $1,100,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the game.**  Rejecting the first offer allows you to set the tone for a more favorable deal. 

You'll want to make a counteroffer in the next round to start bringing the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying the product, but it also indicates that you are not willing to accept Alice's initial price.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within your budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially get a good deal.
* **Starts the negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, you are actively participating in the negotiation process and demonstrating your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step down from her initial offer, $1,025,000 is still well above what you're comfortable paying. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already established a range for the price, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  
* **No urgency to settle.** You have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into an agreement that is not in your best interest. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a more favorable price in the following rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:**  This counteroffer shows you're serious about finding a deal but still pushing for a lower price. Increasing your offer by only $25,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining your negotiating position. 
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  The message frames your offer as fair to both parties, creating a sense of compromise and mutual benefit.
* **Leaves space for negotiation:**  You're still below Alice's offer, giving her an opportunity to meet you in the middle. 

By continuing to negotiate and making small adjustments to your counteroffer, you can potentially reach a deal that benefits both you and Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While $975,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While $1,000,000 is closer to your target, you can likely still get a better deal.
* **""Final offer"" is a negotiating tactic.**  Alice is trying to pressure you into accepting her offer.  You shouldn't be rushed, especially since you have multiple rounds remaining.
* **Still room for compromise.** You've already moved from $950,000 to $975,000. A small increase from your last offer might convince Alice to come down further.

By rejecting this offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially secure a lower price in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $985,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 985000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but strategic increase:** This shows you are serious about closing the deal, but you're not willing to cave to Alice's ""final offer"" pressure. A small increase demonstrates your willingness to compromise without conceding too much.
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  The message re-iterates the idea of a fair deal, reinforcing the notion that you're aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Sets the stage for a potential agreement:** By offering a price closer to Alice's, you're increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal in the next round. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between you and Alice and potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
