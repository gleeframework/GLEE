"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to start negotiating to bring the price down.  Buying from John outright would be settling for the maximum price without even trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves ample room to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $14,000 is still above your ideal price and your maximum budget from John. Continuing the negotiation is worthwhile to see if you can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I see the value in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We're increasing our offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate but staying well below her offer to keep working towards a better deal.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" can encourage a collaborative negotiation spirit. 
* **Staying Strategic:** We're still a good margin away from both our ideal price and the backup option, allowing space for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. This product is truly top-notch and I'm confident you'd be very happy with it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your absolute maximum budget, which is also the price John is offering.  There's no strategic advantage to continuing to negotiate at this point, as you're unlikely to get a better price from either seller."
