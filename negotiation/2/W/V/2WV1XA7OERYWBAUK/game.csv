"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This would allow me to move forward, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
