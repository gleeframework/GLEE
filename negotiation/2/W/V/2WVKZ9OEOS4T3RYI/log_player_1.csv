"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. It's important to remember that I have a safety net of $12,000 with John, so I can be fairly aggressive in the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.  It leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. This is a further compromise, showing I'm serious about selling to Bob, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will find this offer more appealing."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and with John as a backup, I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal."
