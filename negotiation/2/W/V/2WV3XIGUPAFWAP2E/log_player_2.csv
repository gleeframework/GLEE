"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm asking for $150 for it.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, it's not worth negotiating.  Buying from John guarantees the product for your limit."
