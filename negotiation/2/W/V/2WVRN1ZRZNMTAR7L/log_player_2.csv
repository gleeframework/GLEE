Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is significantly below the product's true worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on our potential partnership and allows you to acquire a valuable asset without breaking your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
