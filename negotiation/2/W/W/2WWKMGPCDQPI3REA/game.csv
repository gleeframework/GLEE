"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable level?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think the initial price was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I have an alternative option available for considerably less. If you're able to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",700000.0,Bob,4,
