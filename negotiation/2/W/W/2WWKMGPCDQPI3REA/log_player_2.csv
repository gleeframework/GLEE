"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my maximum budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable level?"", ""product_price"": 600000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  Beginning significantly below my maximum budget ($600,000 vs. $800,000) aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired range quickly.
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for counteroffers while still being a substantial jump from Alice's initial offer.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message maintains a polite and professional tone while clearly indicating the starting offer is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the initial price was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a significant improvement, it's still above my maximum budget and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I have an alternative option available for considerably less. If you're able to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** By mentioning the alternative option (John's offer), I'm creating a sense of urgency and suggesting I might walk away.
* **Target Price:** My counteroffer is just below my maximum budget, leaving a small margin for a potential final concession from Alice.
* **Clear Call to Action:**  Offering to ""close the deal today"" at $700,000 emphasizes that this is a strong offer and encourages Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have an alternative option, but I'm confident this product is still the best choice for you. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'll meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her ""final offer"" and indicated she won't go lower.
* **Above Budget:**  Even with her concession, $850,000 is still above my maximum budget and John's offer.
* **No More Room:** It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I risk Alice sticking to her final offer. 

John's offer provides a guaranteed purchase at my target price, making it the most logical choice now."
