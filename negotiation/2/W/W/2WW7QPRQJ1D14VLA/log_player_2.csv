Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at $10,000.  It's clear she's unlikely to go much lower. Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
