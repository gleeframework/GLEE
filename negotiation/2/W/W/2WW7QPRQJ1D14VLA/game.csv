"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
