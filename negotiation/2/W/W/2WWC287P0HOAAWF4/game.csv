"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $600000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm willing to offer $700000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $650000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still hoping to close the deal, but $650000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $675000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $675000, but I'll throw in some additional perks worth $10000 to sweeten the deal. So, the total price would be $675000 + $10000 = $685000. What do you think?",685000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and the added perks. However, $685000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $670000? That would be a good starting point for us to close the deal.",670000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll accept your offer of $670000, but I'll throw in the additional perks worth $10000, just like in my previous offer. So, the total price would be $670000 + $10000 = $680000. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to offer $675000, but I'm not able to include the additional perks at this time. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",675000.0,Bob,8,
