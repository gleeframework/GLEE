"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I propose a starting price of $950,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you as well.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $900,000 for the product. This still leaves a significant profit margin for me while acknowledging your valuation.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to adjust my offer slightly. I am now proposing $875,000 for the product.
