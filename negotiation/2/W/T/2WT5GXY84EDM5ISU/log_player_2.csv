"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable item at a competitive price. Given its worth to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price of $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly aware you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and is aiming for a price that heavily favors her. 
* While $12,000 is a ""discount,"" you can likely get a better deal by negotiating or considering John's offer.
* Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price, closer to her $8,000 minimum. 
* Even if you end up buying from John, you'll only lose $3,000 compared to Alice's current offer."
