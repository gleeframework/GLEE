"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more realistic price point.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies this price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price.  While his offer increased, it's not a significant jump. We need to signal that the product is worth considerably more while remaining in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value of this product.  To be frank, $700,000 is still significantly under its worth.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain from this purchase."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop, firm stance:** We're making a substantial drop in price from $1,900,000 to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility but also signals this is a serious offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping he sees this price as a fair compromise.
* **Time pressure:**  With each round, we get closer to potentially selling to John. This offer aims to push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I have to be honest,  $1,600,000 is simply not feasible for me. My absolute limit is $750,000.  If you can't meet that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has barely increased his offer. His latest counteroffer shows he is either unwilling or unable to meet a price that's even remotely close to our valuation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  Each round spent on Bob is a round further away from our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a firm offer from John at our desired price. There's no reason to risk this by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
