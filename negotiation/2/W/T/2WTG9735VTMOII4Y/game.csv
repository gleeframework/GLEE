"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more realistic price point.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies this price.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value of this product.  To be frank, $700,000 is still significantly under its worth.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain from this purchase.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I have to be honest,  $1,600,000 is simply not feasible for me. My absolute limit is $750,000.  If you can't meet that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
