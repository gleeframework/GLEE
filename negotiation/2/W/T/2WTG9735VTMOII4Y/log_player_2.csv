"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and the product's worth to you. It's highly unlikely she'll agree to a price within your range if you accept this offer. It's better to negotiate and see if you can bring the price down substantially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more realistic price point.  Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than our budget, we leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **Direct & Realistic:** The message is clear that the initial price is unacceptable and proposes a more reasonable starting point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us a better understanding of Alice's flexibility and help us tailor our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your budget and what you're willing to pay. It's clear she's not willing to drop to your desired range quickly.  Continuing negotiations might waste valuable time. It's worth seeing if she'll move closer to a reasonable amount in the next round, but be prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** Increasing the offer, even by a small amount, demonstrates to Alice that you're willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message firmly states your limit ($700,000) while still maintaining a respectful and professional tone. 
* **Strategic Pressure:** By presenting this as your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to seriously consider a significant price reduction if she wants to close the deal with you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value of this product.  To be frank, $700,000 is still significantly under its worth.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value you'll gain from this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has decreased her offer, but it is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and her ""firm"" stance doesn't leave much room for negotiation.  Continuing the negotiation might result in wasting time and potentially missing out on securing the product from John at a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I have to be honest,  $1,600,000 is simply not feasible for me. My absolute limit is $750,000.  If you can't meet that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is a last-ditch effort to see if Alice will drastically reduce her price. By stating your absolute limit and hinting at other options, you're emphasizing the urgency of the situation.
* **Slight Increase, Clear Limit:**  The slight increase from $700,000 to $750,000 shows a willingness to compromise but makes it clear that this is your final offer.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** By this point, it's becoming clear that Alice might not agree to a price within your range.  Be prepared to walk away and buy from John if she rejects this offer."
