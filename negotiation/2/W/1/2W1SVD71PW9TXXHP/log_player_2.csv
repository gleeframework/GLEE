"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than her initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You have the option of going to John if the negotiation with Alice fails, so you're not taking a huge risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's $13,000 offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** The message explains the counteroffer, highlighting the budget constraint and acknowledging Alice's valuation.
* **Room for compromise:**  $11,000 still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate if she's willing to come down a bit more.  

I'm playing the role of Bob here, trying to get the best price!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I'm confident this price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, moving closer to your desired price point. 
* **Within Budget:**  While $12,000 is above your ideal price, it's still within your budget of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If you reject the offer, there's a risk Alice will hold firm at $12,000 or even raise her price again. 

Considering the potential for a further stalemate and the fact that John's offer is a guaranteed $10,000, accepting Alice's offer at $12,000 represents a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
