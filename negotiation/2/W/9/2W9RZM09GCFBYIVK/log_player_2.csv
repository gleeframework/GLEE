Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here is my counteroffer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.
