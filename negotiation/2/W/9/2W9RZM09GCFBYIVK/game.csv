"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd like to meet you in the middle, but at $10,500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $10,500 is still too low for me. This is my final offer: $11,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a reasonable profit, but I'm really not willing to go above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but that's as high as I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
