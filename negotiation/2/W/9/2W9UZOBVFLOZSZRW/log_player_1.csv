Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I am unable to meet the price of $850,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $790,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 right away. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to accept $790,000 at this time.  The product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident in its value. How about we split the difference and go with $820,000? This price would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to counter with an offer of $805,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $805,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is only $5,000 below my minimum acceptable price. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from Bob, and selling to John would net me less.  I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the deal."
