"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far too high.  Since you are only willing to pay up to $800,000, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,150,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. To be fair to both of us,  how about we settle on $950,000? This is a good middle ground and allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  I'm confident that John will sell me the product at my desired price. It's better to avoid further negotiation and secure the product from John."
