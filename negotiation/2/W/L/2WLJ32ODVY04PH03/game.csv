"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. To be fair to both of us,  how about we settle on $950,000? This is a good middle ground and allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
