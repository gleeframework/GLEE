"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,350,000.  This is a one-time opportunity for you to own a truly unique asset.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This would give you a great deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for this exceptional product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
