Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still make more money.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,350,000.  This is a one-time opportunity for you to own a truly unique asset."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This would give you a great deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for this exceptional product."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good deal and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk a lower price or have to sell to John."
