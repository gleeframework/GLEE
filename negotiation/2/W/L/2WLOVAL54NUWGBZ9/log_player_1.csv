{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm offering it to you for $9,500, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, which gives me a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $10,000 floor. I'm not desperate to sell, so I won't accept a deal that undervalues the product.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I can likely get a higher price from Bob.  There's still room for negotiation and a middle ground to be found.
* **John as Safety Net:** John's $10,000 offer is a safety net, giving me the flexibility to reject Bob's offer without losing out on a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $8,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $9,200.  This price is fair considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can make this work! "", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price but still maintaining a profit.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Clear Offer:** I'm making a clear counteroffer and expressing a desire to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer $9,200, continuing to negotiate may lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out entirely. 
* **Time is Money:**  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is higher, it's not guaranteed, and taking too long to reach an agreement with Bob could risk John finding another product.  

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and financially sound choice."
