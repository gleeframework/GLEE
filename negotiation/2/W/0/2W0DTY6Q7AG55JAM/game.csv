"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $12,500 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss the terms further?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something closer to $11,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500, which is $11,750. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,500, which is $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,7,
