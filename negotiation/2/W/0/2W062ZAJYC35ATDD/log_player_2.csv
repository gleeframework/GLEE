"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $100. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's value of $100 but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and shows he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob still sees room for improvement.  He's determined to get the best possible price, so rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation moving towards his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's willing to pay a bit more than his previous offer, but still keeping it below $110. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price.  By increasing his offer slightly, he's hoping to encourage Alice to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $107. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's within his budget and much closer to his desired price. Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continuing negotiations. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  The current offer is the best deal he's received so far."
