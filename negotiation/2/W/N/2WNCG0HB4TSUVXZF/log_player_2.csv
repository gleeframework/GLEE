{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,000,000.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.** You might be able to get Alice to lower her price further.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** You can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice doesn't work out."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's likely she won't go lower than $1,200,000. 
* **Buying from John is the best option now.** You have a guaranteed way to get the product for your maximum price. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** The longer you negotiate, the more likely it is that Alice will become unwilling to sell at a lower price, or that you might miss out on the product if another buyer appears."
