``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting her offer and buying from John at the same price is the best option. You're not losing any money, but you're maintaining your flexibility in case a better deal comes along."
