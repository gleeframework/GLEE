"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to walk away with if I don't find a better offer. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm ready to pay $16000.  This is a fair price, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to sell it to you at $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,5,
