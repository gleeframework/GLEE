Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a good midpoint between your minimum desired price and Bob's estimated value. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While selling to John is an option, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower and I'm not willing to continue negotiating at this point.  It's now in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product to him.  I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is still a substantial profit for me."
