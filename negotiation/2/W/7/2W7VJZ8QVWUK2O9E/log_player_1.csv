Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), so he's getting a good deal if he accepts.

It's unlikely Bob will accept a price above $110, as it gets closer to your guaranteed selling price to John."
