Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet halfway and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob has been persistent in offering $8,000, and I'm not willing to drop that low.  It's clear we won't reach a compromise, and I have a guaranteed sale with John."
