Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies significant value and encourages Bob to engage in a conversation where you can potentially justify the price further.
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into his perception of the product's value and his willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might outright reject this initial offer, which is fine. You can then counter with a lower price, gradually moving closer to $800,000 if needed."
