"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to offer $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $7,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'd still make a profit.",8250.0,Bob,4,
