"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, considering its worth to you is $120. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have the option to buy from John for $120. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
