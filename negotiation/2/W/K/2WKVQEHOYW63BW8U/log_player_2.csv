"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $60. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good price.  It's also a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $65, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer was $60.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer.  There's a good chance I could negotiate a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $100 is not worth the potential $5 savings."
