Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, aiming slightly lower than that with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer with a sense of urgency and exclusivity can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a price higher than his initial valuation.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
