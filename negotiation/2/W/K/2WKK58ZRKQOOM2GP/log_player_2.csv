"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no point in accepting it.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This gives Alice a clear idea of my price range and hopefully starts the negotiation process. It's a bold move, but it's also a good starting point. If Alice rejects, we can continue to negotiate down from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,750,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, especially since I've already shown I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,500,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still sticking to my budget.  It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
