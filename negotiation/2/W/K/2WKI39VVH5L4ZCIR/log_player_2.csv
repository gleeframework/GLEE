It's always worth exploring other options before committing to a price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a big discount from her initial offer, but it's a starting point for negotiation."

Alice is still asking for a price that is too high. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above what I think is fair.  I'll try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still significantly below her offer.  This is a good compromise point and hopefully will lead to an agreement."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance she won't budge further.  Accepting her offer of $350,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000."
