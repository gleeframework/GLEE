"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice since the product is worth $100 to you and only $80 to her.  You can likely get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

You can still get a better deal than $90. Reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."
