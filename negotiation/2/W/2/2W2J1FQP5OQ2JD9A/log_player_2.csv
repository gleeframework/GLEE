"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. It's a great deal considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $15,000 is much higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John at a significantly lower price."
