"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get by buying the product, making the price more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for back-and-forth without immediately reaching a stalemate. 
* **First Round Strategy:** It's important to gauge Bob's interest and see how much negotiating room he has."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but there's a chance I could get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my bottom line.
* **Maintaining Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the premium he's getting.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $950,000 is a good midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a more likely point of agreement.
* **Keeping the Deal Alive:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:** While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the best option.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I can counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility while maintaining my desired outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5, aiming to get closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $937,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get and the progress we've made in negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I continue to remind Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $937,500 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Building Momentum:**  This counteroffer helps keep negotiations moving forward and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm not at a point where I have to settle for this offer. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, potentially getting close to my initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 7, aiming to get closer to $1,000,000.  I'll likely try to meet him halfway between our current offers, making it a very attractive deal for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $928,750.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 928750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $937,500 and Bob's latest offer of $920,000. This shows I'm genuinely willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value Bob will gain from acquiring the product.  
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer significantly narrows the price difference, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to get closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly better outcome in the limited time remaining.

**Decision:**

Selling to John at $1,200,000 is the most sensible decision. While it might be possible to squeeze a slightly higher price out of Bob, the risk of no deal and the guaranteed profit with John makes this the best choice."
