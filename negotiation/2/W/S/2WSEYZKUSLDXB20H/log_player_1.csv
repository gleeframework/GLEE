"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your absolute bottom line. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how he values the product. His response will guide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 for it to make sense for me. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is his perceived value, it's a non-starter for me as it's less than my minimum.  I need to see if I can negotiate him up while also considering John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're offering is unfortunately too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Not Really):**  While I phrase it as ""meeting halfway,"" this offer is strategically closer to my starting price than Bob's. It keeps the negotiation moving but signals I'm willing to compromise... to a point.
* **Time Pressure:** As we progress through the rounds, I need to keep John's offer in mind. I'll become more flexible in later rounds if needed to avoid reaching a point where selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to my minimum, but I'm not there yet. I'm willing to play out another round or two to see if I can get him closer to $12,000. The risk of losing the deal by continuing to negotiate is becoming more real, but I believe there's still some room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $12,500?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm dropping my price significantly to show I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still aiming for a bit above my minimum to leave some room in case Bob pushes back.
* **Time Pressure:** Half the rounds are gone. This price is a strong signal that I need Bob to get closer to my range soon.
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, the firm offer in my back pocket gives me confidence in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about finding a fair deal. I'm willing to stretch to $11,500. That's really the best I can do. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** While Bob is inching closer, he's still $500 away from my minimum.  There's a real chance he won't budge further, and I'll be forced to accept a lower price or lose the deal altogether in later rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to take the sure thing.
* **Time Value:** Every round represents a potential delay, and time is money in business. Accepting John's offer brings a quicker resolution. 

While there was a chance of squeezing a bit more profit out of Bob, the risk of ending up with less than $12,000 is too high at this point."
