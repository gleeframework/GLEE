"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1200000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer, it's still below what I need to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1275000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident we can both benefit from this transaction.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1275000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
