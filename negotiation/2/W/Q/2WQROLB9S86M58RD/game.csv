"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $975,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
