"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating that it's beyond my budget.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** I'm aiming for a price that's a good deal below Alice's valuation but still leaves room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $975,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While Alice met me halfway, $975,000 is still significantly higher than my initial offer. There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **John is an Option:** I have the backup option of buying from John at $1,500,000. This gives me some leverage, as I'm not desperate to accept Alice's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm gradually increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price below $975,000.
* **Justification:** By suggesting $900,000 is fair for both parties, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I'm trying to get a reasonable deal, not lowball her.
* **Time Consideration:** I'm aware that each round of negotiation takes time, and I need to decide if securing a lower price is worth potentially losing the deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. While I could push for a slightly lower amount, $925,000 is a reasonable compromise and a significant savings compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away entirely. Accepting now secures the product at a good price.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now avoids further delays and allows me to start benefiting from the product sooner."
