Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $762,500

While Bob is attempting to negotiate a fair price, his latest offer is still below John's standing offer.  It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer to get closer to the $800,000 mark.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to accept John's offer and secure the guaranteed $800,000."
