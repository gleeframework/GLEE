"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good discount from her perceived value, you can still do better. You have a safety net with John's offer for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially secure the product at a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This still represents a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while keeping the price within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a reasonable return on my investment. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still higher than you're aiming for. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, you can continue negotiating with Alice and try to push her lower. There's still room for compromise, and you might be able to secure the product for less than $1,300,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is only $50,000 more than your last counteroffer of $1,250,000.  While you might be able to continue negotiating, at this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer.  You are still getting a good price for the product, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely or ending up paying John's price of $1,000,000."
