{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate. I'll see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000.  This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
