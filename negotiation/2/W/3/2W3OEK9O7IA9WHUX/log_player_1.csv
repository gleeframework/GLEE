Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $80.  I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $120? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95. If that's not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. This gives us both a fair deal. If we can't come to an agreement, I may need to consider John's offer."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $107.50 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $98.75? This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.75
