"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a significantly lower price of $1,000,000."
