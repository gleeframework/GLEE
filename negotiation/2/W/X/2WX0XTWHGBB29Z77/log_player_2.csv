Alice's offer:

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and it still leaves some room for negotiation on your side.

While Alice's offer is closer to what Bob is willing to pay, it's still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a lower price."

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a while now. While Alice has been willing to negotiate, the price has not dropped to a level where it is worth it for Bob to buy from her. At this point, Bob should go with John's offer and save himself $170,000."
