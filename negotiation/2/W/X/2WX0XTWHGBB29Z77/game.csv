"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and it still leaves some room for negotiation on your side.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and offers a good compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll meet you at $980,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, and it's still a significant profit for me considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. $980,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. Let's try to bridge the gap with a final offer of $960,000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I don't leave too much on the table. I'll meet you at $970,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us, and it's the best I can do without selling to John for $1,000,000.",970000.0,Alice,7,
