"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while still acknowledging your perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  That's a significant offer and reflects my strong interest in the product."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, selling this for anything less than $950,000 would not be in my best interest. That said, I value your time and believe this product would be very beneficial for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price significantly higher than your maximum budget. While her latest offer is a concession, it's still $150,000 more than John's offer. At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  Cutting your losses and securing the product from John for $800,000 is the most financially sound decision."
