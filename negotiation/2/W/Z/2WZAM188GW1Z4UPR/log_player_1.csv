Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
