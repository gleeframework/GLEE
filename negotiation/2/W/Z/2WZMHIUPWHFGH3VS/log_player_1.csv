I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000.  This gives me a decent margin above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also a price that might be appealing to Bob, as it's not too far above my minimum price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
