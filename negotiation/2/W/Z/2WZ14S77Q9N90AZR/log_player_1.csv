"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I believe Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $800,000 is simply not acceptable. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, which is still significantly more than what Bob offered, but also acknowledges the need for compromise. This should encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet, and I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm still confident I can reach a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing that I'm committed to reaching a deal with Bob. This counteroffer is a strong signal that I'm serious about negotiating, but still leaves room for a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get more. I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round and see if I can push Bob to come closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still hopeful that Bob will meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I might start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob and I are not close enough in price. We are both stuck in our positions. While I'd like to get a better price, the risk of further negotiations failing is high. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a good deal and meets my minimum price.  It's time to take the secure option."
