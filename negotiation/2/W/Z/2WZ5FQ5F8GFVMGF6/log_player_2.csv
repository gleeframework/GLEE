``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay $10,000, and there's no reason to pay more right now. You can try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but unfortunately, I can't go above $10,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $10500? It's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you're willing to pay $10,000, Alice is now offering the product for $10,500. This is still a better deal than buying from John for $10,000, and you're saving $500."
