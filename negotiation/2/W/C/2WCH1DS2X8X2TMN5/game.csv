"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? That's still a good price for you and leaves me some room to make a profit.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'll consider $115 but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $100. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  However, $105 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to go up to $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
