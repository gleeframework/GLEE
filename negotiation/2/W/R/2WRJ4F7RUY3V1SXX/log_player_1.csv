Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point, as it is more than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation and hopefully secures a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $110 is still a good deal for Bob, and there's room for me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is a compromise, still giving Bob a good deal while getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk him walking away or lowering his offer further."
