"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I must stick to my budget. Could we aim for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price slightly above your offer. How about we meet at $850000? This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
