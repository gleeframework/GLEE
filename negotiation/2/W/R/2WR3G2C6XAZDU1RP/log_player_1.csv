Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:**  It shows Bob that you're open to finding a price that works for both of you.
* **It sets the stage for a potential counteroffer:**  Bob may be willing to pay closer to your minimum, but he may also be encouraged to counteroffer with a price closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer,  keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
