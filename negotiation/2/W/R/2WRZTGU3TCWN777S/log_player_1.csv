Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a significant profit. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $135, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a profit. This is a good compromise, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $132 is a good compromise. Accepting this ensures a decent profit and avoids risking further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even selling to John for less."
