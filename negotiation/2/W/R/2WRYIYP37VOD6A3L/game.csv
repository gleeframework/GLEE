"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $200 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To better accommodate your needs while still valuing our product, I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. This price reflects the value I believe it holds for you, while remaining within your budget. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  This is my absolute limit, so let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to meet you halfway at $125. This price reflects the cost of production and distribution, while also allowing you to acquire a high-quality product at a reasonable price. I hope this proposal aligns more closely with your budget and we can finalize the transaction.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not there yet.  $125 is still over my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $112.50.  This is a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,6,
