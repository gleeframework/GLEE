"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great fit for your needs.  My initial offer is $1,450,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and also allows for room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this is a good starting point.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, reflecting the value I see in this product and its potential for your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
