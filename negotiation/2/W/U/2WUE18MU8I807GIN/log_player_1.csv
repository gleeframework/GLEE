Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal for something you'll value highly."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 allows you to capture the most value possible from Bob. He's getting a $1 discount from his perceived value, making it attractive, while you secure almost the maximum profit. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have the security of John's offer ($100) if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
