"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my means.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
