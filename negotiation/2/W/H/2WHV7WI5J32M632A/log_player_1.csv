``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 but still above my minimum of $800,000.

* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant value"" to remind Bob of the product's worth.

* Get the negotiation started smoothly.
* Set a high starting point but leave room for negotiation.
* Encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.** While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **I have more negotiation room.**  I can afford to reject this offer and try to get a better price.
* **John is a fallback option.**  I'm aware that John is willing to buy for $800,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping my options open. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price to make this deal work for me.

This price still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value, and it also allows me to achieve my desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm using a counteroffer to bridge the gap between our positions. My offer of $925,000 is halfway between my previous price of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $880,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $890,000 is very close to my minimum, I am still hoping to secure a slightly higher price.
