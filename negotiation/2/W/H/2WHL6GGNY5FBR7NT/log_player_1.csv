Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. I understand it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum of $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to see if I can push him a bit further. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $10,800? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiation. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's also a good compromise given the back-and-forth negotiations.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that may not result in a better outcome.  It's also important to consider the time value of money and the potential for future sales.  By accepting this offer, I can secure a sale and move on to other opportunities."
