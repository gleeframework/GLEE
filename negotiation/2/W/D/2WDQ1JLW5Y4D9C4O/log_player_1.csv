Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm happy to buy it for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that's still within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
