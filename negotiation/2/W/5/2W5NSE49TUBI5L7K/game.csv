"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm offering $925,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the value you've placed on it.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need for profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $950,000 just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $980,000. It's a small increase, but it's closer to my minimum price and takes into account the value you've placed on the product.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $960,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $960,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. It's a small increase, but it's still below the maximum value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",990000.0,Alice,9,
