"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. I could meet you halfway at $7,250. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
