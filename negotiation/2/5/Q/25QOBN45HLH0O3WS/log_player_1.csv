Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **It's better than John's offer:**  $120 is significantly more than the $80 you'd get from John, so it's worth trying to get that price.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $120 is still $30 less than the product is worth to him, meaning he gets a good deal and is likely to accept.

Let me know if you want to try a different offer, or if you'd like to strategize further!"
