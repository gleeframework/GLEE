Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's still early in the negotiation. Accepting $90 is better than nothing, but let's see if we can get closer to $100."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $120 is my initial offer, I could be persuaded to come down to $110. I believe the product's quality justifies this price."", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob seems pretty set on a price below my minimum. It's not worth wasting more time negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John."
