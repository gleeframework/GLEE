"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value of the product, and $650,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you finding some middle ground, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $725,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not convinced it's enough. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, Alice, we need a price that works for both of us. $825,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to settle at $775,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Let's try $825,000 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway this time at $812,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",812500.0,Alice,7,
