{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than Alice's initial price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget of $12,000 as possible.  Offering $12,500 is a good starting point for negotiation.  This offer is a reasonable compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Even though it's slightly better than the previous offer, it's not worth it for Bob to accept. He should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get closer to his maximum budget of $12,000 while still being reasonable. Offering $13,000 shows a willingness to compromise while also demonstrating that Bob is serious about acquiring the product."
