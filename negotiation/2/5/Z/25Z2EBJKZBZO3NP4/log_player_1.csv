Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so this gives him room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price that's not your full asking price, you show flexibility.

This approach allows for potential counter-offers from Bob and gives you a good chance of securing a price that's closer to the product's true value for you."
