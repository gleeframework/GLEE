Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation. This price is closer to Bob's perceived value than mine, but still gives me significant profit.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy and how he values the product. His response will dictate my next move.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 gives me leverage. I won't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still significantly higher than my minimum. This suggests he's very interested and open to negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how firm he is on his ""highest I can go"" statement. It's possible he's using a common negotiation tactic. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm not in a rush. Having John's offer means I can confidently push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Step:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit margin. It's a common tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true value"" reinforces that my price isn't arbitrary and subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to his price, I'm not conceding too much too quickly. I want to see if he's willing to move further towards my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could likely negotiate a slightly higher price, the potential gain is getting smaller with each round. It's not worth risking the deal entirely.
* **""Absolute Maximum"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests this is likely his final offer. Pushing further risks him walking away.

**Conclusion:** Accepting $1,150,000 is a smart move. It secures a great profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or losing the sale to Bob."
