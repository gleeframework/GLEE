"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from your initial offer. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, however, my initial price is based on the unique advantages it offers. I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,150,000.  This reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the slight concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize the value of reaching an agreement.  My final offer is $1,075,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
