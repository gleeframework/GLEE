Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" framing might make it more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and there's a chance to settle somewhere between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000.

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
