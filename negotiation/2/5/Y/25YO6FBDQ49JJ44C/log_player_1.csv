Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived $10,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?""  signals to Bob that Alice is open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating. 

By starting at $14,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts immediately, Alice knows she could have potentially gone even higher.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, Alice can gradually lower the price, ultimately aiming for a price above her $10,000 minimum.
3. **Maintain a strong position:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can confidently fall back on her deal with John."
