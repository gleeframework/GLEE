"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to Bob.  I'm hoping to get as close to my value as possible while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm hoping to get closer to $110 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also recognizing that I need to be flexible to close a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get closer to $100 in the next round. I'm hoping that Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95 in this round. I'm dropping my price slightly to encourage Bob to accept. This price is closer to Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also considering the time pressure of the negotiation and hoping to close the deal before I need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's latest offer is at his personal value, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get him to go higher. There's no guarantee that a counteroffer will be accepted in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale with John."
