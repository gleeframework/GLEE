"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10000. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $18000 is still above my budget. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my initial offer of $10000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I can go, considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
