"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to reach a compromise here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,
