"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a great product, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let's make this deal happen.",120.0,Alice,5,
