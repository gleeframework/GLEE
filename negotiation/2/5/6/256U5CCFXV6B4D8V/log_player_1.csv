{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It signals you're confident in the product's value but also open to discussion.

If Bob rejects, you can then consider his counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price. Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely do better.  You're still in a good position to negotiate further with Bob. Rejecting his offer will allow you to counter with a price that's closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's a reasonable step down from your initial offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above Bob's counteroffer:** You're leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **It's a strong position to be in:**  You're still making a good profit while remaining open to Bob's potential acceptance.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to move a little higher. How about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still not quite there.  You're still in a good position to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  Let's see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

This counteroffer is strategically placed:

* **It's a small step down from your previous offer:**  Shows you're still flexible.
* **It's above Bob's offer:**  Leaves room for a final deal if he's willing to budge.
* **It's closer to a compromise:**  Signals that you're serious about reaching an agreement.

Let's see if this is the offer Bob accepts!"
