"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $110. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to give myself room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and make Bob want to buy it. 
* **Leaving the door open:** My message is open-ended, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he wants. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is significantly below my minimum price of $100, and even below what Bob himself believes the product is worth ($80). 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $70. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Selling to Bob for $70 would be a bad deal for me. It's better to keep negotiating or sell to John for a guaranteed $100. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($70). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth $80 to him, implying that $90 is still a good deal.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm not going below $90 at this point, but I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $82 is just $2 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Potential for future negotiation:** While it's not ideal, accepting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation open for potential future sales. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll eventually have to settle for a lower price. 

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'll be sure to keep in mind that I could potentially get a better price in the future."
