,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $157.50?  I think that's a fair compromise.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $157.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $150, which is the price I could get it from another seller. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy it now.",150.0,Bob,4,
