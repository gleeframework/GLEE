Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us, aiming to build a positive rapport.
* **Keeping the option open:** This price leaves room for me to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is a powerful bargaining chip. If the negotiation with Bob stalls or falls apart, I have a guaranteed alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have a strong bargaining position because John is willing to pay a much higher price. 
* **Counter-offer potential:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially finding a middle ground that's more acceptable to both of us. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation alive and have the opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $950,000 represents a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" and ""mutual benefit"" of the proposed price, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Still above minimum:** $950,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary. 
* **John as leverage:** I continue to use John's offer as a backstop, knowing that I can always walk away and sell the product for a higher price. 

By making a counteroffer, I'm actively engaging in the negotiation, showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and potentially lead to further concessions. 
* **John's guaranteed offer:**  Selling to John provides me with the highest possible profit and eliminates any risk associated with further negotiations with Bob. 

Given the circumstances, selling to John represents the most financially advantageous decision."
