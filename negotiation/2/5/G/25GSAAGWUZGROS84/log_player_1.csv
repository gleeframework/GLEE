Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80), but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone and suggesting a benefit for Bob to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've made a profit of $30.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll consider Bob's counteroffer and weigh it against John's offer of $150. If Bob's counteroffer is acceptable, I'll accept it. If not, I'll either make a counteroffer or move on to John to ensure I don't lose out on the $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $100 is still significantly below my minimum price of $150. It's not worth accepting such a low offer.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I can potentially get a better price by counteroffering or by selling to John. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $150 is a guaranteed profit, and I don't want to risk losing that by accepting a lower offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $120? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and hopefully, it's a fair price for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this price still allows me to make a profit, implying that it's a fair deal for both of us.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a profit of $20. 
* **Bob Rejects:** If Bob rejects again, I'll have to weigh his counteroffer against John's offer of $150 and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than $120, I was thinking more around $110. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  John is offering me $150, which is my minimum price and ensures I don't lose money. 
* **Negotiation is Stalling:**  Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum, but we're still far apart. Continuing to negotiate risks further delays and might not lead to a better offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his low offers and the potential for further back-and-forth are not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $150 from John."
