"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,050,000.  It's worth at least that much to me, and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable.  If you're interested, let's discuss the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She knows you have an alternative buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000.  By mentioning another buyer, she's trying to pressure you into accepting a higher price.  You should reject her initial offer and see if she'll come down."
