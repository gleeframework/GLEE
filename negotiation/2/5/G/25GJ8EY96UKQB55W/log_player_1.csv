Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point.  Since I don't know anything about Bob's willingness to pay, I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll need to observe Bob's reaction to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum, and while I'd rather sell to Bob than John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm  countering with $17,000. This is a compromise, still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is above my minimum of $15,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's better to accept this offer than to risk losing the deal altogether or selling to John for a lower price."
