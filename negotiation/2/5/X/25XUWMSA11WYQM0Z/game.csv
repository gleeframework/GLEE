"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some wiggle room for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your final offer, but $1,350,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,425,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budget. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
