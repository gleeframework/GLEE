``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but gives him room to negotiate.  I'm also leaving room for myself to go lower if necessary.  Since I have another buyer, I can always walk away and still get my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a bit lower than what you're asking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not going to give away my product for such a significant loss.  I will counter with a higher price, hoping to find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  That gives you a great deal and still allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my final offer. I really need to keep costs down on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  $750,000 is still significantly less than my minimum.  I need to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get a little concerned that I might need to walk away and buy from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $795,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below it.  I've reached my limit for negotiation.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a price that is too low, I'll sell to John. He's guaranteed to pay my minimum, ensuring I get the best possible outcome."
