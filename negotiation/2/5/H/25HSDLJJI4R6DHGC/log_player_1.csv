"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a starting point to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get close to my target price of $12,000, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate with him. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $12,000 because I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, as this is a fair price for both of us. If he rejects again, I'll be ready to sell to John."
