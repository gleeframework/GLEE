"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we aim for $125? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while remaining competitive. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
