"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us and leaves room for us to come to an agreement.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,110,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,115,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",1115000.0,Alice,5,
