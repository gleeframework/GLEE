"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum price, but I can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us and leaves room for us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,110,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,115,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,115,000, which is only $5,000 more than my last counteroffer. At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, and I might end up having to buy from John for $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price that's still within my budget and saves me from the higher price of John's offer."
