"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to demonstrate his intention to negotiate aggressively. He's aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than $1,200,000, Bob can still try to push for a lower price. Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Continuing to reject the offer and counter-offer gives Bob the potential to secure a price closer to his target without risking buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's perceived value for the product. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise, but still leaves room for a slight negotiation if Alice is motivated to close the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good deal for Bob. It's closer to Alice's perceived value and significantly less than John's price.  While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal dragging on is too high. Accepting the offer secures the product for a price well within his budget and saves time and potential frustration."
