"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product for a better price from John, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
