"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This gives Bob a good deal, but still leaves me with a profit that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'll see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my target of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

I'm going to counter with $9,750. It's a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to close the deal."

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still keeps the price above Bob's last offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I think this might be enough to convince Bob to accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value of $8,000. I'm not willing to risk ending up with less than $9,000. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's a sure thing and a much better outcome than risking a lower price with Bob."
