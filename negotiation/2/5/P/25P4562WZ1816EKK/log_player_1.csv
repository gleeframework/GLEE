Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy**

The key is to leave Bob with a potential profit that's enticing enough to accept your offer.  Offering a price slightly below his perceived value maximizes your profit while ensuring he's likely to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Profit Maximization:**  This price nets you $150,000 above your minimum.
* **Appealing to Bob:** Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him, making it a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially earn even more. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial situation beyond the provided values."
