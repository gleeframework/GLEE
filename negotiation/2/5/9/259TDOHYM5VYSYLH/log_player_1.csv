"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have John as a backup option, and there are still several rounds left to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to offer $100, which is my minimum price. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's also a price I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of my willingness to compromise and accept the deal."
