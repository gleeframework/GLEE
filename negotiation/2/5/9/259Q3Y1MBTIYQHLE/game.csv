"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, however.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
