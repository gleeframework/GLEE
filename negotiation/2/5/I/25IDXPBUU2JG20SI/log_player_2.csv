"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's:** $1,075,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Alice has already lowered her price from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000, and her message implies she's not willing to go much lower.  
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but it could also lead to Alice becoming less interested in selling to you, or you might lose out on the opportunity if someone else buys the product.

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,075,000 secures the product at a decent price and minimizes the risk of losing it to another buyer or wasting time with further negotiation."
