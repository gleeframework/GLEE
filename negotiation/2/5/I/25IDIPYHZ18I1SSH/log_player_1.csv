"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value. This establishes a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($1,500,000) as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value and even lower than his own perceived value of the product.  I need to continue negotiating to get a better price. Selling to John guarantees me a higher price, but I'm hoping to get closer to my own valuation through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping to signal my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a substantial profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still well below my minimum value and even below his own perceived value of the product. I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with such a low profit margin. I'm hopeful that by continuing negotiations, I can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my counteroffer, but it's still higher than Bob's latest offer and closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to increase his offer in the next round. I'm also taking into account that I have limited rounds left, so I need to find a balance between getting a good price and avoiding losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my desired price and only slightly higher than his last offer. While time is running out, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price.  By rejecting his offer, I'm keeping the door open for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to make concessions, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, but with only a few rounds left, I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether. I'm hoping that this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to come up to a more acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While a slightly higher offer could be possible, the risk of failing to reach a deal is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of losing the deal. It's a pragmatic decision given the limited time and the need to secure a profitable outcome."
