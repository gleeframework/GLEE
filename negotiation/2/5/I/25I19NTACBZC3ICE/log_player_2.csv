# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is far above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's crucial to start negotiating to bring the price down. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it reflects the very minimum I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and we're already in round 5.  To avoid risking further negotiation rounds, I'll accept John's offer of $800,000, which is within my budget."
