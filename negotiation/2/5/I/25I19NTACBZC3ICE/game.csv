"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate value for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering both our needs.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
