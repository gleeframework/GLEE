Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's lower than what the product is worth to you, leaving room for negotiation. However, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.  This strategy aims to secure a price that's closer to your desired value without immediately scaring Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a loss from my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my minimum desired value before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
