"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the high price by highlighting the product's ""value and potential,""  creating an aura of desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""starting price,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Serious:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 indicates he's a serious buyer, exceeding his initial perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between his offer and my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the product's unique nature and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and reiterating my willingness to negotiate, building rapport.
* **Holding Firm (For Now):**  While moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still significantly above his initial valuation.  I want to test his flexibility and see if he's willing to move substantially.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits to justify the higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer puts me in a strong position. If Bob accepts, I've exceeded his perceived value. If he rejects and counters, I'll have a better understanding of his true limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Bob's willingness to move above his perceived value indicates strong interest, but he's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties associated with further negotiation rounds.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
