Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm still trying to get closer to my desired price point. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a slightly better offer. I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $115. This is a fair price that respects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has been consistent with his offer of $110. We've been going back and forth, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  $110 is a good price, considering my minimum is $100 and I have John as a backup if this doesn't work out."
