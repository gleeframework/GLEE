Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John at $100, which provides a safety net and influences my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his perceived value ($120). By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about negotiating within a more reasonable range.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $90, especially knowing Bob values the product at a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $105, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($90) and my initial asking price ($115). This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations forward.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  Importantly, this counteroffer still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. This approach keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is still below my ideal price, it's higher than John's standing offer of $100. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or further lowballing the price. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential of a worse outcome."
