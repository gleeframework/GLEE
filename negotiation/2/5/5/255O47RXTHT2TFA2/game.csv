"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about buying.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, but I need at least $1,250,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
