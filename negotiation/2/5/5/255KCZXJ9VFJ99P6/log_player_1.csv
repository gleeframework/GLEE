"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering me for your product. I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can offer you a higher price of $160 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $160 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time Sensitivity:** We're only on round 2, and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John by being too picky.
* **Profit Potential:** While $160 is less than my initial asking price, it's still a good profit margin."
