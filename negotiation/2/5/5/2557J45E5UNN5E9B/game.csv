"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This still leaves room for a healthy profit for you, and it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $890000?  This is a significant drop from my last offer and represents a solid deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal before we both miss out on a great opportunity.",890000.0,Alice,5,
