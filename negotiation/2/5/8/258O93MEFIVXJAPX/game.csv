"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. My final offer is $1,400,000. This would allow you to recover a significant portion of the product's value and would be a fair price for me. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
