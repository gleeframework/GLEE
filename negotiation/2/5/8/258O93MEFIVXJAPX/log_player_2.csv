"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes no sense to accept it. You should reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial $2,000,000 offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again."
