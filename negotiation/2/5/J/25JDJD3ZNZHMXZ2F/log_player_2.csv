"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. You can potentially save money by making a counteroffer.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, you have a benchmark to work with.  You want to aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and it's closer to your target price.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
