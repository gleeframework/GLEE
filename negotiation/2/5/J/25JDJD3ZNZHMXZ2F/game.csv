"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000.
