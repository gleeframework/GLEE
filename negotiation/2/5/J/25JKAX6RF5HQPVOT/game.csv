"Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product, but $1,800,000 is still too far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest. I believe this price fairly reflects the value we both see in this product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
