"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear you're getting closer to your budget. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
