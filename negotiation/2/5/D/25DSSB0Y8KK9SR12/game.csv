"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $110 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $100. Can you do that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to meet you at $100, but I can do $105. That's the lowest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $102.50. Can you consider that?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. That's the best I can do. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $107.50, and now you're asking me to go back to $105? I'm not comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you at $106, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",106.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really not willing to pay $106. I've already offered $105, and I think that's a fair price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.",105.0,Bob,10,
