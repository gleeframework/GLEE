"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 

This strategy is designed to get the negotiation started and see if Bob is genuinely interested. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and my remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1200000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to close the deal. I have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance I can get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Explore Options:** See if I can push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can get a better sense of how badly he wants the product. If he counteroffers again, it shows stronger commitment.
* **Preserve Leverage:**  Accepting immediately gives Bob all the leverage. By rejecting, I keep the pressure on him. 

I'm confident that I can find a better price within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's keep talking, I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again stressing the true value of the product. This reinforces that $1,400,000 is a fair price, not a random number.
* **Maintaining Optimism:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the possibility of reaching an agreement. This encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer strikes a balance between pushing for a good price and maintaining a positive negotiation atmosphere. We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not ready to accept. Here's why:

* **Time is on my side:**  I have six rounds remaining.  There's still a chance I can get a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting too early gives Bob the advantage. By rejecting, I keep him engaged and encourage further counteroffers.
* **Seeking a ""Win-Win"":**  While $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price that's more equitable and reflects the product's value.

I'll counteroffer again with a price that bridges the gap, hopefully getting us closer to a mutually acceptable solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is a reasonable compromise, and I truly believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I'm reiterating that this price is fair for both of us, creating a sense of mutual benefit. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""walk away satisfied"" to subtly imply that time is running out and a deal is within reach.

This counteroffer aims to tempt Bob closer to my desired price while still showing a willingness to compromise."
