Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your consideration, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $12,500. This price ensures a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
