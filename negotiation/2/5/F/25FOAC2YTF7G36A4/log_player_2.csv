Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, given the production costs and my business objectives, I am unable to accept $12,500 for the product. I would like to propose a price of $13,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
