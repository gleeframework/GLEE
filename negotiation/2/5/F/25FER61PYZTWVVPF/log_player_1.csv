Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but it's still within a range where a deal is possible.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It clearly states the price and gives Bob a reason to consider the offer. 

This strategy sets the stage for a negotiation where you can potentially earn more than $900,000 if Bob is willing to come up.  However, you also have the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if you can get a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **It's still above your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **It reiterates your value:**  The message reminds Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer.

This approach keeps the negotiation open and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
