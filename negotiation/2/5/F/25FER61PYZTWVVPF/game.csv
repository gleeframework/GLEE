"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target value. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
