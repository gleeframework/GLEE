"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is closer to my budget and what I believe is a fair price.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This price would be a good compromise and would allow us both to be satisfied with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
