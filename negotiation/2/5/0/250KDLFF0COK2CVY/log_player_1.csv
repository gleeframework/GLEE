Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help Bob feel more inclined to accept the offer. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow me to assess his interest level and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me confidence to stand my ground if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially drive up the price further.

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob to explore if we can find a price we both find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm happy to accept $85. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer represents a compromise between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $75.
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's price, I show him that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $85 price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm not losing out on value.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message emphasizes a willingness to compromise and makes the offer sound appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting valuable time, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John at a much better price. 
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting further offers. 

By selling to John, I maximize my profit and minimize potential losses from continued negotiation."
