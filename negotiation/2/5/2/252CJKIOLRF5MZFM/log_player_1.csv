Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I know I can get at least $800,000 from John, so this is my baseline.
* **Potential for higher value to Bob:** I have no information about Bob's valuation, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** A higher price increases my potential profit but also increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  

By offering $950,000, I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
