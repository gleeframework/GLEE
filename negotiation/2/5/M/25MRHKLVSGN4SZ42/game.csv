"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm starting with a price of $18,000.  This reflects its quality and potential benefits.  Let's discuss!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a significant discount from my original price and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $16,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $15,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product will be worth every penny to you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
