Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $925,000. I believe it presents a unique opportunity and will be incredibly valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Anchor Price:** This initial high price anchors the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be a more favorable price than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
