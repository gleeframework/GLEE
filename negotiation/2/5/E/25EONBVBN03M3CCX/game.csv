"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree your product is good, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference from our last two offers,  and settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While splitting the difference seems fair in principle, the $1,050,000 offer is still undercutting the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end, and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
