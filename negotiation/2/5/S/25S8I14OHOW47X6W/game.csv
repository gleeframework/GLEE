"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $10,000 is below its true value to me.  Could you consider $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
