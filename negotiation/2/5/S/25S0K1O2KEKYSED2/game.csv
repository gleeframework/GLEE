"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $800,000. This aligns more closely with the value I see in the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000? This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a significant advantage.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still allows for a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 still doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad you've been flexible in our negotiations. I think we're getting closer. I would like to counter with a price of $860,000. I believe this strikes a balance between your original offer and my valuation.",860000.0,Bob,6,
