"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I can only afford to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about $14,000? It's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I still can't go above $12,000. I hope we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $12,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $13,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close this negotiation quickly. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I can't go below $12,500, but I am willing to meet you halfway. Would $12,750 work for you?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  While I'm willing to work with you, $12,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $13,000.  This way, we both get a fair deal, and we can finalize this quickly. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
