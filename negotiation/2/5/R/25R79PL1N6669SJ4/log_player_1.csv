Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $10,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to offer a price lower than that to Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at your desired price provides room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. 
* **Confidence:** Presenting the offer confidently without revealing your minimum price can be advantageous.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have time for a potential counter-offer from Bob. If time is a critical factor, you might consider a slightly lower offer to increase the likelihood of a quick acceptance."
