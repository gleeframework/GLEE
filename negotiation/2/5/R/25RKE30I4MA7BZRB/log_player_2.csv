"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a somewhat reasonable price, you can get the product for $10 less from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her offering a lower price, or you can always go with John as a backup."
