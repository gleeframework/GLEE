"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,4,
