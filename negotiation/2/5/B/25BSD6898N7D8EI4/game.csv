"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. To show my willingness to continue negotiating, I'm offering $9500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I think that's my limit. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
