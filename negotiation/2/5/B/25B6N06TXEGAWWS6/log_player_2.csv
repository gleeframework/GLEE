Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While your initial price is a bit lower than I'd hoped,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm prepared to reduce my asking price to $1350000. This reflects a compromise on my end and demonstrates my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit further.  I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution in this round."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm eager to reach an agreement, $1275000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to reduce my asking price to $1325000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique nature and value of this product. Let's work together to close this deal in this round.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,325,000, which is only $50,000 higher than your last counteroffer.  This is a reasonable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal falling apart. It's likely that Alice is not going to go lower, and you're only 5 rounds away from having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the best strategy to ensure you get the product and save some money."
