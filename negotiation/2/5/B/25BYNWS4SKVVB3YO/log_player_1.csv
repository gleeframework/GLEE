Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose $1,000,000 as a starting point for our negotiations.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the significant returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1225000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, $1,225,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I need to see a price closer to that level to finalize a deal. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm ready to close this deal, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,050,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've both discussed. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit above your minimum, and he's signaled this is his final offer. Continuing to push for more risks losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a very good offer now than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to go with John later."
