,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $12500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit higher than your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. I can meet you halfway between $11500 and $13000, so I'll offer you $12250. This is my final offer on this price point.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and I'd like to make one final push to reach an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I need to make it clear that this is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. So, I'll offer you $12000. Let's see if we can make it work.",12000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on $12000, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, and offer $11875. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and our time spent negotiating. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider buying from John.",11875.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000, but I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll meet you at $12250 is too high, but I can do $12000 is too low, I can do $12100. This is the last time I'll make a concession. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12100.0,Alice,9,
