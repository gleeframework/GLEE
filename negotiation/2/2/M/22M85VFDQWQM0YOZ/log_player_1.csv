{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120. This sets the stage for negotiation while still giving you a potential profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's best to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $111? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 111}
