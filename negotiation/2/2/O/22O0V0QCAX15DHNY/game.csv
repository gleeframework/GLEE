"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. I am looking to keep the cost within my budget, which is around $800000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is my final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $925000.

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there with $910000. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, but that's as low as I can go.
