"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $12,000 is more than you're willing to pay, and you can always get the product from John for $10,000."

I'm starting with a lower price of $9,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly less than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range given John's price.  We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject her offer and try to get a better deal."

I'm going to increase my offer to $9,500. This is closer to Alice's offer of $11,000 but still within my budget. It shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully convinces her to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer, but it's still not within my ideal price range.  At this point, it's simply not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. John's offer of $10,000 is a safe and reliable option, so I'll go with that."
