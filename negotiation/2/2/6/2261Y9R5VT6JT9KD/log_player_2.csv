"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the $15,000 John is charging, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, so it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than the $15,000 John is charging, there are still 7 rounds remaining.  Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a little hesitant at $13,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12500}
