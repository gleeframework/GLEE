{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my ideal price. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers. If he rejects my offer outright, I might consider lowering it slightly, but I won't go below $1,750,000 without a strong reason. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to negotiate further to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,750,000, which is still a good profit for me, but also a considerable step down from my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate for a sale.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to increase his offer, especially since he rejected the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer, but I'll be prepared to walk away if he continues to be unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but it still gives me a substantial profit.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a genuine attempt to meet him halfway and finally offer a price closer to my expectations. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as it seems Bob is unwilling to negotiate in good faith."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and it's clear he's not willing to negotiate in good faith. I've lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  John's offer provides me with a much better deal, and I'll take it to avoid further haggling with Bob."
