{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price.  You can save money if you get her lower than $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm hoping she'll see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking losing the deal altogether."

Alice is still too high for my comfort zone. I will continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $710,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to save as much money as possible.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."

Alice is still above my ideal price, but we're getting closer.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a final price closer to my target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 720000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway and offer $720,000.  This is a solid offer that shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. While I'd like to save more money, accepting this offer is the best choice. It's the closest we've gotten to my target, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to get the product for a slightly higher price than to lose the opportunity and be forced to buy from John at $800,000."
