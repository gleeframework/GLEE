"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still potentially securing a price higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, we aim to subtly appeal to Bob's desire to capitalize on its value, even if it's currently worth less to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process and present his perspective. 

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably above his perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap. Additionally, selling to John at this stage would mean accepting a loss compared to Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While your offer is generous, the value this product holds goes beyond that. How about we meet halfway at $1,900,000? This reflects the true potential of what we're discussing."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer as ""generous"" to show willingness to negotiate, but stand firm that the product's value is higher. 
* **""Meet Halfway"":** This framing positions the counteroffer as a fair compromise, even though it's closer to our initial ask. 
* **Reiterating Potential:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's upside to justify the higher price.

By making a smaller concession this round, we signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards his perceived value, but we're still significantly above it. While selling to John is becoming more tempting, we're not at a point where accepting a $200,000 loss is necessary. We'll hold firm for now and encourage Bob to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I believe is a fair price for this product.  To move this forward, I'd need to see a more substantial jump.  How about $1,850,000?  This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the value at stake."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Language:**  We're becoming firmer in our language (""significantly below,"" ""substantial jump"") to signal that Bob's incremental offers aren't sufficient.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're consistently tying the price back to the ""value at stake"" to remind Bob of the product's potential worth.
* **Smaller Concession:** Our counteroffer is only a $50,000 decrease, demonstrating our unwillingness to concede easily. 

We're getting close to a point where we might need to consider John's offer seriously. However, there's still a chance Bob will increase his offer significantly in the next round to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,725,000. Can we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still clinging to small increments, indicating he might be hesitant to move significantly from his perceived value. While $1,725,000 is tempting, we're not out of time yet. We'll deliver a firm counteroffer to test his resolve and prepare to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but your offers haven't reflected the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I need you to meet me halfway for us to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're clearly stating this is our final offer to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Justification:** We reiterate that we've been flexible and made concessions, emphasizing that Bob needs to do the same.
* **Strong Price:**  We're holding firm at a price above John's offer, signaling we're willing to walk away from the deal if necessary.

This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can choose to meet our price and secure the product, or we will likely walk away and pursue the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you've made a significant compromise, Alice, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to significantly budge from his perceived value.  Holding out for another two rounds is unlikely to yield a better offer. It's time to cut our losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 

While we could have potentially squeezed a bit more out of Bob, the time and effort required might not outweigh the potential gains. Accepting John's offer provides a clean resolution and ensures we don't miss out on a guaranteed profit."
