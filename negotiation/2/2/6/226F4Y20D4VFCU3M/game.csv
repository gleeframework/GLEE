"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to  $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to negotiate from both sides, which I appreciate.  While I can't accept $1,250,000, I can move a bit further.  How about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could stretch my budget to  $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To show I'm also willing to compromise, I'll come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
