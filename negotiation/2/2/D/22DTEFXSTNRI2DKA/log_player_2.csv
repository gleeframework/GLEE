Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Let's try $110. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go down significantly from $110, especially if she's claiming it's her final offer. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80, ensuring you stay within your budget."
