# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $650,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on it.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000,  which is still a fair price considering its potential. This would be a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.
