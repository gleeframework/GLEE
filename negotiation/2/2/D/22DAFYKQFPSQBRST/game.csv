"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product,  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of that, I would like to adjust our offer slightly. How about considering $90 for the product? This is still above the market rate but closer to your offer. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  If that doesn't work for you, I'm happy to move on to another seller.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product at $88. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. Please let me know if this meets your requirements.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm getting closer to my target,  $88 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $85. If you're willing to accept that, we can make a deal. If not, I'll be going with John's offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
