"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. My initial offer for the product is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, there is no benefit to accepting it.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me at this time.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer, demonstrating his intent to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Show Interest:** He expresses interest in the product to keep the negotiation positive and avoid a complete impasse.
* **Room for Compromise:** The $1,100,000 offer leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to counter without feeling overly pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1150000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is exactly halfway between Bob's original counteroffer of $1,100,000 and her initial offer of $1,200,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Saving Money:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds total, it's beneficial to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk prolonging negotiations and potentially losing the deal."
