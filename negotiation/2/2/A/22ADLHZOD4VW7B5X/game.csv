"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your offer of $10500, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $11500, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $11500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $11000 is a bit too low for me. How about we try $11250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
