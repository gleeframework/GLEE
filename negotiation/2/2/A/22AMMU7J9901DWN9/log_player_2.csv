"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $120 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within Bob's budget.  It leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a bit of a budget, Bob.  I can't do $120, but how about we meet halfway at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating to see if a better price can be reached.  If Alice continues to hold firm, Bob can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying but is still within his budget.  It also positions him to potentially accept Alice's next offer if it's close."
