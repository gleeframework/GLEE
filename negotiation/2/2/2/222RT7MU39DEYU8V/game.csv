"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the significant value this product offers, particularly to someone like yourself.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I can't accept a price as low as $1,100,000. Would you consider $1,225,000?  I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000? I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen to strike a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make a final offer at $1,190,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your decision.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
