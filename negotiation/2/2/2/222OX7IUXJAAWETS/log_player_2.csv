# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.

While $925,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still above the price I'm aiming for.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my ideal range."

Alice has come back to her original offer of $900,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's still a good deal for me, especially compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  I'll accept this offer."
