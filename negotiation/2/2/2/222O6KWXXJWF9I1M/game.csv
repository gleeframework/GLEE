"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,500 is still too low. If you're serious about buying the product, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a final offer, and then I'll have to consider other options.  Let me know your final decision.",9500.0,Alice,5,
