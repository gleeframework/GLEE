Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  Since I know John is willing to pay $15,000, I can afford to be a bit aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is still a good amount, I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $16,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to reach a deal closer to my preferred price, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  Bob's latest offer is getting too low, and I'm concerned that further negotiation will only result in a lower price.  While selling to John means I don't get my desired price, it's still a better option than accepting a price I'm not comfortable with."
