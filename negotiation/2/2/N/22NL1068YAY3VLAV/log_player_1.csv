Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives Bob a good opportunity to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a price above my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than what John is offering.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a substantial profit for me, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and while I'd like to keep negotiating, I'm not willing to risk further haggling. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, so I'm going to sell to John."
