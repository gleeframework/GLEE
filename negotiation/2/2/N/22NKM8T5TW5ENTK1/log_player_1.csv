Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your $12,000 value as possible. 
* **Beat John's Offer:** You know John will buy it for $12,000, so offering it slightly below that to Bob makes it more appealing.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $11,999 is a high price, but it leaves a small margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while maximizing your profit.

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob while still getting a price very close to your minimum."
