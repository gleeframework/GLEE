"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with something. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $92. This is a good price, and it's important to remember that I'm already in the 4th round of negotiation. I'm not sure if I can get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob."
