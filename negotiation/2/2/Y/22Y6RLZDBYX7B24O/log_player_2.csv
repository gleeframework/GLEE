I'm starting with a low offer to see how much bargaining power I have.  It's far enough below Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation but still above her value, so there's a chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $110.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her minimum, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and try to push a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Could you do $115? That's a fair price."",

}
```

I'm inching closer to her price, showing willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a good deal.  The language is polite and positions the offer as mutually beneficial."
