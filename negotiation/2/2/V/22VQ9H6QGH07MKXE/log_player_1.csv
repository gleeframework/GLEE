Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a quick and profitable sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants, while still securing a good profit for me.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John ($100), so I won't go drastically lower than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. I know he values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal and open the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $108?  It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from it."",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm suggesting a price that's slightly closer to my initial offer than Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him why he was willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $100, giving me some leverage in the negotiation. I won't go below this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still believe $100 would be a fair price for me given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $100 and hasn't budged. This indicates he's unlikely to go any higher.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
