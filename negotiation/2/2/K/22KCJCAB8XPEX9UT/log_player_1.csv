"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential benefit for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting high, I create space to negotiate down while still maximizing my profits. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I have the backup option of selling to John for $12,000, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is a fair price considering the market value. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I can sell to John for $12,000, I'm not willing to settle for $9,000 just yet. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get Bob to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more than $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That gives you a good deal, and still lets me cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""good deal"" for Bob to emphasize the benefit for him.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" Option:** I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. There's still room to negotiate with Bob and possibly get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can we meet at $9,250, which is closer to my target price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's offer has moved closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still potential for Bob to come up a little higher. 
* **Balancing Risk:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm still willing to take a chance with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference at $9,375?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not going all the way. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as ""fair"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Pressure to Close:**  By suggesting a ""fair"" price and suggesting ""making this deal work,"" I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to close the deal.
* **Still above Minimum:** This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, which gives me some buffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $9,125. This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offers, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not ready to settle just yet. With four rounds remaining, there's still potential for Bob to come up a little higher, or for me to potentially reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price.
* **Balancing Risk:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm still willing to take a chance with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference again at $9,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reiterating the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, allowing me some buffer.

With only three rounds remaining, I need to start pushing for a deal, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to make a serious offer now: $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and he's stated it's his final offer.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob increases.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, selling to John ensures I secure a profitable deal and avoids further risk."
