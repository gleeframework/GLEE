{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's value, but I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get for this product. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $950000. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, $875,000 is a decent deal considering Bob's budget limitations. It's significantly better than selling to John, and the negotiation process has already taken some time. It's time to close the deal."
