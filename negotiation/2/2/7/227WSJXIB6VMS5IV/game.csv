"Alice, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable offer. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, acknowledging the value this product holds for you. It's a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but there's still a gap for us to bridge. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $950,000 is still a significant distance from where I need to be. Given your continued interest, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value this product holds for you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  I believe that's a very fair offer considering it's more than halfway between our last two offers.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Given the time constraints and the value this product holds for both of us, I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,150,000. This offer is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally strike a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
