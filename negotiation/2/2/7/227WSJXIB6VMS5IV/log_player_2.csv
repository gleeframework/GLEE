Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you.  You're better off taking the guaranteed savings with John."
