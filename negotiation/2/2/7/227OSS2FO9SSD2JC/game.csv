"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still significantly below the value I believe this product holds for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident you'll find this price is still very beneficial.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
