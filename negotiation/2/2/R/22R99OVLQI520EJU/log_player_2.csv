{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's price of $8,000, Bob can likely negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. Offering $9,000 is a good starting point for the negotiation. This price is still higher than John's offer but leaves room for potential compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price.  He can likely get it lower by continuing to negotiate. He also has the safety net of John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer shows some compromise while still maintaining the negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He also has the security of John's offer to fall back on if necessary."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time he's only going up by $500. This shows Alice that he's serious about closing the deal but he is still trying to get the best price possible. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to make a final concession."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is very close to Bob's desired price.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his next offer and potentially losing the deal is high. It's also getting late in the negotiation process with only a few rounds left. Accepting this offer will give Bob a good deal while mitigating the risk of not securing the product."
