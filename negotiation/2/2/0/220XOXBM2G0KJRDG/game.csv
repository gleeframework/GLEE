"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $11,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? It seems like a fair compromise.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,7,
