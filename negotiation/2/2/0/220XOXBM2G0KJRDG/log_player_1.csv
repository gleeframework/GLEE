Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
