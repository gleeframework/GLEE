Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is not budging enough, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has diminishing returns and you risk ending up with a worse deal."
