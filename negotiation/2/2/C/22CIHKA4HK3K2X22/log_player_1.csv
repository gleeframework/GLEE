Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To be frank, $15,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. My absolute maximum is $14,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to buy today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go above $14,000. While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting risky. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
