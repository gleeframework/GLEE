Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.

The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive, highlighting the potential value to Bob."
