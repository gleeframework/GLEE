"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value on the market.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can go up to $700,000. This is my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $700,000 simply won't work for me. This product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $800,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
