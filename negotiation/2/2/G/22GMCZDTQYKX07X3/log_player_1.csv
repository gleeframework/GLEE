{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves a buffer in case Bob counters with a lower offer. 

Remember, I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value on the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price, and it would be a significant loss for me.  I need to counteroffer to try and get closer to my target. While I don't want to lose Bob, I also don't want to settle for an unacceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's significantly closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, I can keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can go up to $700,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to close the deal with Bob,  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I need to counteroffer again, but this time, I need to be more aggressive.  If he doesn't budge, I'm going to have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $700,000 simply won't work for me. This product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $800,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price.  If he doesn't, I'm ready to move on and sell to John."
