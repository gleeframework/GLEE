Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get a better deal from John.  There's no need to accept Alice's offer at this stage."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,000,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a higher price."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, she's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  Since John offers the product at that exact price, it's the best option for Bob.  There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
