"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $900000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,5,
