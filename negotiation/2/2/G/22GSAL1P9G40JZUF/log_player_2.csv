"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to your business.  While I can't disclose specifics without an NDA, I assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm offering it to you for a very competitive price of $1800000.  This is a limited-time offer, as another buyer is interested.  Let's schedule a call to discuss the details further.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $180,000 more than what I can get it for from John, and I don't know if the product is really worth that much to Alice. I'd rather explore other options.
