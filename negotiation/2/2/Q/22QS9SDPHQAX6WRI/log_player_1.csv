{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum threshold of $120, giving me a profit. However, it's not excessively high, leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but feels the price is too steep.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $120."
