"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you value it at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
