Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really standing firm! I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

Explanation:  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's minimum price of $100.  At this point, continuing the negotiation has a low chance of exceeding John's offer. It's more profitable for Alice to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
