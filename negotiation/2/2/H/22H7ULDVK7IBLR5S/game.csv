"Alice, your product sounds great, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to buy from John otherwise.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12500 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",13000.0,Alice,5,
