Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $110 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Above my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I profit.
* **Not too high:** $110 is likely within Bob's range, as it's still below his perceived value of $80. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum of $120, so I can afford to reject this offer and try to get a better price.
* **Room to negotiate:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, allowing for further negotiation.
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is the midpoint between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95), demonstrating flexibility.
* **Still profitable:** $102.50 is still above my minimum price of $120, ensuring a profit for me.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes a ""fair deal"" for both parties, making Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still working within a tight budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $100 is slightly lower than my ideal, it's only $20 below what I would get from John.
* **Negotiations are long:**  We've been going back and forth for a while, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting Bob's offer might open the door for future sales with him, even if this deal is slightly less profitable."
