Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm framing the offer as a valuable opportunity for Bob, without revealing too much about the product's specific details. This can pique his interest and make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price further, signaling that I'm open to some flexibility. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maintaining a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's interest indicates he values the product, and I can likely secure a higher price through counteroffers.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which serves as a floor for my negotiations with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it to you for $12,000.  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and fair deal:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while also emphasizing the value of the product. This can make my position seem more reasonable.
* **Meeting halfway:**  The $12,000 counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Continuing the conversation:** I'm again inviting Bob to continue the negotiation, indicating that I'm still open to reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties and hopefully leads to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to lose any money by accepting this offer.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  Since Bob has met my minimum, there's no need to continue the negotiation.  Any further counteroffers would likely lead to a stalemate.
* **Selling to Bob vs. John:** While selling to John would be just as profitable, selling to Bob offers the potential for a future relationship or further sales.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a fair deal and potentially opening up a long-term relationship with a satisfied customer."
