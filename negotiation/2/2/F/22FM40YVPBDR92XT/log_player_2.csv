# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This product holds significant value for me, but I understand its worth might vary based on your specific requirements. I am offering it to you for $120, which I believe strikes a balance between its intrinsic value and your perceived worth. Don't hesitate to let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you need more information about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price or you can proceed to get the best deal from John."
