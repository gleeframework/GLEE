"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $11,500. This offer stands as a compromise to get us both what we want.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a decent amount and allowing me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the continued effort to find a compromise.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 to show my commitment to buying this product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
