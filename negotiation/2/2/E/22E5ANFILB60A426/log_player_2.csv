"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer.  This will lead her to potentially propose a lower price, and even if not, you can always buy from John for $100."
