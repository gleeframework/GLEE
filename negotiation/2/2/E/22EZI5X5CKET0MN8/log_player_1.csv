``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price, but also want to avoid losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is low, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give up too much profit. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum."
