"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is low, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're willing to meet in the middle, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you at $10,250. This is a good compromise and allows us to both get a fair deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
