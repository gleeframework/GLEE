"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,500 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:While Alice's offer of $9,500 is below my maximum budget, I can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a better counter-offer, or I can buy from John and save $500."
