Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is considerably lower than what I can accept.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.
