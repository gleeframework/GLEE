"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price. You have a clear upper limit of $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

``` 

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $10,000 and John is selling the product for $10,000. It's a good compromise and saves you $1,000 compared to John's offer."
