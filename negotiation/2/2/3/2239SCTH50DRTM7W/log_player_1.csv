{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also acknowledges his potential value for the product, making the offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $15,000 just yet.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000?  It's a compromise that gets us both closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you halfway. I would like to propose $15500 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $16,000, it's better to secure the sale at a reasonable price than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to John or end up with a lower price."
