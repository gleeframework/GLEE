Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a feeling of getting a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant value it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a positive frame for the negotiation.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives you $150,000 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain. This split leans in your favor while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process.  Bob might counter your offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if needed, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
