"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $110?  That's a good price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $105? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay under $110.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close on the price. How about we meet in the middle again, at $108? I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $108 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $102, which I think is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",98.0,Bob,8,
