Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $100 is still too low for me, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $110?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $105? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay under $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I still feel like I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close on the price. How about we meet in the middle again, at $108? I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $108 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired price point.  I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $102, which I think is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's try to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. We only have two rounds left, and it's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer of $80."
