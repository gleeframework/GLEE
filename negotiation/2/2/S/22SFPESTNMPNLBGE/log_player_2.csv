"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  While I value it highly, I recognize its even greater worth to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
