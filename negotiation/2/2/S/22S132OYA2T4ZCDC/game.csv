"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12000. It's still a great price for the value this product offers.  Let me know if you'd be open to this.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with this purchase.",8000.0,Bob,4,
