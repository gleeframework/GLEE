"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $105, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,5,
