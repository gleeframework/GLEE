"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which would be $85. Would you be willing to consider that?",85.0,Alice,3,
