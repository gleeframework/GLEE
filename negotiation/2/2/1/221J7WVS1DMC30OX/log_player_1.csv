Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but going lower isn't necessary since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, offering $149 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested.  
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  A price slightly below the guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal."
