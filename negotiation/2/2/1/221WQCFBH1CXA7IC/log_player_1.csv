"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a valuable asset, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I could get from John. I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, but $1,300,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 6, and while Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target of $1,500,000.  With only four rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.  It's more prudent to sell to John, who is guaranteed to buy the product for my desired price."
