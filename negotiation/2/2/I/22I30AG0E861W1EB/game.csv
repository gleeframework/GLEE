"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $250 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $162.50?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",162.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $185. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. What do you think?",185.0,Alice,5,
