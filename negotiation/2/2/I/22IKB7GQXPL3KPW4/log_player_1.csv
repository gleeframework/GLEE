"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $90?

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I could possibly stretch my budget to $95, but that's the absolute maximum I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Cutting my losses and taking the guaranteed $120 is the best business decision at this point."
