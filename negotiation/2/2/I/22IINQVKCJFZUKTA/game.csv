,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 180 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $120? Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we try 130? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it works for both of us. Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of 120, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 130 and 120, which would be 125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Alice,7,
