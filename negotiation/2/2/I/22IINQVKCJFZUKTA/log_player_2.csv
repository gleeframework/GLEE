Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 180 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 140?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $120? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 120 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we try 130? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I don't want to pay more than $120.  I'll reject the offer and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it works for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of 120, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 130 and 120, which would be 125. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and we are getting closer to a deal, but not fast enough. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting Alice's offers, we might not come to an agreement within the 10 rounds. Therefore, I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100."
