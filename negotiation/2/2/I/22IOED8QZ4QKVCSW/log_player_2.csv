Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a valuable item, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy it now.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
