"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save even more money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from her initial price and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. Continuing to negotiate might save a bit more money, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing the product to John outweighs the potential benefit. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a good price and avoid further negotiation."
