"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
