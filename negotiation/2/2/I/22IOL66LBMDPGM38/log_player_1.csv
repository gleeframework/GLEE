{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic starting point:

* **It's attractive to Bob:** $1,100,000 is still a good price for him, as he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $100,000 gap between your desired price and Bob's valuation, which allows for potential bargaining.
* **It's higher than John's offer:** This ensures you're not losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000 if Bob rejects the offer.

By starting with this offer, you create a good starting point for negotiation while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget and I'm trying to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I would like to get for the product. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far below my minimum price point of $1,200,000. 

I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a more favorable price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's closer to your budget, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet Bob halfway:**  Offering $1,000,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlight the value:**  By stating ""it's still a great deal for you,"" you remind Bob of the product's worth and the potential for him to gain.
* **Reiterate your minimum:** Although you've come down from your initial offer, you're still significantly above your minimum price point, ensuring you don't sell for less than your acceptable limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $980,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that amount. I will reject his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $980,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise. This way, we both can get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above the minimum:** $1,050,000 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring you're not selling at a loss.
* **Show flexibility:** While you've come down from your previous offer, you're still not accepting Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not be pressured.
* **Frame it as a compromise:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""good deal"" encourages Bob to see the offer as beneficial to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not sure if $1,050,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price point. I've already made several concessions, and it seems unlikely he'll go any higher. To avoid further negotiations and ensure a profit, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
