Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant amount less than what it's worth to him, giving him a good incentive to buy.  However, it's also a sizable amount more than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a good profit. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also setting a strong starting point."

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him.  It also allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a final compromise, meeting Bob's last offer halfway. It's still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him. It also gets me a higher price than John's offer, making it a more favorable outcome. 

By staying firm and pushing for a fair price, I've managed to secure a good deal for myself."
