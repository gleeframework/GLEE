"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no point in buying from John yet, since you might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my price point and forces Alice to decide if she's willing to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm going to try to push for a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, and I still have the option of buying from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Alice to come down to a price I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget. While I am getting closer to my target price, there's still some room for negotiation. If I reject, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push with my counteroffer. $1,050,000 is a compromise, it's not my ideal price but it's close enough that I think Alice might accept it.  If she rejects, I'll go with John."
