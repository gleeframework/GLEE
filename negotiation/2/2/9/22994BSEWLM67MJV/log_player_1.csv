I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll be willing to negotiate, but I won't drop below my minimum value.  I'll also consider how much time and effort I'm willing to invest in this negotiation before potentially accepting John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for potential profit. I'm aiming to find a price point that's agreeable to both of us without compromising too much on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly closer to my minimum than John's offer of $1,000,000, but it's still less than what I initially hoped for.  Given that we've already been through a few rounds of negotiation and Bob doesn't seem likely to budge much further, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,250,000. It's a good deal overall, and I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially getting a worse offer in the future."
