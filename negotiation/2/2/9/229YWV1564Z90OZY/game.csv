"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for a product of this quality.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range. While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $12,750. This is a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, I do like the product.  $12,750 is still a bit high for me though.  How about we split the difference one last time and land at $12,000 even? I think that's more than fair.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already told you that I'm not willing to go below $12,750. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I'm willing to give you one more chance, but I'm going to increase the price to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously.",13000.0,Alice,7,
