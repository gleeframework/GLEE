Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already told you that I'm not willing to go below $12,750. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I'm willing to give you one more chance, but I'm going to increase the price to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously.

Alice is clearly not budging from her position and is even trying to increase the price. It's time to cut your losses and go with John, who's offering a fair price."
