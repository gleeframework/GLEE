"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $70? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $70 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $85? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find the product's value is well worth it.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",77.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I think $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $82? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find the product's value is well worth it.",82.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the price I was originally willing to pay. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you accept that?",80.0,Bob,8,
