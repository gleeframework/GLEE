"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair deal considering the product's value to him and my time spent negotiating.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
