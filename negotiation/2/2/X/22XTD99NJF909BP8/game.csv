"I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $112.50 is a good starting point.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $118.75.  That way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",118.75,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $118.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
