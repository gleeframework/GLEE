Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to see if Bob is truly interested and has a strong budget.  This also allows me to gauge his initial response and potentially negotiate down from there. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also leaves room for potential further bargaining."
