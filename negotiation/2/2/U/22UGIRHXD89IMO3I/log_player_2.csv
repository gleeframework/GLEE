"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $15,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it is still above the $10,000 threshold that Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, but  keeping in mind that Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's ideal price of $10,000 and Alice's current offer of $13,000. It shows a willingness to negotiate but also sticks to the limit that Bob has set for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit of $10,000. There are still rounds available, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  There is still a possibility Alice may come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but there's still room to push for a better price. This offer is only slightly higher than his previous one and shows a willingness to compromise.  The goal is to see if Alice is willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit of $10,000, but it's getting closer. There are still rounds available, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. There is a possibility Alice may come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final offer. It's his maximum price and is aligned with John's offer.  There are only two rounds left, so it's time to put his foot down and see if Alice is willing to accept. If she doesn't, Bob has a backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, the risk of further negotiation is too high. Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit of $10,000.  It's safer to go with John's offer, which guarantees the product for $10,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept the final counteroffer, and Bob doesn't want to risk missing out on the product entirely."
