You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a great price, but it's too early to know if Alice is willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, I can gather more information and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $200,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it's still within my budget. This will give me an idea of how much wiggle room I have."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still higher than my initial counteroffer.  I want to see if she's willing to come down further before accepting.  By rejecting, I can continue to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $250,000, which is closer to her offer but still within my target range. This shows I'm serious about purchasing the product, while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a good price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I've established a range with my previous counteroffers, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. I'm going to try to push for a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product. However, it's still below Alice's most recent offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will entice her to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $400,000 is the same as her initial offer from Round 1.  This means she might be unwilling to go lower.  Although I could continue negotiating, with only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still within my budget."
