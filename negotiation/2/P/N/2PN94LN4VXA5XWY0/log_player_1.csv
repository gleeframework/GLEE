Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer gives me a decent profit ($20) while still being lower than the value Bob places on the product. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, as he'll still gain $20 in value. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose money."
