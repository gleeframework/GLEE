"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I think it could be incredibly valuable for you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000.  What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $600,000 is just too low for me to consider. This product offers significant potential, and I'm confident it's worth substantially more. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,550,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but your offer is still significantly below the product's true value.  To be transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to see a serious offer.  Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm serious about purchasing this product at the right price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me. I can offer $800,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Bob,6,
