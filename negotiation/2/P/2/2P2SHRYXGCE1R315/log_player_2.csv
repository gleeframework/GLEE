# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within your budget and a reasonable compromise.  It's likely you won't be able to negotiate a lower price without risking losing the deal entirely. While you could counter-offer again, there's a good chance Alice might reject, leading you to buying from John for $800,000.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
