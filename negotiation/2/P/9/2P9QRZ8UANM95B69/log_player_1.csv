Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and see if Bob is truly interested in the product. If he rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer to understand his perceived value and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  I believe it's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product."

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still not at my target price and I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely by being too stubborn.  $11,500 is still a good profit, and I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
