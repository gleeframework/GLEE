"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I think that's fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $95.  Would you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95. How about we try $102.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",102.5,Alice,5,
