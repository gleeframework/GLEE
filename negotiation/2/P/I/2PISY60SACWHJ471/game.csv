"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we settle at $950,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a significant investment, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
