Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,200,000, reflecting its exceptional value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still gives you a significant benefit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget for this, so I'd be willing to meet you at $900,000. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make a final compromise.  How about we settle on $950,000? This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows us both to reach a fair agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for you, Bob. You're getting the product for $50,000 less than John's price and Alice seems firm on her final compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
