"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $80 is quite a bit lower than your initial asking price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
