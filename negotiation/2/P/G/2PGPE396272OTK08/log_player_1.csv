{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at no less than $10,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me some room to negotiate and leaves the impression that I'm open to a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Offering $9,500  leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without immediately feeling like I'm too inflexible.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** This offer is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This puts pressure on him to either accept or make a counteroffer that's more in line with my valuation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the security to walk away if Bob is too stubborn and refuses to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I need to keep negotiating to try and get a better deal.  Selling to John for $10,000 would be the safest option, but I'd prefer to explore whether I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  how about $9,000?  This still allows you a significant saving, and it's a fair price considering my valuation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm offering a counter-proposal that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that $9,000 still represents a significant saving for Bob, compared to his perceived value.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not going to drop my price much lower than this, but it leaves the door open for some further negotiation.
* **Maintaining the Pressure:** I'm keeping the pressure on Bob to make a decision.  I want him to realize that selling to John for $10,000 is always an option for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to see if I can push for a price closer to $9,000.  Selling to John for $10,000 is still the safest option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  That's a fair price considering what the product is worth to you and it's the closest I can get to my desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer. I'm only willing to go down $100 from my previous offer.  This shows that I'm serious about getting a deal but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $8,900 is still a good deal for Bob. It allows him to buy the product for less than its value to him, while also letting me get a price closer to what I want.
* **Setting a Deadline:** By saying ""Let's see if we can finalize this deal"", I'm implying that I won't continue negotiating much longer.  This adds pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,900, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has essentially returned to his original offer of $8,500.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result for me.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000.  This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further time-consuming negotiation."
