"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at no less than $10,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  how about $9,000?  This still allows you a significant saving, and it's a fair price considering my valuation.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  That's a fair price considering what the product is worth to you and it's the closest I can get to my desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
