Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly below the product's value and my minimum. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer.  It's time to close the deal."
