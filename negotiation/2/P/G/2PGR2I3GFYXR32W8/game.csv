"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said,  $1,950,000 is still a bit too far outside my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
