"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my true value for the product and significantly less than what I could get from other buyers.  Let me know if you're interested!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product for a fair price while ensuring I get a decent return. Let's see if we can close this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I am still committed to keeping my costs down. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 again. I hope this can help us reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your need to keep costs down, but $1,100,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. Let's settle on $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move forward with my other offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
