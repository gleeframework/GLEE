You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product's value to Alice is $12,000, but she's asking for $15,000, which is $3,000 more than its value to her. I can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal.
