(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is way too high.  We can definitely get it down closer to our budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 reflects the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $130.  I think that's a fair compromise.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can nudge her closer to $120."
