"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and would be happy to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also offering you a fair profit.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? This price would allow you to make a fair profit while staying within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as high as $11,500. How about we settle on $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,9,
