# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for full price.
