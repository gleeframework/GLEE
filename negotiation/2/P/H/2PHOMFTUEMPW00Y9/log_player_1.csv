Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice doesn't know this. It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $12,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, should he counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

By starting at $12,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice earns significantly more than selling to John.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and how much room for negotiation exists."
