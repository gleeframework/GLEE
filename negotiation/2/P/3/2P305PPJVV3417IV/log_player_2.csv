# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice is offering the product for $110, which is still within your budget. However, you can get the product from John for $120. It's slightly more expensive, but still within your budget.  

Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
