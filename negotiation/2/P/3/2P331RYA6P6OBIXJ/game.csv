"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still pretty far from what I'm looking for.  How about we do $15,500 and call it a deal?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
