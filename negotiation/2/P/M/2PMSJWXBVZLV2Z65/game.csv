"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it will be transformative for you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, I need to see the price closer to $750,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, but I want to assure you this product is a game-changer.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to see this deal happen, but I need you to meet me closer to that figure.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise shows you're serious about this deal, and so am I.  To be completely transparent, $900,000 is the highest I can go. If we can make that work, I'm ready to finalize everything today.",900000.0,Bob,6,
