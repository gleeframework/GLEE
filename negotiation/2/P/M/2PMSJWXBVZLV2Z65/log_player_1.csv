Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is still very low. We'll hold firm and see if we can bring him up significantly in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise shows you're serious about this deal, and so am I.  To be completely transparent, $900,000 is the highest I can go. If we can make that work, I'm ready to finalize everything today.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. While it's slightly below my ideal price, it's a strong offer.  

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $900,000 is a significant amount of money, and while it's less than my initial ask, it's still a considerable return. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations.  Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away.
* **Bird in Hand:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, but the difference of $100,000 isn't large enough to risk losing a deal with Bob entirely. 

It's always possible to hold out for more, but in a negotiation, recognizing a good offer when it's on the table is crucial."
