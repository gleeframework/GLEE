"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  Based on its potential to benefit your operations, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000, a price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum and saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While Alice believes it's worth more, her offer represents a mutually beneficial price point."
