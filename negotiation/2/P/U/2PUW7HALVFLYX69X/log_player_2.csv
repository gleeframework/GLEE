"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value to both parties. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, is worth $1,500,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I am proposing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and ensuring that you receive a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us to achieve our financial goals. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price closer to her actual valuation."
