Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice has a strong fallback. She starts high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the price:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a deal with Bob above his perceived value:**  If Bob values potential future benefits, he might be willing to pay above $800,000.
2. **Maintain a profitable fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
