"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while also ensuring we both benefit from this transaction. Let's find a common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
