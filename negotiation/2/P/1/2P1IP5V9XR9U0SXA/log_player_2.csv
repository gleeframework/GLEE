Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from your initial offer. However, $825,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to go down to $775,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to go below her current offer of $775,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to cut your losses and take that deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the price remaining above your budget."
