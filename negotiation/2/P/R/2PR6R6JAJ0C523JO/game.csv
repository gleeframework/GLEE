"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product holds value, but I need to stay within a certain budget. How about $760,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to reach a fair deal.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate it.  How about we split the difference? $800,000 would be a fair price, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
