{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95.  It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the value Bob will get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. There's a chance he might be willing to compromise a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you, and it allows me to get a little closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still interested in the product for $80. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $80 offer, and while I could make another counteroffer, I'm not sure it will be successful. I'm already at my minimum price, and further negotiation risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Selling to John for $80 guarantees me a sale and ensures I don't lose out on any profit."
