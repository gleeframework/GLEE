Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him to John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $115 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, but still secures a significant profit above your minimum ($100).
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the product's value to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome for you while considering Bob's willingness to pay."
