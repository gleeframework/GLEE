"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can both benefit from a slightly lower price. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to think about my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $850000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more value out of this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer. How about we meet at $800000? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get this deal done, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $825000? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer.
