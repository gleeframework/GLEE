Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you know he's interested but wants to discuss the price.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($12,000) if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
