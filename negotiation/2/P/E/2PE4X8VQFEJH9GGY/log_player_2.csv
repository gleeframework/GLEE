"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He has a lot of room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $15,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $13,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, $13,000 is still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. My revised offer is $12,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above his budget, and he has already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiations and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
