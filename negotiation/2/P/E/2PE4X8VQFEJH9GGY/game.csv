"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $15,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $13,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. My revised offer is $12,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
