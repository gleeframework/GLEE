Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too low for me, even though he is the only buyer right now. I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500 this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for $10,500.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

While $9,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's go with $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be great to finally close this deal.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  The negotiations with Bob have been going on for a while, and I'm not sure if we'll ever come to an agreement.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
