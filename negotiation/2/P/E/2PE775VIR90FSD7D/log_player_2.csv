"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum price of $8,000. This is a strong opening position that shows he's serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. The message is friendly and emphasizes a willingness to reach a deal."

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500 this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
