"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  It's the maximum you're willing to pay, and there's a chance you can get a better deal.  Rejecting allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower offer is a common tactic in negotiation. It establishes a clear starting point for discussion and encourages Alice to make concessions. By offering $1,000,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I believe its true value is lower than her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to continue pushing for a lower price, potentially getting closer to my ideal range.  It's important to remember that Alice may be willing to negotiate further, and by rejecting, I keep the negotiation dynamic alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for a compromise.  By offering $1,100,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet her halfway, while still maintaining a significant discount from her previous offer.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
