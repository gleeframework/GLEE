"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $115 is higher than your maximum price of $100.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not going to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum price of $100. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. There are still 7 rounds left, and I have the option to buy from John at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a little too high. I'm really only able to offer $108 at this time.  It's the most I can afford, and I'm hoping we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to my maximum, but still leaves room for compromise. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but not willing to pay her full asking price. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without immediately jumping to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $109? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within your budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109 is still above my maximum budget of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, I've now reached a point where I'm not sure how much further Alice is willing to come down, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  It's better to be safe and secure the product for $100 from John, rather than risk ending up paying more."
