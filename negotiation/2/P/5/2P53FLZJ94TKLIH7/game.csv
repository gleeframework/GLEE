"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I'm very interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,900. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10900.0,Alice,5,
