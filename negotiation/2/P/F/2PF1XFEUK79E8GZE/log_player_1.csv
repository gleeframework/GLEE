Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and this is a chance to acquire it before anyone else. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his value leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing there's a guaranteed sale at $800,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to go below that price."
