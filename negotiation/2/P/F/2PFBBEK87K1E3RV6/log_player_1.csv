{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above my minimum threshold, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's value of $15,000.  By expressing confidence in the value of the product, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
