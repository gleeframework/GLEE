Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives me leverage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $149 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a dollar or two, which is still a better outcome than selling to John."
