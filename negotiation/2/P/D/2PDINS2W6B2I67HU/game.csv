"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $800,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $750,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to gain value from this transaction.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $725,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
