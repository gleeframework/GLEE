"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm starting with a friendly and optimistic approach. This helps build rapport and sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** The price is high enough that I can make concessions without compromising my minimum value of $1,000,000.

**Important note:**  This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if I want to lower the price further, or explore selling to John."
