# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great deal considering its value. If you're not interested, I can always sell it to someone else for $150, but I'd rather see it go to someone who appreciates it as much as I do.  Let me know what you think!
