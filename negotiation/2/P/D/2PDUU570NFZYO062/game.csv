"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and for me, as it's worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me and $1,000,000 to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a good deal, as it's well below the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a good deal. Let's try to meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
