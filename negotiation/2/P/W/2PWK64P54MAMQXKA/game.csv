"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000? That's the highest I can go.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,012,500? This is a reasonable compromise, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let's close this deal!",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so how about $996,250? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",996250.0,Bob,6,
