Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to me, and it gives you room for a healthy profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential profit for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price, which keeps options open for further negotiation. 

This offer sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation with Bob, while also having the backup option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and secure a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much on my profit.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, or alternatively, sell to John for my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I start by showing understanding of Bob's desire for a good deal, but also reiterate that his offer is too low for me.
* **Counteroffer close to Bob's:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's close to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This increases the chances of a deal.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize that the price is still a ""great price"" for Bob, focusing on the potential benefit to him.
* **Call to action:** I encourage Bob to find a ""middle ground,"" suggesting further negotiation and a potential deal.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my acceptable price while still showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Although he's showing willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to risk going any lower. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired profit, and eliminates further rounds of negotiation with Bob, which might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
