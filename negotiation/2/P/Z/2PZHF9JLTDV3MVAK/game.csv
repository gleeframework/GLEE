"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still below what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the other offers I have.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to drop my price to $145 for the product. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's still a fair price for the value you'll get. Let's try to finalize this deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
