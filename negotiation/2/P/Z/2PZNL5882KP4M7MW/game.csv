"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, based on my financial considerations, I am unable to agree to $950,000. I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,4,
