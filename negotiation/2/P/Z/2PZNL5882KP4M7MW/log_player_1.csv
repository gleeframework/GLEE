Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum (which is $1,200,000 from John). This leaves room to potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John is a Better Option:**  I can immediately get $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to settle for a lower price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Although Bob's offer is too low, it does signal his willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to find a middle ground closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm not going to accept Bob's low offer, but I'm also not immediately jumping to John's offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning with Justification:**  I'm giving Bob a reason for my counteroffer:  ""This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to cover my costs."" This is more persuasive than simply stating a number.
* **Leaving Space for Adjustment:** $950,000 is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to his value. This leaves room for more negotiation without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, based on my financial considerations, I am unable to agree to $950,000. I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  $900,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and might not lead to a significantly better price.
* **Time is Money:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale and move on to other opportunities. 

While I could potentially get more from John, the extra $300,000 doesn't outweigh the time and effort involved in potentially continuing to negotiate with Bob."
