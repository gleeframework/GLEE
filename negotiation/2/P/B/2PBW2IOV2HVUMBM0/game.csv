"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $115 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm still sticking with my offer of $115. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer willing to pay that amount. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",115.0,Bob,6,
