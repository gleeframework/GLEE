"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I could do $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me though.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, what do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate you working with me, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My best offer is $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm starting to think we might be getting close to a deal, though. I'll make one more offer: $11,000. This is my last offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
