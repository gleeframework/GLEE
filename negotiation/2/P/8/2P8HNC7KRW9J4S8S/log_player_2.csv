"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($6,500 vs $8,000).  This suggests she's willing to negotiate. It's better to try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's offer and my perceived value. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.  It's also important to remember that John is offering the product for $8,000, so there's still room to negotiate down from my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased by $300 from the first round, but it's still significantly lower than my perceived value.  I'm not in a rush, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, which gives me a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway. My counteroffer reflects this. It's higher than my previous offer but still lower than hers, signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as it's likely closer to her ideal price than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to my perceived value of $8,000, but it's still too high. I'm not yet willing to accept her price, especially since I know I can get the product for $8,000 from John.  By rejecting this offer, I'm showing Alice that I'm committed to getting a better deal, and she's likely to offer something closer to my price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. Alice is now likely feeling the pressure, knowing that she may have to accept my offer or risk losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal.  John's offer is still a viable option, so I have no need to rush into a decision. By rejecting Alice's offer, I can keep the negotiation going and potentially reach a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has increased slightly, and we're getting closer to a potential agreement. I'm increasing my offer to show her that I'm serious about a deal, but still aiming for a lower price.  It's likely that this is close to Alice's bottom line, so there is a good chance she will accept this offer to avoid risking losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my maximum acceptable price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer, saving $600 from John's price. It's worth closing the deal rather than risking a rejection from Alice and then having to buy from John."
