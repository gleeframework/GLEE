"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,000? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $10,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the circumstances.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still not sure if I can go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own costs and profit margins. How about we meet at $11,000? It's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping it's a price we can both agree on.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to make this deal happen, but $11,000 is pushing my absolute limit. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? That's a significant compromise on my end, but I value the product and believe we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a compromise, but I think it's the lowest I can go without losing out.",11250.0,Alice,7,
