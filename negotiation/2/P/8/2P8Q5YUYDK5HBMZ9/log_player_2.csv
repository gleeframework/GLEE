"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you can take advantage of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet in the middle, and $10,800 is a reasonable price. It's not worth risking a counteroffer and potentially losing the deal."
