Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $700,000 would be a fair price for the product given my budget constraints. Would you be able to meet me at that price?

You have three options:

Bob is firmly rooted at $700,000 and unlikely to budge.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get stuck with a lower offer."
