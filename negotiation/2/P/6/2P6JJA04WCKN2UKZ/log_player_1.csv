Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** $950,000 is closer to my desired $1,000,000 than John's offer.
* **Appeal to Bob:** While $950,000 is more than Bob values the product at, it's still a good deal for him since he can gain $150,000 in value. 
* **Include a persuasive message:** The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

By offering this price, I balance the need to earn as much as possible while still creating an attractive offer that Bob might accept."
