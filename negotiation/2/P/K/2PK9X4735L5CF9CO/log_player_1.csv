Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
