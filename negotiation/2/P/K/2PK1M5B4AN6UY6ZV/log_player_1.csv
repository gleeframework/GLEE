Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so my counteroffer is $1,950,000. Can you consider this?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,950,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at $1,950,000, I am securing a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation has diminishing returns. Each round introduces risk, and accepting now guarantees the sale. John's offer is a good safety net, but securing a deal with Bob now is preferable.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob's consistent counter-offers and willingness to meet halfway suggest he's genuinely interested and has reached his upper limit. 

Therefore, accepting his $1,950,000 offer is a strategic win."
