"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly appealing, I'm confident this product's true value is higher. Would you consider $2,100,000? This allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $2,000,000? This represents a significant price point for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain from the product.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to propose a deal where I pay $1,900,000 and you include some additional features or support that I've been wanting. This would make the product more valuable to me and make the deal more worthwhile.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the desire for additional features, but those come at a cost that would need to be reflected in the price. If you're willing to meet me at $1,950,000, I'm happy to close the deal today.  This seems like a fair compromise to ensure we both walk away satisfied.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product, and I'd like to reiterate my interest in the additional features or support. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront. $1,900,000 is my absolute lowest price for the product as is.  At this point, it's really a take-it-or-leave-it situation.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,9,
