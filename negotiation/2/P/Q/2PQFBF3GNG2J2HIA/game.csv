"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on a price that's closer to the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,800? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 just isn't working for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,900.  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price points.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get the product, but I need to stay within my means.",10750.0,Bob,6,
