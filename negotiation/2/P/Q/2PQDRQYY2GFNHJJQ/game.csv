"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105? It's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget better.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $108. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
