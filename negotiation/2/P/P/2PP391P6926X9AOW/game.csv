"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to deliver significant returns.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This represents a substantial opportunity for you while still ensuring a fair return for me.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given its potential, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would still allow you a significant profit while leaving me room to achieve my desired return.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This would still give you a substantial profit margin while allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to a price that works for me.  $925,000 feels more reasonable given the value I see in this product.  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
