"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is at that limit, it makes sense to reject the offer.  There's potential to get a lower price by negotiating.  There's no advantage to buying from John at this point, as Alice has offered the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice wants to close the deal. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is a significant reduction from her initial price and a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially increasing the price. Buying from John at $15,000 is a worse option than accepting Alice's current offer."
