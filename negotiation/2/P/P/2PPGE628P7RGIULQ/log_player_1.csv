"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'll reject it and see if I can get him to budge a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm offering $1,550,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that with only 5 rounds left, Bob will realize that this might be his last chance to get the product."
