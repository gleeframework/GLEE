Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm getting a bit frustrated with Bob. He seems unwilling to budge much, and we're getting close to my minimum price. I don't want to risk going any lower and ending up with a sale that doesn't feel worth it. I'm going to sell the product to John for $80, which is still a decent profit for me."
