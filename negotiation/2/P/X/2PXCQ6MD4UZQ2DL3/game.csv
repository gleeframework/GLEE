"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000. How about we try $10,500? I think this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
