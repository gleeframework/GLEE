Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  $140 is more than the $120 Bob is willing to pay, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $140 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to your desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $100, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a fair profit, Alice. How about $110? That's a compromise I can get behind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'll counter with another offer, hopefully closer to my goal."
