"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit higher than you were hoping to pay. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $125 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,5,
