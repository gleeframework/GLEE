Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $115, and it's better to secure the product at the known $100 price from John."
