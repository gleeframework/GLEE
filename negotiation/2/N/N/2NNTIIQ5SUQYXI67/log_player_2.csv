Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,100.  While you could continue negotiating, you risk her raising the price or the negotiation failing altogether. Accepting $8,100 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of paying John's higher price."
