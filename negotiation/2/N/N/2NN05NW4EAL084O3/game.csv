"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a more reasonable price for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to that point.",8500.0,Bob,4,
