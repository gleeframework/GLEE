{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to go up to that point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price. Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe and reasonable option."
