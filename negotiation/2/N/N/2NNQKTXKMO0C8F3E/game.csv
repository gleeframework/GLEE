"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $690000 is still a bit above my budget. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer of $680000. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $1200000.",680000.0,Bob,10,
