"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we can likely get a better price. Splitting the difference again would put us at $95, but let's see if we can push a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both need to make concessions, Alice. How about $93? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 93
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $96. This would be a win-win for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly aiming for that mid-point. While we might be able to squeeze out a dollar or two more, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $96 is a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
