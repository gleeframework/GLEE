Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act fast. The word ""exclusive"" adds a touch of appeal.
* **Justification of value:** While you don't explicitly state why it's worth this price to Bob, you imply it by saying you ""believe it would be highly valuable to you.""

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects $20,000, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $15,000 safety net with John."
