Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be worth significantly more in the future. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential for appreciation, justifying a higher price.
* **Scarcity:**  Using terms like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique chance"" creates a sense of scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
