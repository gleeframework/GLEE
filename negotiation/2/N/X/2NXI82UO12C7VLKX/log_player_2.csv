"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer and negotiating further."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to stay under $1,000,000. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,150,000? This still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price, but it's still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further by making another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to your desired price point. There's still room for compromise, and you might be able to secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This would be a significant purchase for me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure this deal works for me as well. I'm proposing a final offer of $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than your budget. While it's a significant discount from her original asking price, it doesn't meet your financial goals.  Since you can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, it's a better choice to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
