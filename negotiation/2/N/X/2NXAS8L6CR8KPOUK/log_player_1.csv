Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000 again, as I believe this is the sweet spot for both of us. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

``` 

At this point, Bob has firmly anchored his offer at $1,250,000 and seems unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting this offer secures a $250,000 profit, which is a significant return.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
