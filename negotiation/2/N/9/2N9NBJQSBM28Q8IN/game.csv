"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it, considering the potential for mutually beneficial collaboration. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us if we continue to negotiate.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a more significant movement from your side. I'll offer the product to you for $1,250,000, which is a 5% discount from my initial offer. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway this time.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your latest offer, $1,250,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product, which represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to get any closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. I'll offer the product to you for $1,300,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your price, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my comfortable range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a strong commitment from you. I'll offer the product to you for $1,280,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1280000.0,Alice,9,
