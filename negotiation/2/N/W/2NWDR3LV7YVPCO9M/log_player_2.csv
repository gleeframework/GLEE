You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $175?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $125, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $155.  Since you can get the product for $150 from John, it's better to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
