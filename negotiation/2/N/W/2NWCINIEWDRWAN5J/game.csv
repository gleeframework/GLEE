"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it at a price of $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $7000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8500?  I believe this price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to my desired range.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8000.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8000.0,Bob,4,
