Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it at a price of $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price to see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  I believe this price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to my desired range.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8000.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally prefer a slightly higher price, $8,000 is my minimum threshold and it's a solid deal.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that could potentially result in a lower price."
