"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Can you meet me in the middle?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. I can do $175, which is a bit higher than your initial offer, but still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $155 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and $155. How about $167? It's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception for you.",167.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $160 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",160.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $165? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",165.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $165 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $155 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $120",155.0,Bob,8,
