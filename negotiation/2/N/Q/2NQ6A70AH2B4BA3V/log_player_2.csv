# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a better price than John's $150, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $125.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $125, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $127.5. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $127.5 is a good compromise. It's within my budget of $150 and closer to my desired price of $125. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $150."
