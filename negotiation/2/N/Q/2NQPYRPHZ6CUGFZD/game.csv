"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I was really hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer who is willing to pay more.  I'm hoping you'll consider this offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm going to stick with my original price of $14,000, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'm not willing to budge on this one.",14000.0,Alice,7,
