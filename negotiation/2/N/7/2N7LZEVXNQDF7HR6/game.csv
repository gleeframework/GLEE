"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable solution. Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $885,000.  This offer is a great compromise, and allows us both to be satisfied with the outcome. Let's close this deal now.",885000.0,Alice,5,
