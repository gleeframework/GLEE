It's time to accept Alice's offer.  We're unlikely to get a better deal at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The negotiation is stalling out, with Alice only moving $2,500 in her last counter. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're down to the last couple of rounds. If we reject this and don't reach a deal, we'll be forced to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Savings:**  $1,007,500 is still a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
