Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is worth less than $12000 to me. How about we aim for $9000? I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price point.  $9,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer for $10,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm still making a profit. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
