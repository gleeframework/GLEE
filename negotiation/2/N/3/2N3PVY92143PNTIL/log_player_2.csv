"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have some room to negotiate since she values the product at $1,000,000 and you're willing to pay up to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within your budget and might be acceptable to her, considering she's willing to sell for lower than $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $880,000 is close to your upper limit of $800,000, but it's still a good deal considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to her.  Accepting this offer will save you from further negotiation and ensures you get the product without risking a breakdown in the negotiations."
