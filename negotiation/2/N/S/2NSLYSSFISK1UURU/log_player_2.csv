"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's offer is higher than her perceived value of the product, it's still $100,000 cheaper than buying from John.
* **You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000:** This means any price lower than that is beneficial to you.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
