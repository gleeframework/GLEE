Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I know you'll find it valuable, so I think this is a fair offer. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 200

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher price. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just emphasizing value, can make it more palatable to the buyer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at your minimum price ($150) gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $150, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher offer carries the risk of Bob rejecting it outright. You need to weigh this risk against the potential reward."
