"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but it's a bit higher than I can comfortably afford at the moment.  Given the value we've discussed, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer. I believe this price is fair considering the potential value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
