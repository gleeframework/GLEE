Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000 as a final offer.

If you decline, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
