"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it shows he's willing to negotiate and might be willing to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Create urgency:** By starting with a lower offer, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation but also that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach an agreement. This might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000, so I have room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I'm confident that I can potentially get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $980,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more than $950,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.

Here's my thought process:

* **Close the gap:** I want to bridge the gap between our current positions while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Maintain pressure:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, and I'm not just passively accepting his offers.
* **Balanced approach:** This counteroffer is a middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful deal without resorting to selling to John immediately.

By continuing the negotiation, I'm hoping to secure a higher price for the product without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $960,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can squeeze a bit more out of him, especially with the knowledge that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. 

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Not my minimum:** I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, and $960,000 is still too far off.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're both willing to compromise, so there's room for further movement.
* **Avoiding regret:** Accepting now might lead to regret later, thinking I could have gotten a better deal.

By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the option of selling to John as a strong backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $970,000 as my counteroffer. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still keeping the price closer to my desired range. Here's why:

* **Incremental approach:**  I'm aiming for a gradual, yet steady increase in the price. It shows flexibility without being too aggressive.
* **Maintaining control:** I'm not going to be pressured into a quick decision, but I am showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly willing to go higher or if he's trying to close the deal at a lower price. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving me valuable information to make a more informed decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $965,000 is closer to my target than previous offers, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and keep pushing for a better price.

* **Not yet at my minimum:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, and $965,000 is not acceptable yet.
* **Potential for better:**  The negotiation has been moving in my favor, and I believe there's still potential to increase the offer.
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting now would mean forgoing the chance to potentially get a better deal in the remaining rounds.

By rejecting, I retain control and maintain the option of selling to John if I can't secure a more favorable price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $975,000.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm aiming to close the gap while also showing Bob I'm not willing to concede too much.

* **Showing commitment:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my resolve to get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Pressure to close:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I'm putting pressure on him to decide quickly before the deal potentially falls apart. 
* **Weighing the options:** I need to consider if the potential increase in price justifies the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between achieving a higher price and securing a deal within the limited time frame."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $970,000 is very close to my last counteroffer, and is a decent amount of money, I'm still going to reject it. Here's why:

* **Two rounds left:** I have a limited number of rounds left, but I believe there's still room for improvement.
* **Small gains:**  The difference between $970,000 and $975,000 is relatively small, but it's worth fighting for, considering the significant value of the product to me.
* **Potential for compromise:** Bob's offer indicates he's willing to go higher, so I'm hoping to push for a slight increase in the next round. 

By rejecting this offer, I'm aiming to secure a slightly higher price while still keeping the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 972500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $972,500. With only one round left, I need to make a final push to get closer to my target price without risking losing Bob.

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial desired price.
* **Motivating Bob:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway and potentially secure a deal.
* **Strategic Decision:** If this offer is rejected, I can still fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000. However, I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer due to the limited time remaining. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to maximize my earnings within the constraints of the limited negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and I'm left with a difficult decision. Bob's offer of $970,000 is close to my desired price, but it's still lower than my minimum of $1,200,000. 

I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I might have been able to get a slightly higher price if I had continued negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. 

Here's why:

* **Time constraint:** This is the final round. I can't continue the negotiation process.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum desired price.
* **No room for error:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement, leaving me with no buyer.

This decision balances the potential for a slightly higher price with the certainty of a guaranteed deal at my minimum desired price."
