"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! While I agree this product has potential, your initial offer is a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price and reflects my genuine interest."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I believe the product's value is higher. Considering your willingness to pay $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $800,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, there's still a gap between our valuations.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering your limit, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $750,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While we could try to negotiate further, $750,000 is a good price and significantly lower than both our maximum budget and John's offer.  It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a smaller concession."
