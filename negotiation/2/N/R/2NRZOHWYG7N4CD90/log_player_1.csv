"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is essential, even with the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates a willingness to find a price that works for both parties. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial high price, it's a fantastic outcome.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
3. **Control the Negotiation:**  By starting high, I set the initial bargaining framework."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table.  I'll aim to counter in a way that keeps Bob engaged while moving towards a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The offer of $1,400,000 is a classic negotiation tactic, creating a sense of compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming significantly above Bob's initial offer, preserving the potential for profit.
* **Positive Language:**  The message uses positive language (""appreciate,"" ""fair deal"") to foster goodwill.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Entice Bob:** The price reduction might be enough to sway him, especially with the perception of compromise.
2. **Maintain Bargaining Power:** I'm not dropping to his price immediately, showing I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
3. **Progress the Negotiation:** This keeps the conversation moving forward with a clear target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate, steadily increasing his offer. While $1,300,000 is getting closer to a desirable outcome, I believe I can still secure a better price with a few more rounds. The risk of losing the deal to John at this stage isn't significant enough to warrant accepting Bob's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground. While your offer is attractive, I'm still hoping to reach a slightly higher number. How about we settle at $1,350,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concession:**  I'm lowering my price by a smaller amount ($50,000) than in the previous round, signaling that I'm reaching the upper limit of what I'm willing to concede.
* **Final Offer Tactic (Soft):**  While not explicitly stating it's my final offer, the tone and smaller concession imply that I'm getting close to my bottom line.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Continuing to emphasize the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message maintains a collaborative tone, aiming for a win-win outcome.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Favorable Price:**  $1,350,000 represents a strong profit margin while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.
2. **Gauge Bob's Flexibility:**  His response will reveal if he's willing to move closer to my price or if he's reached his limit.
3. **Maintain Momentum:**  The counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to reach a higher number, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  This price still represents a $100,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price and a significant gain.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his upper limit, and further negotiation might lead to an impasse. 
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the profit and avoids prolonged uncertainty. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and accepting John's offer, which would only net me an additional $100,000, is not worth it. A $1,300,000 sale is a successful outcome in this scenario."
