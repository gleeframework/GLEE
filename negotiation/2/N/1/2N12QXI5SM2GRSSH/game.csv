"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a good compromise. This allows us both to save some money while ensuring I get the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
