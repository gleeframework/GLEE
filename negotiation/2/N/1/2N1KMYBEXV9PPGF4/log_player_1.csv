Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation.  
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating why the price is so high, using language like ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" implies there's something special about the product justifying the markup.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This strategy involves the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. However, with John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $800,000, Alice is not at risk of losing money.
* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  We don't know anything about Bob's personality. If Alice has reason to believe he's a tough negotiator or easily offended by high initial offers, she might adjust her strategy accordingly."
