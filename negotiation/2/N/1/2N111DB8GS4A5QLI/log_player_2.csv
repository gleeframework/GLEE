"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is higher than her perceived value of the product ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. While I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, I can certainly try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think that price is a little high. How about we start at $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation while still being a price that, if accepted, would be a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice moved from her initial offer, $900,000 is still significantly higher than her perceived value and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far off on the price. Could you do $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a price closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's current price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While I might be able to push her slightly lower, the difference at this point is likely to be minimal. Accepting $850,000 secures a reasonable price significantly below my maximum and avoids the risk of missing out entirely by pushing too hard."
