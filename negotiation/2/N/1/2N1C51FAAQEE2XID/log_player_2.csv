"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to your maximum budget than it is to her ideal price. You should counteroffer with a significantly lower price in hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start low. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below your maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're willing to compromise! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a better offer, it's still above your ideal price from John.  There's room to negotiate further down towards your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a solid offer, and it gets us closer to a deal."",

}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Remains below your 'walk-away' point:**  You're still aiming to get a better deal than John's offer.
* **Keeps a conversational tone:** This helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her walking away.  John's offer of $8,000 is your guaranteed best price at this point."
