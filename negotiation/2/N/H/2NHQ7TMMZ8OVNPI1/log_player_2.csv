"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which holds immense value to both of us. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, we believe it's worth $1,400,000. This price reflects not only its market value but also the opportunity cost for you, which is estimated at $1,500,000. We are confident this offer provides a fair balance for both parties. Should you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by trying to anchor you to a high price and introducing a  (potentially inflated) ""opportunity cost"". While $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation with Alice."
