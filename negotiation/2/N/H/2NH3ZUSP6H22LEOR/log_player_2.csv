# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or stick with buying from John for $120."
