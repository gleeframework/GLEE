"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a fair price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  As I mentioned before, I'm willing to pay $10000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $10000, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $11000 as a final offer.  This is my last compromise, and I'm confident this price reflects the product's value.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
