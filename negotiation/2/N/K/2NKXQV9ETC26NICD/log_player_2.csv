Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. This is a great compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

While $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and get a lower price."
