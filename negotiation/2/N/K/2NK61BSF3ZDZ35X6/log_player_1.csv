Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a much higher final price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high initial price, even if those benefits are not explicitly stated.  
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and price sensitivity, giving you valuable information for the next round of negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  I'm starting very high here. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down significantly, especially since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump from our initial ask. While closer to his perceived value, it's still a substantial profit margin for us.  We'll counter-offer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're showing flexibility by moving from our initial price while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering $15,000 positions us directly between our initial ask and Bob's counter-offer, suggesting a spirit of compromise.
* **Stronger Position:** We're still significantly above our minimum ($10,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $13,500 is a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the time and effort involved in further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always the risk Bob walks away if we push too hard. Accepting now secures a good deal."
