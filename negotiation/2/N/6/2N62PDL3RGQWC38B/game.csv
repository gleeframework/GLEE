"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
