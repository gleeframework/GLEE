"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,250 just yet. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I know you mentioned earlier that was your maximum, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $9,750. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
