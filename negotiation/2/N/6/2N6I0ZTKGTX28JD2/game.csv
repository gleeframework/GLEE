"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000.  This product is valuable, but I believe that price reflects its worth to me while still allowing you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to meet you halfway. This still allows you to make a significant profit while ensuring I get a fair price.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1250000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
