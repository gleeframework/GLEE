"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a much larger profit than just the $800,000 John is offering.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:**  By starting high, you leave yourself room to negotiate down if necessary.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$1,000,000 is still a good deal for you.** You're making a profit of $200,000, which is significantly better than selling to John. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** Bob is already offering a price that's closer to your desired outcome. You can potentially get a better deal if you counteroffer. 
* **You have 8 rounds left.** There's still time to see if you can close a deal with Bob at a higher price.

Let's counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This shows good faith and willingness to compromise, making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Still a good profit:** $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum and a good profit for you.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still go lower if necessary, but this offers a strong starting point for this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$950,000 is still a good deal for you.** It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and you're still making a profit.
* **There's room to negotiate.** Bob is still willing to pay a significant amount, and you can potentially push for a higher price.
* **You have 6 rounds left.** There's still time to see if you can close a deal with Bob at a better price.

We'll counteroffer and try to reach a price that's more favorable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Still a good profit:** $1,050,000 is still a substantial profit for you, significantly more than John's offer.
* **Leaving room for a final push:** If Bob rejects, you can still go down slightly, but this counteroffer offers a strong negotiating point for this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still a good deal for you.** It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and you're still making a profit.
* **There's room to negotiate.** Bob is still willing to pay a significant amount, and you can potentially push for a higher price.
* **You have 4 rounds left.**  There's still time to see if you can close a deal with Bob at a better price.  

Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation, we'll need to be more strategic with our counteroffer to ensure a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do.  I hope you'll accept it.  If not, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Stating this is your ""final offer"" adds pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Slight compromise:**  This offer is still a good profit for you, but it shows you're willing to be flexible.
* **Threat of alternatives:**  Mentioning other options (John) reminds Bob that you have options and he needs to be reasonable.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's time to get serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is the best price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product. If we can't meet on this price, I may need to explore other options, including buying from a competitor. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to our last two rounds. 
* **Bob's offer is getting too low:** While $850,000 is still more than what John is offering, it's getting dangerously close to our minimum and doesn't reflect the value we believe the product has.
* **We can potentially push for a better price:**  Even though Bob is threatening to walk away, we have leverage with John's offer as a backup. There's still a chance to get a more acceptable price in the final round.

We need to counteroffer one last time and try to secure a deal that is more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  While I can't go lower than $925,000,  I'm willing to accept that as a final offer.  We've both been flexible, and this price allows for a successful deal for both of us.  It's a good price for you, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let me know what you decide, as I'll be moving on to other options if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is our last counteroffer. We're making a slight concession, but it still gives us a decent profit.
* **Pressure:** We're reminding Bob that we have alternatives (John) and that time is running out.
* **Flexibility:**  We're showing we're willing to compromise, but also being firm on our minimum acceptable price.

Let's see if we can finally close this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the best price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product. If we can't meet on this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is our minimum:** This is the same price John is offering. We're not getting any additional profit by negotiating further.
* **Time is up:** This is the last round of negotiation. We've exhausted all our options with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is the best option:** We're guaranteed a sale at our minimum acceptable price, ensuring we don't lose out on any profit.

It's better to take the guaranteed sale from John rather than risk getting nothing from Bob."
