"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,150,000 to start the conversation.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product would bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't let this go for less than $1,010,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,010,000 and $1,000,000, so how about $1,005,000?",1005000.0,Bob,6,
