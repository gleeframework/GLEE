Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $125 is a good price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
