Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is less than the $1,500,000 Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately pushing Bob to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also not in a rush to sell, as I have a backup option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  By dropping the price to $1,300,000, I show flexibility while still remaining above my minimum and closer to my desired price. 
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** The message focuses on finding a solution that benefits both of us, encouraging Bob to consider a compromise.
* **Set a clear target:**  Stating a specific desired price makes the counteroffer concrete and provides a clear starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over his initial offer and is only $100,000 away from my desired price.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, potentially leading to a lower offer from John.
* **Reasonable profit:**  $1,200,000 is a solid profit and above my minimum of $1,000,000.  

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice at this point, ensuring a profitable sale and minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
