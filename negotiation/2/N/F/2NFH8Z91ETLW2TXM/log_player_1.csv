Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  At $12,000, the deal is still a win for Bob, giving him $2,000 in perceived value. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn more while still being above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a clear starting point:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this aligns more closely with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's guaranteed, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob, potentially earning more than $10,000. There's a chance he might increase his offer after I reject his current one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a proposal of $10,500 for the product. This allows for a fair deal for both parties while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $10,500. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's a guaranteed sale.  I'm confident that selling to John for $15,000 is possible, but there's no guarantee.  By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale and minimize the risk of losing a sale entirely."
