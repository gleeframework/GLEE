Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a tricky situation. Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price, but I could also sell to John for the same amount. However, since there are still 6 rounds left, there's a chance I could get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. However, there is no guarantee that will happen. Considering the risk involved, I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and ensure I get at least $100 for the product."
