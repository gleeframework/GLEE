"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,500. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,500 is far above his budget. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product but I can't go above $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that offer is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $12,000 is a better offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
