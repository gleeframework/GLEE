Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Exceed Bob's Value:** While Bob values it at $12,000, the offer is presented as a significant discount compared to your ""guaranteed"" sale price to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a good price and not losing out on the potential profit from John."
