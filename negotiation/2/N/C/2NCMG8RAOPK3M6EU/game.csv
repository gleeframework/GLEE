"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable for my business, the price point you've presented is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,100,000. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be frank, I could go as high as $1,150,000, but that's really the limit for me.  I understand this might not be ideal, so I'll leave the decision in your hands.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is just $50,000 above your maximum offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
