You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product to you.

You can still get a better deal than $100. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more."
