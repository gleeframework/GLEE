"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $12000 is a good one, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
