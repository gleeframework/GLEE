Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth.  I could come down to $17,000. I'm confident it'll prove valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too steep for me.  How about $7,000?  That's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and settle for $12,000? It's a very generous offer considering its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000.  That's a strong offer on my end."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to make this work, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  Let's settle this right now - $10,500 and it's yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, the negotiations are progressing too slowly.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get the price down to a comfortable level before we run out of rounds. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the most we're willing to pay. It makes the most sense to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
