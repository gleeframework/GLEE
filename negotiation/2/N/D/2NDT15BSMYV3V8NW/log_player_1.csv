Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum acceptable value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value for Bob, not just my needs.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **John as safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to push for a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000 and even below my initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better price:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as leverage:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving in entirely. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to help justify the price. 
* **Positive and assertive:**  I'm using language that is confident but not aggressive. I want to encourage Bob to accept the deal.
* **John is still my backup:** I have the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer."
