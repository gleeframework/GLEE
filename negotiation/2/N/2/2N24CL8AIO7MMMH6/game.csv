"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
