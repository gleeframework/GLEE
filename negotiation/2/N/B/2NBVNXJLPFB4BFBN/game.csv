"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,500 is cutting it too close.  Could you do $9,000? This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
