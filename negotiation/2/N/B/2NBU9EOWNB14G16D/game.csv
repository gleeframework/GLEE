"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value to you is $12,000.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a bit more than $10,750 to make it worth my while. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is still a good deal considering the value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
