"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $17,500. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $16,000? It's closer to my budget and hopefully still a good deal for you.",16000.0,Bob,4,
