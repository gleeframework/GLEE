"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000).  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the significant value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can likely negotiate a lower price, as she's already demonstrated a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and hopefully reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This offer is a compromise that shows my sincere interest in the product, and I believe it allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings and provides a reasonable profit for both of us. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.
