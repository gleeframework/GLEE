"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the returns will be well worth it.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
