"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $65 for it.  Let me know what you think.",65.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $80? This would give us both a good deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
