"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, starting by rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You have no information on the product's true value to Alice, so there's a possibility you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the potential benefits, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  A $300,000 reduction is substantial and shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Considering the potential benefits..."" acknowledges the value while pushing for a lower price.
* **Open to Compromise:** ""Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us"" indicates a willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** Alice has dropped her price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a meaningful reduction.
* **Reaching a Compromise:** The $1,050,000 price represents a midpoint between your offer and her original price, suggesting a potential meeting of the minds.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to compromise and the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer guarantees you the product for a price within your budget."
