"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the potential benefits, I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
