"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $9,500. I believe this product will be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price for its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's $10,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.**  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and Bob could end up paying John's price or losing the deal altogether. 
* **Accepting the offer is the safest choice.** It secures the product at a reasonable price without unnecessary risk."
