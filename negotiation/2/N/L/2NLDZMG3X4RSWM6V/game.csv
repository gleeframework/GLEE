"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective budgets. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, selling for anything less than $1,200,000 is a significant sacrifice for me. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, which is my final offer.  This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I want to make this deal happen. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a compromise that allows us both to gain something from this transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm sticking to my previous price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer, reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
