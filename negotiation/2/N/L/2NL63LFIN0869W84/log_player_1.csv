# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1500000 for it. I understand if this price range doesn't align with your current expectations, but I wanted to express my interest in the product at a price that fits within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
