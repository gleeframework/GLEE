"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1500000 for it. I understand if this price range doesn't align with your current expectations, but I wanted to express my interest in the product at a price that fits within my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is a significant amount, it falls short of my current expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to facilitate this deal. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
