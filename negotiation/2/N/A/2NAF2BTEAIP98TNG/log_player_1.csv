Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more than my baseline value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum value. I'm hoping to get more for the product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from further negotiation. It's better to secure a sale at a price I'm comfortable with than risk getting nothing at all."
