"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still leaving me with a profit far above my minimum. It's important to remember that we only have 10 rounds, and I need to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can push him a little higher.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to keep in mind that I only have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway.  If he rejects again, I'll need to decide how far I'm willing to go to close this deal.  We're already halfway through the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept it. However, I can't afford to be too stubborn either. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I need to be careful and keep in mind that I only have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,600,000.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price.  We are now in the second half of our negotiation rounds, and I need to get this deal done.  I'm not sure how much lower I can go without taking a big hit on my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now well below my minimum. We only have 4 rounds left, and I don't think I can get him to budge much higher. It's better to take John's offer of $1,500,000. This ensures I still get a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing even more money by continuing to negotiate."
