"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is cutting it too close. I could go down to $8,200, but that's my final offer.  This product is worth every penny!",8200.0,Alice,5,
