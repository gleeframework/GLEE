"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. This product is quite interesting to me, but your asking price is a little high. Would you consider a lower price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in this product, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $975,000? I feel this is a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $75,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a compromise that should meet both of our needs, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,
