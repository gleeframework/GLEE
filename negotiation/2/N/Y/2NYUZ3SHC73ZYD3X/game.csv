,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I can't go any lower than $94.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping you'll see it my way and we can finalize this deal.",94.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $80",92.0,Bob,6,
