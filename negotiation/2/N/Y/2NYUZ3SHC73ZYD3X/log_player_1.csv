{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a good amount. I'll see how Bob responds before making further decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $95. I'm going to try to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I can't go any lower than $94.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping you'll see it my way and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $80 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he is unwilling to go above $92. While that's a decent price, it's still below my ideal price point. John is offering a much better deal, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, who might not even end up purchasing the product.  Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point."
