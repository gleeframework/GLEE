"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a fair price given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $150.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? This is a great price for the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still slightly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Since he's already rejected a higher offer, there's no reason to give in now. There's still room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 150}
