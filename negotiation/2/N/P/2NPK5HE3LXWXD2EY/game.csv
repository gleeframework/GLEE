,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? This is a great price for the quality of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",150.0,Bob,4,
