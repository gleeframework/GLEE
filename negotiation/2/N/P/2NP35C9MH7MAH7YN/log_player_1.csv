"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This sets a strong baseline and allows room for negotiation. It's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, so I'm willing to negotiate down from this initial offer.  

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price.  I have 10 rounds total and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a slightly higher price. We have 6 rounds left and I'm not willing to sell for less than $850,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000 again. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial offer, and hopefully, he'll realize it's in his best interest to close the deal.  We have 5 rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, but I'm running out of time.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my counteroffer and losing out on a guaranteed sale.  I'm going to sell to John for $800,000 and secure the deal."
