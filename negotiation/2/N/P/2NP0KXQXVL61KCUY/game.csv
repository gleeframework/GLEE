"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $650,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to meet you exactly in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. To be honest, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",825000.0,Alice,7,
