"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above that.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this to be worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this deal work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $1,125,000. Can you consider that?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
