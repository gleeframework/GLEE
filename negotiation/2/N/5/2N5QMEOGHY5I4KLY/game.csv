"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product!",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think you'll really love the product at this price!",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $16500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to pay $16500, I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. This way, you'll get the product and a valuable bonus. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",16500.0,Alice,7,
