"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and allows me to earn a healthy profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This would still give you a substantial profit while ensuring a significant savings for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing $900,000 for the product. This still leaves you with a significant savings compared to its true value, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John and leaves Bob with a decent savings.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
