"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at $9,500. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? This is still a great deal for you and would allow me to proceed with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
