"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? This is still a great deal for you and would allow me to proceed with the sale.",9000.0,Alice,3,
