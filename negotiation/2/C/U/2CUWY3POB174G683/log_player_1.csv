Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $100. This is a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, highlighting the potential value to Bob.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances my desire for a good price with the risk of losing the deal. By offering a price below my minimum acceptable price, I increase the chance of Bob accepting. However, the price is still high enough that I can earn a profit and avoid selling to John for the minimum price."
