"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $600,000 is a significant reduction from your initial offer.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Alice,5,
