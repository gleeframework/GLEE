Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to pay a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than my initial offer, but it's also closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping that he'll see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
