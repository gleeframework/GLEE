Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it implies that there are additional benefits or value propositions not yet discussed. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and open to discussion,  inviting Bob to counter-offer.

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price accordingly. The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring a successful sale."
