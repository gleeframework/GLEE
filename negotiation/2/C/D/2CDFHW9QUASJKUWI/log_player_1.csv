Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Value Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its high value and potential demand, aiming to justify the price to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this initial offer. However, it positions you strongly for further negotiation or allows you to move on to John with no loss."
