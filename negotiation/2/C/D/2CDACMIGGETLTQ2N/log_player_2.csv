"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, so this is a fair price for both of us. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You can reject Alice's offer and still purchase the product from John, albeit at a slightly higher price."
