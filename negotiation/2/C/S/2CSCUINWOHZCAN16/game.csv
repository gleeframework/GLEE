"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but I can't accept $850,000.  The product's value is quite significant, and I'm confident it can bring you even greater returns. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
