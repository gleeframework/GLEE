"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk losing the deal entirely."
