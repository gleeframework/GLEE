"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and slightly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value, setting a confident tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By referring to it as a ""starting point,"" we signal our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the negotiation moving towards a favorable outcome for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this item, my budget allows me to spend up to $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, indicating strong interest in the product. However, it's still substantially below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap.  Selling to John right now would meet our minimum, but we might be able to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $950,000 falls short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** We've come down from our initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out numbers; we're framing the price reduction as meeting in the middle and acknowledging Bob's interest, making it feel like a fair compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $1,050,000 price point provides a significant buffer above our minimum ($1,200,000) and John's offer, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe that $950,000 was a fair price based on my budget. I am willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increment of $25,000 is relatively small. This could indicate that he's reaching his maximum budget, but it's still too far from our desired price. We'll hold firm and see if we can encourage him to move closer to our $1,050,000 counteroffer. We're still comfortable walking away and selling to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is firmly above $975,000.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Bob's effort while standing firm on the product's value. This reinforces that we're not going to drastically reduce the price.
* **Smaller Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) compared to the previous one ($50,000). This signals that we're getting closer to our limit and Bob needs to make a more substantial move to reach a deal.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** By framing this offer as a significant compromise, we highlight our willingness to make a deal but only at the right price. This keeps the door open for negotiation while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I respect your position on the value of the product. I am willing to go up to $990,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is increasing, but very slowly.  He's still $35,000 away from our last counteroffer, and time is starting to become a factor.  We need to signal that we're serious about our price and encourage him to make a more substantial jump.  We're willing to risk losing the deal to secure a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but we need to be realistic.  The value of this product is substantial, and I'm simply not willing to go below $1,010,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what this product brings to the table. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  We're taking a firm stance by presenting this as our ""final offer."" This injects urgency into the negotiation and signals that we're serious about our price.
* **Slight Concession:** While firm, we are still offering a small concession to demonstrate some flexibility and encourage Bob to respond.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake if he doesn't meet our price. 
* **Call to Action:** We end with a clear call to action, prompting Bob to make a decision and potentially close the deal. 

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and it's time for Bob to show his hand. This approach balances firmness with a final opportunity for Bob to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer carefully. I am willing to pay $995,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is barely budging, only increasing by $5,000.  This indicates that he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Holding out for another round or two at this point presents a significant risk:

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Bob might be trying to run down the clock, hoping we'll cave to a lower price out of desperation as we get closer to the deadline. 
* **Limited Upside:** Even if Bob does increase his offer slightly, it's unlikely to be a substantial difference from his current position.

Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk of ending up with a much lower price isn't worth it. It's time to take the guaranteed win and move on."
