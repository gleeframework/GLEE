"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in closing today."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer and close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I've already rejected Bob's offer twice at $9,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, accepting his offer now is the best option to maximize my profit. There is a significant chance that Bob will continue to offer $9,500 in the next round, leaving me with only one round to negotiate. It is possible that he might even lower his offer in the next round.  It's better to accept his offer now and secure a profit of $1,500 rather than risk a lower offer or ending up selling to John for $8,000."
