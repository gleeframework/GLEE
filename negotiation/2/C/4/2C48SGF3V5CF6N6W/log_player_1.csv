Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product and how much he's willing to pay.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee a sale, offering it at $10,000 to Bob initially would be the safer option."
