Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum value of $10,000 but not excessively high.  This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate, but also signals that I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counter-offer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500.  This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum threshold of $10,000.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It seems Bob is firm on his price and I'm unlikely to get much closer to my desired value.  While I'm disappointed, it's better than continuing the negotiation with Bob and possibly ending up with a lower price."
