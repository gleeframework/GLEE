"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I think that's a fair price for the product.",9800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves you a good amount of profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
