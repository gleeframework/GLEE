"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product seems interesting, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $775000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, but I need to make sure I get a bit more for the product. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to stay above $750000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $775000, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $25000. This way, you'll get an even better deal than you initially thought. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
