Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know you have John as a guaranteed buyer. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's higher than your minimum but still attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, going slightly above that might deter him. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $850,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:**  The message is clear and positions the product as valuable.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $850,000 price aims to capture some of the value for you while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **No Mention of John:**  You don't want to reveal your fallback position.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate but don't go below your $800,000 minimum. 
* **Relationship Matters:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If you think he might be a repeat customer, being slightly more flexible could be beneficial in the long run."
