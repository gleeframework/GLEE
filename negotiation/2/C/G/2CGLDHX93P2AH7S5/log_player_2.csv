"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for a product worth much more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  Rejecting allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering your value for the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's still room for negotiation, and he should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low. I'm willing to offer $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a decent deal. Let's finalize this, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Even though Alice is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his limit. It's better to get the product at a lower price from John, even if it means missing out on potentially negotiating a slightly better deal with Alice."
