"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $115 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
