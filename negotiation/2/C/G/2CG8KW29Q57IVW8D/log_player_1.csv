Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $140. This is a good starting point as it's a fair compromise between my minimum value ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
