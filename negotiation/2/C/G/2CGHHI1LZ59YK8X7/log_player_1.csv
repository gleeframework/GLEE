Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
