"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial price to make this worthwhile.  How about $1600000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
