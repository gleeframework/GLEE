Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $950000.  It's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal profitable for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
