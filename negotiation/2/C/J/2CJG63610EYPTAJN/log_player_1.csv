Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below your minimum ($150). This gives him room to negotiate while still giving you a decent profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:**  It emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.

By starting with this offer, I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for a potential negotiation.  If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and John is a guaranteed sale for a much higher price.  Therefore, it's more strategically sound to reject Bob's offer and try to push him closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $100 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $120? This still gives you a great price, and it's a fair compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $120 is halfway between my last offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100).  This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Reinforce the value proposition:**  I emphasize that $120 still offers a good deal for Bob.  This subtly reminds him that the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** A positive and respectful tone helps maintain a good rapport with Bob during the negotiation. 

I believe this counteroffer positions me well for a successful negotiation. Bob might accept, or we could continue negotiating further, but at least I'm moving in the right direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello again, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Could we possibly agree on $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still not enough. I've already shown flexibility and compromised, and at this point, I'm getting a better deal with John. It's not worth risking losing a guaranteed $150 sale to continue negotiating with Bob for a small potential gain. 

Selling to John ensures I get my desired profit and avoid further back-and-forth that might not yield a better outcome."
