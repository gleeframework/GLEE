"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future collaborations. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
