{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will be moving forward with another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting with a higher price ($18,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Anchoring:** The initial high price acts as an anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept it, it sets the stage for a potentially higher counter-offer than if Alice started with a price closer to $12,000.
* **Deadline:**  Creating a sense of urgency encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Subtly mentioning John assures Bob that Alice has other options and isn't desperate to sell.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he makes a counter-offer. The final price will depend on Bob's negotiation skills and how much Alice is willing to compromise."
