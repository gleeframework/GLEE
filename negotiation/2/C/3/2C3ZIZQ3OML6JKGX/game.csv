"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would be a good compromise and allow us to both close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  While $10,750 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,900 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. How about $11,050? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come away satisfied. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",11050.0,Alice,7,
