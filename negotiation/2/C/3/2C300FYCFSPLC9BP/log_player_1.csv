Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. It also gives me a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would ideally get more, $11,500 is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
