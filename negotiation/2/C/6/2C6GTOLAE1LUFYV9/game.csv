"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my current financial situation.  I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to counter your offer with $875,000. This shows a commitment to closing the deal while remaining fair to both parties.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer to a deal.  $890,000 is still a bit out of my range.  To make this happen, I'm willing to go up to $865,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's make this work!",865000.0,Bob,6,
