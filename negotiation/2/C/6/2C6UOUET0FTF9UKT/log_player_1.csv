Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to capitalize on his interest in the product. This will allow room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This should encourage Bob to accept, as it's a better deal for him than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk him walking away or further negotiations dragging on. It's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure the sale."
