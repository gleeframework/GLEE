"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. He's trying to get the best deal possible while still showing interest in the product. This initial counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $13500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room to negotiate.  Bob can likely get the price down further by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing a willingness to compromise. By meeting Alice halfway at $13,250, he's demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product while still trying to save money."
