"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the price, $1,250,000 falls short of the true value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this bridges the gap while still reflecting the product's significance.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is difficult to ignore. I could come down to $1,550,000. This offer takes into account the steps we've both taken in the negotiation.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to accepting your offer.  However, $1,550,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm ready to offer $1,450,000. This shows my commitment to finalizing a deal, but it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
