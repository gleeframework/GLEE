"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, so I'm going to offer it to you for $9,250. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  The offer of $9,250 is a decent compromise, and Bob is likely comfortable with that price.
* **Time is a factor:** Bob only has 10 rounds to negotiate.  Continuing to reject offers risks the deal falling through or forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **The value gap is shrinking:**  Bob can save $750 compared to buying from John, and that's a significant saving.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
