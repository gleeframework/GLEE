# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Let me know if that's more to your liking!"", ""product_price"": 9250}"
