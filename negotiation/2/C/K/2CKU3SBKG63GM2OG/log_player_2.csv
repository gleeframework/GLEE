"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start at $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum value for the product. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm looking for a good deal. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I'm unable to accept $85. How about $90? This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $87.  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of getting the price as close to $85 as possible. By offering $87, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal and I'm willing to meet her halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $88 for the product. This price respects the value we place on it while remaining competitive. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is very close to my ideal price point of $85. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending up paying $100 to John is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price within my budget."
