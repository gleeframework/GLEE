Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's meet in the middle at $105. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's aiming for a much higher price point than your budget allows. Her ""final offer"" of $105 is still significantly more than John's offer of $80. At this point, continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with."
