"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: Alice's offer is higher than our maximum valuation and leaves little room for negotiation. We should counter-offer with a significantly lower price to gauge her willingness to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range for both parties. It leaves room for negotiation while clearly signaling that we're serious about buying at a lower price point.
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This counter-offer will help us understand Alice's flexibility and how eager she is to sell. If she's willing to come down significantly, it suggests we might be able to get a great deal. If she's firm, we'll need to adjust our strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product for $850,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has moved slightly, her offer of $850,000 is still considerably higher than our ideal price and only a small concession from her initial offer.  We need to show Alice that we're serious about a lower price point and willing to walk away if necessary. We'll continue negotiating to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrating Willingness:**  By increasing our offer, we're showing Alice that we are serious about purchasing the product and willing to negotiate in good faith. 
* **Strategic Increment:** The $50,000 increase is substantial enough to signal progress, but not so large that it eliminates our negotiating room. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still significantly below her asking price, keeping the pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value. I'm now offering the product for $820,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is slowly coming down, but $820,000 is still a long way from our target price. We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. It's time to show Alice we're willing to walk away if she doesn't make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still too wide. To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $700,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer lays out our final offer, creating a clear line in the sand. We're still being respectful and acknowledging Alice's position, but we're also being firm about our limitations.
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning our ""other options"" and emphasizing the need to decide ""today,"" we introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** While we've stated our limit, we're leaving the door slightly ajar by not explicitly saying we'll walk away. This gives Alice one last chance to make a deal without feeling completely backed into a corner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've reached your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value. I'm now offering the product for $810,000. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has barely budged in her offer, and with only a few rounds left, it's highly unlikely she will meet our $700,000 limit. Continuing to negotiate at this point risks losing a guaranteed price from John. It's in our best interest to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further and being left with nothing."
