Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll start by offering it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $120}

This way, I'm still making a profit, and Bob might be willing to accept the offer since it's lower than what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to sell the product for, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than what I'm willing to sell it for.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $110}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $95, and I rejected it, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $95. I'll also take into account that the product is worth $100 to Bob, so I'll try to get closer to that price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $105}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $150."
