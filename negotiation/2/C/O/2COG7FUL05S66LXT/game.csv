"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet at $1050000. I would like to make one final offer of $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1020000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product is worth more than what you're offering.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
