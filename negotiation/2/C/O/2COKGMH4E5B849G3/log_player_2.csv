"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, it's still above your ideal price point. You have the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price. You can see if Alice is willing to drop her price further in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal. It also leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $105 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your acceptable range and is closer to your ideal price of $105. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and being forced to buy from John for $120.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
