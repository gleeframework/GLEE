Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm sure this product is great, but I'm only looking to pay up to $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $13000, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13250. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",13250.0,Alice,5,
