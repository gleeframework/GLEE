"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's important to find a fair price for both parties. I propose we start with a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $11,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise while also considering the value the product holds for us as well.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your offer, I propose a price of $11,250 for the product. This offers a slight increase from my previous proposal and maintains a fair balance between our interests.",11250.0,Alice,5,
