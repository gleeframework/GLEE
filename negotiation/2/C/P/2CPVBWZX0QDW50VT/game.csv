,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1100000. This is the best I can do at this time.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I've made significant concessions already, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I need to make one more thing clear: this is the absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Alice,7,
