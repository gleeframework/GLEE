"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm thinking of starting the price at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $100?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a significant counteroffer.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $100 is a substantial discount, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message expresses interest and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:** Alice's offer of $110 is still within Bob's maximum value for the product. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown willingness to compromise, meeting Bob halfway from their initial positions.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially with John as a backup option.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still favorable to Bob."
