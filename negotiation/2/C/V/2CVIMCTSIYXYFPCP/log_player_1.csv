Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even at that price."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I want to start with a strong offer, significantly above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Bob's value is $8,000, and my minimum is $10,000. There's a potential agreement zone in between. By starting high, I'm testing the waters to see how much Bob is willing to pay.
* **Confidence:**  The message implies the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is above his perceived value of $8,000, indicating he's willing to stretch somewhat.
* **Below My Minimum:** However, $9,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $10,000. Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a $1,000 gap between his offer and my minimum. By rejecting and countering, I can try to close that gap or get closer to my desired price. 

**It's important to note:**  While I have John as a backup, I want to exhaust reasonable negotiation with Bob before taking the guaranteed $10,000. There's a chance I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  Bob offered $9,000, and my minimum is $10,000.  By countering at $11,000, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my bottom line.
* **Psychology:**  People often respond well to a sense of fairness. Splitting the difference (though slightly skewed in my favor) can be a persuasive tactic.
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop my price too drastically, as it could make Bob undervalue the product or think I'm desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $9,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is anchored at $9,000 and hasn't budged. This suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $10,000 from John. Time spent haggling with Bob is time I could be finalizing the sale to John.
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  While getting more than $10,000 would be ideal, I've established my minimum and am willing to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet it. 

It's been a good negotiation attempt, but sometimes the best deal is the one you already have. Accepting John's offer makes the most sense now."
