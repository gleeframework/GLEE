"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired value.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making him aware of the potential profit he could make. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully create a good atmosphere for the negotiation.

**Note:** I'm setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value, as he might be willing to pay a premium for the product. This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  
* **I still have 9 rounds left.** There's time to continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John right now would only give me a small profit compared to what I could potentially get from Bob.** 

**Next Round:** I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to maintain a good relationship during negotiations.

**Strategy:** By making a counteroffer closer to my desired price but still offering a compromise, I hope to make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal while also getting closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** This means I'm guaranteed to make a profit.
* **I'm already in Round 4.  **  There's a chance that I could get a slightly higher price, but it's not guaranteed. 
* **The potential for further negotiation is limited.**  Bob has already shown a willingness to come up in price, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of not reaching a deal. While I could potentially try for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential gain."
