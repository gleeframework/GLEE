Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I am serious about getting a good price for my product. 

I am confident that I can get at least $1,500,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in my bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is still a good price for me and closer to Bob's offer.  I believe this shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to come back with a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm confident that I can secure my desired price with John. It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and accept John's offer to avoid further risks and delays."
