"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your value and my willingness to invest.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $975,000.

This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good value for the product.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be mindful of my own minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,015,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.
