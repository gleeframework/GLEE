{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000. There is room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.**  By rejecting, you initiate a negotiation process where you can potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While John is an option, you want to try to get a better deal from Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be mindful of my own minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,015,000.

* **Limited negotiation rounds:** You only have one round left, and rejecting could lead to a deal with John at a much higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Alice has stated that this is her final offer, and rejecting it could mean losing the opportunity to buy the product from her.
