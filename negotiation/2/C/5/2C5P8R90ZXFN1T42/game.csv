"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1800000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this exceptional product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our positions. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1750000 is simply too low for this product. It's significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Let's compromise at $1850000.  This price reflects the unique qualities of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
