"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $10500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $10000. Can we make a deal at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000, as it's worth $12000 to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
