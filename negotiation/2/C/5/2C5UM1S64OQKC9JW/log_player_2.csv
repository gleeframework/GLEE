"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's a good deal. There's no benefit to rejecting her offer and buying from John at the same price."
