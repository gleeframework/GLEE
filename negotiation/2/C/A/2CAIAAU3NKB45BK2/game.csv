"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can exceed your initial expectations in terms of returns. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a significant opportunity.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
