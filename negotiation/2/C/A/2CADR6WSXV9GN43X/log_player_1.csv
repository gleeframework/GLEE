Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need to make at least $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Bob's value:** He values the product at $10,000, so anything over that is a win for him.
* **First offer:**  A price of $14,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than his value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John:**  I have a backup offer from John, which makes me less pressured to accept a low price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll gauge Bob's response to this initial offer. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If negotiations stall, I'll always have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $11,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also too low considering I'm willing to negotiate with him.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can potentially get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's more favorable to me, but still within a range that I believe he might consider. If he rejects again, I'll re-evaluate my options, including selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** While I need at least $15,000, I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing a potential sale to John. 
* **Bob's offer:**  $11,000 is too low, but it indicates he's willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** A price of $12,500 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still more than Bob's offer. It's also a price I believe he might be willing to accept, considering his value for the product is $10,000.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground that benefits both of us. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but am also willing to be flexible. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price while also securing a sale without needing to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $11,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation stall:** Bob's repeated rejections indicate he might not be willing to budge further, and further negotiations could be time-consuming.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering and aligns with my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

At this point, the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer outweighs the potential benefit of continuing negotiations with Bob.  I'll accept John's offer to ensure a quick and profitable sale."
