"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $11,000?

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still aim for a lower price.  He has the option to buy from John for $8,000 if he can't get a better deal from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget. I'm ready to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer on this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice is getting closer to his desired price, $10,000 is still higher than his maximum budget. He's already invested several rounds in negotiation, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  John offers a firm and secure price within Bob's budget."
