I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident in the value of my product and I believe this price is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher return.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that encourages Bob to accept while still earning me a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see any value in continuing to negotiate with him. I've already rejected his offer twice and it seems he's not willing to budge on his price. John is willing to pay the same amount, so I'll sell the product to him to avoid any further delays or potential losses."
