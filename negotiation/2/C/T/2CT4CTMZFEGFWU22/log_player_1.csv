Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 or more, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a good profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We know we have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so we don't want to go lower than that. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome with Bob while having a safety net with John."
