Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price that's attractive, and I get a solid return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000 is a good starting point.**  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit.** This sets a cooperative tone and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
* **This offer allows room for both of us to negotiate.** I am not setting a hard price that might immediately trigger a rejection. 

Remember, I can always go to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1000000 at most. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his initial counteroffer is too far off the mark. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $1,000,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position but firmly stating my minimum price needs to be closer to $1,000,000.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer to $1,050,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that $1,050,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Call to Action:** I'm prompting Bob to meet me halfway by finding a ""middle ground.""

This counteroffer maintains my bargaining power while offering a path towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1025000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000, this deal still offers a good return on my investment.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal without risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation process."
