"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product for $1250000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price that's attractive, and I get a solid return on my investment. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1000000 at most.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $1000000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1050000? It's still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $1000000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1025000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
