"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $95 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's initial offer is a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is $90, which is within your budget of $100 and is closer to your desired price of $85. Accepting her offer is the best option in this situation."
