Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,200,000 as my initial offer. This is above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit.
* **Message:**  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  I emphasize the product's value and highlight that the price is fair. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Start strong:**  My initial offer is aggressive but leaves space for negotiation. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate.
* **Build rapport:** A friendly approach encourages Bob to feel valued and participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and I'm sure we can both benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not desperate and have a backup buyer in John. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000. This price still allows us both to benefit from the deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counter-offer is $1,150,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's position, but also reinforces the value of the product. I emphasize the ""win-win"" potential of the deal to encourage further negotiation.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The phrase ""find a middle ground"" promotes a collaborative tone and suggests that I'm open to further discussions. 

This counter-offer strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm willing to move from my initial offer but not sacrificing too much. 
* **Maintain leverage:** The price is still above Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation in my favor.
* **Promote dialogue:** The message encourages Bob to continue engaging in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Considering that John is willing to buy for $1,500,000, I can afford to accept this offer and secure a deal with Bob. This would result in a profit of $100,000.

While I could continue to negotiate for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely, leaving me with no deal. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
