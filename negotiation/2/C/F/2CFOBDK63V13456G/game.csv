"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and I'm sure we can both benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000. This price still allows us both to benefit from the deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
