"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000.  I believe this price is still a good value for you, considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
