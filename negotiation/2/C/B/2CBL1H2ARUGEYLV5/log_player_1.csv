Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than his perceived value) while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves a good profit margin for you while still saving Bob $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""significant benefits,"" you subtly anchor the price in terms of value rather than just a number. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup offer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important for potential future deals.
