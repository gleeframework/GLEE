"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget considerations, but $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a very competitive price considering the benefits it will bring you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,200? I feel like that's a fair offer.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  However,  $7,200 is still too low.  Let's settle this at $10,000 even. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at that price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
