,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $17,000?  It's a fair offer that reflects the quality of what's on the table.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
