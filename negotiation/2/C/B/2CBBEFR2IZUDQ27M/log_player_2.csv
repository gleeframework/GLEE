"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. The product I am offering is not just any item; it holds immense value and significance to me, reflecting its true worth of $10,000. However, considering its importance to you, I am willing to negotiate a price that suits both our interests. I propose a price of $9,500 for this unique product. This offer allows you to acquire something truly special at a price slightly above its intrinsic value to you, ensuring a fair transaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, so we can proceed with confidence. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for a guaranteed saving."
