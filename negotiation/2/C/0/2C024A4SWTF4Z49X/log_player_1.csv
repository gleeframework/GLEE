Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe it's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to start negotiations high. This leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for your price, even if it's a simple statement about ""value,"" can make the offer feel more reasonable to Bob.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Ending with an open-ended question like ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $19,000 is significantly more than Bob initially valued the product, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as unique or difficult to find elsewhere.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to lower your price or stick to your minimum of $15,000 knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
