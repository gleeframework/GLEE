"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and lower than your maximum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better deal.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses my appreciation for the initial price reduction. It then clearly states my counteroffer and leaves the decision in Alice's hands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,150,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget and significantly lower than my initial maximum price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
