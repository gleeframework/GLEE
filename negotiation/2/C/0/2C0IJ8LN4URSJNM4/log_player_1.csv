"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $12,500 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $13,000 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's time to close the deal."
