"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $15,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,750. That's the best I can do.",10750.0,Bob,6,
