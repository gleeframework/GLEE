{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $112.50 is still higher than your target of $100, but it's getting closer.
* You've already gone back and forth multiple times, and you're likely to hit your limit of how much you're willing to negotiate.
* Buying from John for $150 would be significantly more expensive. 
*  Accepting the offer allows you to get the product at a price that's still reasonable and saves you from further negotiations."
