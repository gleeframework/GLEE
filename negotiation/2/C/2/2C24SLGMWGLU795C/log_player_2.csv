"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both her value and my upper limit. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $130 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100."",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counter-offer that's still significantly below my upper limit but closer to a price Alice might realistically accept.  This leaves me room to negotiate upward while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price I'd consider, but it's still too high.  I'll reject again to signal that I'm looking for a more significant price drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107?"",
 ""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by suggesting the middle ground between our previous offers ($100 and $115).
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is still comfortably below my $150 maximum, leaving space for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Pressure:** Offering a specific number instead of a range can sometimes encourage the other party to respond more concretely."
