Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I have several rounds left, so I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
