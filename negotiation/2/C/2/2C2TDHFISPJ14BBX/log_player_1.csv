Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
