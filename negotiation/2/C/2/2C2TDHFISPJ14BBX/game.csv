"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still a good value for you.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I could do $750,000. It's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer.  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",800000.0,Alice,5,
