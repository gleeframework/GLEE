"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm starting with a price of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be useful, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll gain from this product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
