Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.,950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer of $900000, Bob, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd like to make a new offer of $915000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at this point.",915000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your new offer of $915000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $920000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
