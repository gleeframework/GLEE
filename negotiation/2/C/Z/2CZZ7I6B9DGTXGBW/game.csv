"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product and willing to pay a premium for it. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that the product has value, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,
