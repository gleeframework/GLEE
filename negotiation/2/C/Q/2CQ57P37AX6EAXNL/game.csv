,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's really pushing my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13,000 for the product. This is a good price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion. I'm really trying to make this work. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I can offer you a price of $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
