Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him up a bit more before considering selling to John."

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $9500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still not satisfied with the price, and I think I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round and see if I can convince Bob to pay a little more."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're down to the last few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear he's not going to budge much further.  While I would like to get a higher price from Bob, it's more important for me to get close to my minimum target of $15,000. Selling to John guarantees me that price and provides certainty."
