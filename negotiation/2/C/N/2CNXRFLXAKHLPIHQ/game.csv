"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $13,000 as a compromise. It still stays within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to go up just a little bit to $13,500? This would be a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've considered your proposal, and I'm willing to go up to $13,200. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your efforts, $13,200 still falls short of my expectations. I'm confident we can reach a fair price that satisfies both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,600? It's a small increase, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",13600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still unable to meet you at $13,600. I'm willing to go up to $13,400. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",13400.0,Bob,8,
