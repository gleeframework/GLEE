"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay under $11,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
