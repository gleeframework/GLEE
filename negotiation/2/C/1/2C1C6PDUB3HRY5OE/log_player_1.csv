Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'll counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still holding firm above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll reach a deal.  John's offer is a guaranteed amount that meets my minimum requirement.  I'm going to sell to John."
