{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. What do you think about a price of $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your bottom line ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging interest:** This offer allows you to see how interested Bob is. If he accepts, you've made a great sale. If he rejects outright, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup.
* **Potential for profit:**  This price gives you a potential profit of $40 over Bob's perceived value, which is a significant margin. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly down if Bob negotiates, but don't go below your minimum of $150."
