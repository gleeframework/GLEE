"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000.  I know this product is valuable to you and this is a fair price for something you'll be gaining so much use from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting her initial offer and seeing if she's willing to come down.  You always have the option to buy from John for $15,000 if needed."
