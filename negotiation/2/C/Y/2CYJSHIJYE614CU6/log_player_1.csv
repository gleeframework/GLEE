Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to the guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, should he try to do so.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By emphasizing a limited-time offer and exclusivity, Alice adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and perceive higher value."
