Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're running out of time, and while I'd like to get closer to my desired price, the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is still a significant amount of money."
