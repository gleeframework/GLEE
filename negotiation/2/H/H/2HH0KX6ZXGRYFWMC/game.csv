"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This price is still within your value range, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This offer is still well above my maximum budget and  I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",13500.0,Alice,5,
