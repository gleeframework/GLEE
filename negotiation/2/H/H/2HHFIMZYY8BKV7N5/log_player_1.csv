Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. While I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high, but below Bob's perceived value, allows room for potential negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 (his max) might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could scare him off. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
