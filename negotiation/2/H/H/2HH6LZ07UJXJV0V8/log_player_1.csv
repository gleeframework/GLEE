I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good price for both of us. It's more than my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's less than the value he places on the product ($120).  If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $100, so I have no downside to offering a slightly higher price to Bob."
