Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm looking to save even more.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
