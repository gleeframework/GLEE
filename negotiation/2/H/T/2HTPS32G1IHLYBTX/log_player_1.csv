Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the price at $10,000. This is a significant discount for me, but still leaves me with a profit of $5,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It highlights the potential profit he can make and encourages him to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground.  While I could potentially get $15,000 from John, there's a chance Bob might accept the offer and I could get the product sold quicker.  Additionally, offering a lower price might make Bob more likely to accept, as he's getting a better deal than he initially expected."
