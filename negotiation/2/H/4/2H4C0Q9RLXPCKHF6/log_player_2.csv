"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for $150 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's always worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in your product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm also being polite and expressing interest in the product to maintain a positive relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $137.50? It's a fair price for a unique product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $137.50, which is a reasonable compromise. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will reject further offers, and I'll end up paying $150 to John.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within my budget."
