Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win outcome.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob understands exactly what you're proposing. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a little steep for me, how about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John,  it's still below the value I want to get for the product. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100. How about $95?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you get from the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, and it's still within the range where Bob can get a good deal while I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for closer to $100, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$90 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John, and it's close enough to my initial offer that I'm happy with the deal."
