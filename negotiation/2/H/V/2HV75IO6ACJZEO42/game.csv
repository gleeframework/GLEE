"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident the product's intrinsic worth is significantly higher.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  This reflects its true potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  However, the value of this product is strongly tied to its future potential, which I believe your initial assessment recognized.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,190,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,160,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the negotiations we've had so far.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to be mindful of the product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,175,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and final compromise. ",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
