"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in the following rounds.  I am also keeping in mind the $1,500,000 floor price I have set for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,500,000 is my floor price, I'm not desperate to sell.  Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer. It's above my floor price and it seems like a fair price at this point. I'm choosing to accept this offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
