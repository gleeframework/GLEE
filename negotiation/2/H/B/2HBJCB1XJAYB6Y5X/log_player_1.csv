Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its worth to him.
    * You make a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is framed to invite a counter-offer from Bob while still highlighting the product's value."
