"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, given my budget constraints. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $1500000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least see $1750000 for this to work.  This reflects the value of the product and my need to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000 for this product. This is a fair compromise and will hopefully allow us to finalize this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
