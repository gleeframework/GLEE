Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer, along with the reasoning:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,000,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob won't pay more than $800,000 because that's the product's value to him.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between Alice's minimum and Bob's maximum.  

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA, Alice's best move is to offer a price that Bob will almost certainly reject, knowing she has John as a backup. This allows her to maximize her profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $799,999.  This offer is only valid for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 799999
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Price:** The price is just below Bob's maximum, making it tempting but still highly likely to be rejected.
* **Urgency:** The 24-hour limit adds pressure and might make Bob act impulsively. 
* **Exclusivity:** Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.

**Outcome**

* **Bob Rejects:** The most likely scenario. Alice sells to John for $1,000,000.
* **Bob Accepts (Highly Unlikely):**  While improbable, if Bob accepts, Alice still gets a price very close to her minimum. 

**Important:** Alice needs to be prepared for Bob's rejection and ready to finalize the deal with John."
