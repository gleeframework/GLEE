"Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating at that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my best counteroffer so far. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
