"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It makes no sense to accept it. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating at that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my best counteroffer so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first offer, it's still too high. I'm willing to pay no more than $10,000. I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but she's still unwilling to meet my price.  I've already made my maximum offer, and there's not much room for further negotiation.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $10,000.  I can get the product I need without further haggling and save myself time and effort."
