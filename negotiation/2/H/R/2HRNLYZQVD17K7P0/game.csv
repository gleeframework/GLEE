"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,500,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the market value. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is closer to your own valuation and would make this a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product and the market value. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
