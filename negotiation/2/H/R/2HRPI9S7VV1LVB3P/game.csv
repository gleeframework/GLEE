"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly significant, and $950,000 is considerably below what I believe is fair.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
