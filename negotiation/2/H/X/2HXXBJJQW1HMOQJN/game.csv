"Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11500 is closer, I'm still a bit outside of my budget. I'm happy to offer $9500 for the product.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
