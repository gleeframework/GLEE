"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $12,500. This is my best offer so far, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $12,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting closer to the price I'm looking for, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $11,500 just yet. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $12,000, but only if you're willing to throw in some extras, such as a 2-year warranty and a personalized setup session. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras offer, but I'm still not at $12,000.  I'm willing to meet you at $11,800.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  What do you say?",11800.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I understand you want to make sure this is a good long-term relationship, but I'm focused on getting the best deal for this product right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,900 for the product, no strings attached.  Let's close this deal now. What do you say?",11900.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're getting very close to the price I'm looking for, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $12,500, but I'll throw in a free maintenance checkup for the next 6 months. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal now. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,9,
