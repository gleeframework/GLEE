"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price takes into account the unique and significant potential this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable adjustment, and I believe it reflects my eagerness to work with you while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. To be frank, I'm looking at a maximum of $700,000 for this product.  If we can find an agreement closer to that number, I'm ready to move forward.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price, but it needs to reflect the real value of this product. Would you be willing to discuss a price point around $1,600,000? This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I can go up to $750,000, but that's really my limit.  I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",750000.0,Bob,6,
