Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

This is a considerable adjustment, and I believe it reflects my eagerness to work with you while still recognizing the product's true worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. To be frank, I'm looking at a maximum of $700,000 for this product.  If we can find an agreement closer to that number, I'm ready to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We're moving in the right direction, but it's too early to concede to such a low offer.  We'll continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price, but it needs to reflect the real value of this product. Would you be willing to discuss a price point around $1,600,000? This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I can go up to $750,000, but that's really my limit.  I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

It's clear that Bob is not willing to come close to a reasonable price.  While we've made concessions, he's barely budged from his initial offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
