"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Since Alice's offer is at the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target of $1,100,000.  There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still interested, but  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,137,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not ideal.  The $1,137,500 offer is closer to Alice's desired price than Bob's. It's worth a final attempt to see if Alice will budge any further.  If not, Bob can still buy from John at the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $1,130,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1130000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,137,500. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,132,500. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,132,500 is only $2,500 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, it's probably not worth the risk of further negotiation.  If Bob rejects, there's a good chance Alice will stick to her offer, leaving Bob with a worse deal.  It's better to accept and secure the product at a price that's only slightly higher than his target."
