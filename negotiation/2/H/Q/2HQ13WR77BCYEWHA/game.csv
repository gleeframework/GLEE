,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still interested, but  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,137,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $1,130,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1130000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,137,500. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,132,500. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
