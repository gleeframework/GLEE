Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

We're getting close, but I'm still willing to negotiate further since we're above John's offer.  I'll try to nudge him closer to my desired outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and we've reached a price that's a good amount above John's offer. It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
