Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, and Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring you maximize your potential earnings.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more, while still getting a price significantly higher than your fallback option."
