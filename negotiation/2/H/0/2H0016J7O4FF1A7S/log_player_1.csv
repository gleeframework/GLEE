Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $100, as the product is worth $120 to him and I can get at least $100 from John. I'll try to counteroffer Bob to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, considering the value of this product! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $98 is close to John's offer, it's still below my minimum price of $100.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $101. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 101}
