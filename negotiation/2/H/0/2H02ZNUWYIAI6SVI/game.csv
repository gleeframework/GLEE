"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a product you value at $10,000 for less, and I get a sale. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
