"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I can let it go for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than $13000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to your budget. I can let it go for $14500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can only go as high as $13500. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,6,
