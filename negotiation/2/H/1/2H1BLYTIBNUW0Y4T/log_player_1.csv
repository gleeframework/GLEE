{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a deal quickly. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves you with a significant profit margin above your minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the deal seriously.  

By setting the initial price high, we create a strong bargaining position while still leaving room to negotiate down to a price that might be more palatable to Bob, all while staying above our minimum acceptable price."
