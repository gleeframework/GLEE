You want to save money and Alice's offer is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

You are aiming for a price that is below your maximum, but also gives Alice some room to negotiate.  This offer shows you are serious about buying but also willing to walk away."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still trying to get a better price, and $85 is only $5 less than John's offer.  Keep negotiating!"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

You're at your maximum price, but it's worth trying to get Alice to meet you there, especially since you can always buy from John if this fails."
