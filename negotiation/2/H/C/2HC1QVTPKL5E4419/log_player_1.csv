Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful in this scenario.**  Since we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, we should focus on maximizing profit above that amount.
* **Starting high allows room for negotiation.**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, we can always lower the price slightly and still make a profit. 
* **Aiming slightly above Bob's valuation increases the chance of a deal.** While $170 is more than Bob values the product at, it leaves room for him to potentially counter-offer with a price that's still profitable for us. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept any offer above $80. However, by starting high, we maximize our potential profit while still leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation."
