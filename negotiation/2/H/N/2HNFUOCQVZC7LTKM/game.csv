"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for something closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're willing to make a serious commitment to this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000 just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $10,000, which is still a good deal considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
