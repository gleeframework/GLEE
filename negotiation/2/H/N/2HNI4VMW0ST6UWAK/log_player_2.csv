"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that signals my intent to negotiate aggressively. I'm aiming to get a deal close to my maximum budget, but still leave room for potential concessions later in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I still have 7 rounds left, so there's time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to her, and we can move closer to a final agreement.  I also still have 6 rounds left, giving us time to negotiate further."
