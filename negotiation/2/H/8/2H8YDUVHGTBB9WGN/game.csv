"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget concerns, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,250. This would allow both of us to find some middle ground. Let me know if this works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $9,000. It's getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,125?  I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the previous offer. I'll give you $9,000, but I need you to come down to $9,000. Can we meet at this price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking with $9,000. I'm willing to come down to $9,100, but that's my final offer.  This is a good price for both of us. If you can't meet me at this price, I might have to explore other options.  Let me know what you think.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $9,100. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I need you to come down to $8,900. That's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",8900.0,Bob,8,
