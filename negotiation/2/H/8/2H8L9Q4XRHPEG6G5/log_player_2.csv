"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  $1,500,000 (John's price) - $900,000 (Alice's price) = $600,000 in savings.
* **It's still within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is well below that."
