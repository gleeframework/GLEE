Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to part with it for $135. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $135 represents a 12.5% markup, which is a reasonable starting point in a negotiation. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the product first, I'm creating a sense of exclusivity and urgency that might encourage him to accept the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, I can always negotiate down, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $120."
