Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more realistic. What do you say?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $8,000? I think that's a fair compromise.
