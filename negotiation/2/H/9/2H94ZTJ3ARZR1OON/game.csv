"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more realistic. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $8,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,4,
