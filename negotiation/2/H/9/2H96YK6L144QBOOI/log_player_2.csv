"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $110. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $110 is better than $120, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm a bit hesitant to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $108? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will be firm on $108, and he's better off accepting the deal rather than risking losing it and having to buy from John at a higher price."
