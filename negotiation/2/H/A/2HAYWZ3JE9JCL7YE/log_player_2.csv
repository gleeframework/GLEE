"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential for generating significant returns, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  There's still room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
