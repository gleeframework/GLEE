{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think it would be a great fit for you, and at this price it's a steal! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $119 makes it seem like a significant discount while still netting you a profit.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This offer aims to capitalize on the potential for Bob to value the product at a price slightly higher than his perceived value of $100, especially with the perception of a deal. If he declines, you still have your fallback option with John."
