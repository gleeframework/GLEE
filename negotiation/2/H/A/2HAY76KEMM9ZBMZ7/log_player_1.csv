"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my ideal value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum value and significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum value and is getting closer to what I'd like to get. While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I want to avoid the risk of going further and ending up with a lower price or losing the deal altogether.  It's time to close the deal."
