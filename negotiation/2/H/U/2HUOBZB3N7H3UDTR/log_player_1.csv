Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality and I'm keen to find it a good home. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, the goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting slightly below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's quality and doesn't make Bob feel pressured, potentially making him more receptive to the offer.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at the highest possible price while still ensuring you don't miss out on a sale entirely."
