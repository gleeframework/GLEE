"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high for Bob.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. After reconsidering, I'm willing to lower the price to $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer. While John offers a guaranteed purchase, it's still more expensive than Alice's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that $700,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit margin for you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $700000, which would be $725000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is now within Bob's target range. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away from the deal or counter with an even higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price, saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
