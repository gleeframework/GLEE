"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in this product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $650000 for it. This is a fair price considering the potential and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. After reconsidering, I'm willing to lower the price to $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that $700000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit margin for you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $700000, which would be $725000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,5,
