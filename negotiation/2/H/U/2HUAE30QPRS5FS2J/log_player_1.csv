Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, I'm willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price from him if I make a counteroffer.  Selling to John for $800,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."

We are getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob increases. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $800,000. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy with this outcome."
