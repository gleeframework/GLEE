Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer represents a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also indicates that you are serious about selling to Bob, but are not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm increasing Bob's offer by $100,000, which is a fair compromise considering his initial rejection. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also maintains a price point that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to increase Bob's offer by $25,000.  This is a small increase, but it demonstrates my flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. It's becoming clear that we're not likely to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John, even though it's not my ideal outcome."
