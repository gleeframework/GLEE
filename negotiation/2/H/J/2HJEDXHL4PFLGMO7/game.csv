"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Based on my understanding of its value, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000,  which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This represents the maximum I can afford to pay while still making this deal worthwhile for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Your offer is close, but we're still not quite there yet. I can come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
