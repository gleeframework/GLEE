Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale.  By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you create a space for negotiation without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is enticing, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees you a much better profit.  However, since Bob is interested and willing to negotiate further, rejecting his offer allows you to potentially reach a compromise that's closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value you've expressed for the product while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** By dropping to $1,300,000, you show flexibility and a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Still above your minimum:** This price is still higher than Bob's initial offer, giving you some negotiating leverage. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product reinforces the reason for a higher price.

This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I still think that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Even though there's a chance you could get a better offer from Bob, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for your desired price, securing your profit and minimizing the risk of further negotiations."
