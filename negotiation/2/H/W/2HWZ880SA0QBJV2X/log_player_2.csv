"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is still a fair price for Alice as it is above her valuation of the product at $10,000. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation, aiming to secure a favorable price while remaining within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,200 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his preferred range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price again.  Since he can get the product from John for $12,000, Bob is not desperate to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $10,800. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise, but he's also not willing to go much higher. This offer is still within his budget and is closer to Alice's preferred price. It's a calculated move to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging on her price, and her latest offer is $11,400, which is still above Bob's ideal price point.  Considering that Bob can buy the same product from John for $12,000, it's wiser for him to buy from John.  There's little chance Alice will drop her price to a level that would make it worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating with her."
