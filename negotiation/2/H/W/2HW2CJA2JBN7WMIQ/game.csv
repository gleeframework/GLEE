"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. Given the market value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of $912,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's worth it considering the product's value. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $912,500 is a stretch for my budget.  Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $887,500. This is a solid compromise that shows my commitment to this deal.  What do you think?",887500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.
