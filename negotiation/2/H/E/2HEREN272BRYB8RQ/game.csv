"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $700,000? That's a significant move on my part.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a significant move, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,5,
