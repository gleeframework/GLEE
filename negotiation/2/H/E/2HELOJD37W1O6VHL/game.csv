"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you place on the product and my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a reasonable price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go up to $10,500. I think that's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the maximum price you're willing to pay. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
