"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe there's potential to get a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his commitment and potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I want to show flexibility but also demonstrate that I'm not willing to sell for Bob's initial offer.  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and keep negotiating.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a slightly better deal.  I'm confident that I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm offering $1,650,000. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but also indicating that I'm not going to settle for much less than my desired price.  I believe this counteroffer might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only a small increase over John's offer, I'm running out of time and negotiating rounds. It's better to secure a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm happy with this outcome, considering my minimum acceptable price."
