Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'm not willing to sell it for $90. However, I don't want to completely shut down the negotiation either.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $90, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my initial price of $120.

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more. Let's see what he has to say!"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $105. I think I can get a better deal if I counteroffer again.

Since Bob's offer is already quite close to my target price, I'll make a smaller counteroffer to try to get the last bit of value out of the negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer of $115, which is just $5 more than Bob's latest offer. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle!"

I'll make one more counteroffer to try to get the last bit of value out of the negotiation. Since Bob's offer is already quite close to my target price, I'll make a relatively small counteroffer to try to get the last $3.
