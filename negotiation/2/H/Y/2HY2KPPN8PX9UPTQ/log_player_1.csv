Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

This offer is a starting point that gives Bob a good deal while also ensuring I make a significant profit. I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without sacrificing my own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is a good price, I'm still aiming to get closer to $140. It's worth risking a counteroffer from Bob to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $135. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is only $2 less than my previous counteroffer. It's getting close to my minimum desired profit and  continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $132."
