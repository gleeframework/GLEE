"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it will greatly benefit you. Considering its value, I propose a price of $950,000 for this incredible opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount of money. You want to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room to negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so you can aim for a price closer to that.
* **John's offer is a backup.**  You have the option to go to John if the negotiation fails, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, considering the product's value to you. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the mutual benefits and the value of the product, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both the value of the product to me and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While $900,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above what you believe the product is worth to you.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You know that Alice is willing to sell for less than $900,000, so there's potential to get a better price.
* **John's offer is still your backup plan.** You can always go to John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
