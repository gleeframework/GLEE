"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $925,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous counteroffer. I'm sticking with $950,000. If you're still interested, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
