"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $13,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's value to you, while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. Please let me know if this revised price works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
