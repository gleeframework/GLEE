"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below the value this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This takes into account the product's true worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $880,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $840,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",840000.0,Bob,4,
