"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $145. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $145 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $160? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $160 is a bit higher than my initial target, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $152.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider that?",152.5,Bob,4,
