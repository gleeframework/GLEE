Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, an overly inflated price might discourage Bob completely. This offer is closer to his perceived value while still giving us room to come down.
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to initiate a conversation, not just present a demand.  We want Bob to feel engaged and see this as a potential win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value ($1,000,000) than to our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John guarantees our minimum, but we might be able to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,050,000 is a fair offer, I was hoping to settle closer to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true potential and unique benefits this product offers. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims for a compromise. We've come down from our initial price, signaling flexibility, while still pushing for a price closer to our desired outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By asking if Bob is ""willing to meet somewhere in the middle,"" we keep the negotiation open and encourage him to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob and losing the sale. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the potential of having to settle for John's offer."
