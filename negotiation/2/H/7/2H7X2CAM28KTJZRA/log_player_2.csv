"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,050,000 is a fair offer, I was hoping to settle closer to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true potential and unique benefits this product offers. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
