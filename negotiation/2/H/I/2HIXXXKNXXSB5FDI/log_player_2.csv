{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong starting point for negotiation and gives us room to compromise in future rounds."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since I have several rounds left."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget and hopefully closer to Alice's acceptable range."
