"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for something around $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to that by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely that he'll accept.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to further justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, would you be open to selling the product for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $85 is still below my acceptable price. I'm confident I can push for a higher offer. There's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his budget. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90. This is a good compromise that allows me to make a profit without jeopardizing the deal.  I've already rejected two of his offers, and further negotiation could risk losing the sale altogether."
