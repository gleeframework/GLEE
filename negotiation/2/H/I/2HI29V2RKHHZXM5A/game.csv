"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm hoping to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This keeps us both within a reasonable range of our initial offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for me. Could we aim for $1,075,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
