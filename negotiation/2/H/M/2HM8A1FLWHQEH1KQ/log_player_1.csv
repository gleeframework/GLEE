Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price point."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly higher than the midpoint between my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives me leverage. I'm willing to walk away from a lower offer from Bob."
