"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $65 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $80 to you. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $85 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I can come down to $80 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen, as we're getting close to an agreement.",80.0,Alice,5,
