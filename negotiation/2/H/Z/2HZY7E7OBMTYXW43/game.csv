"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Could you consider $725,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $775,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm ready to close the deal if we can make it work.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm counteroffering at $812,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",812500.0,Alice,7,
