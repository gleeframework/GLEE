"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $9,500. It's a rare and highly sought-after item, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still above your ideal price.** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** Since you have a fallback option with John, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the initial offer opens the door for further negotiation."
