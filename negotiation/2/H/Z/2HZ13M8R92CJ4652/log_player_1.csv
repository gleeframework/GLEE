Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $1,350,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:

I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and ultimately prove to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $1,325,000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,400,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,325,000 is still a significant profit over John's offer."
