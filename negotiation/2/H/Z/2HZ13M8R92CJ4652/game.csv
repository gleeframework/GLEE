"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $1,350,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,400,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and ultimately prove to be a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $1,325,000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
