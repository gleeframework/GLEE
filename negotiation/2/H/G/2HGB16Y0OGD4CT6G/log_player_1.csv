"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This allows me to maximize potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to risk losing a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit. I believe this price is a good compromise and might be appealing to Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000."
