Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price.  This puts you in a strong position.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with your $1,000,000 asking price sets a high anchor. While it's higher than Bob's valuation, it establishes the product's perceived value.
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk to maximize your potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your desired price."
