"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This price still reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise given the value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to accept $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,125,000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
