"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. This price still reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise given the value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to accept $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,125,000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than my maximum price of $1,000,000. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems unlikely she'll come down to my desired price. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid further negotiation."
