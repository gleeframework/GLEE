Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can bring to the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price point that might be acceptable.  It's worth one more counter."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push Bob a little further, the gains are getting smaller.  $1,725,000 is a significant profit over John's offer, and the longer negotiations continue, the higher the risk of Bob walking away.  It's best to accept a good offer now rather than risk getting locked into a lower price later."
