"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement today. I am willing to offer the product to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Even though Alice has come down in price, we're still aiming to get as close to $8,000 as possible. It's worth seeing if she'll negotiate further before accepting or going with John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose we settle on $9,250 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while remaining competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $9,250.  It's a reasonable compromise, saving $750 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and there's a risk Alice might harden her stance."
