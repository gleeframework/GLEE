"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
