"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $10,250? This would still provide a good value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,250. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. This is a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a serious decision if we can meet at this price. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,
