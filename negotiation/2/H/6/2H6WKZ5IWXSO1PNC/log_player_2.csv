"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! After considering your interest, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than the product's worth to you ($1,200,000 vs. $1,000,000), you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $1,000,000. Buying from John saves you $200,000 and achieves your goal of getting the product for the best possible price."
