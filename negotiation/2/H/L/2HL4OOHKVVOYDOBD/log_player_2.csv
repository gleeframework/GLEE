# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $750,000 for the product. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant price reduction, knowing that Alice is motivated to sell. A $100,000 drop from her initial offer is a substantial starting point for negotiations.  This counteroffer signals my seriousness while leaving room for further bargaining."

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
