I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. I believe this gives me room to negotiate while still making a decent profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired value."

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal from John, so I'll sell to him."
