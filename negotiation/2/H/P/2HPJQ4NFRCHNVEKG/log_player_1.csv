Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:** You're getting more than $8,000, which is your minimum.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** He still gets the product for less than its value to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep Bob interested enough to continue the negotiation."
