"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. He is willing to spend up to $15,000, and this offer saves him $4,000.  While he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
