"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to me helps Bob understand the potential savings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without immediately making me feel like I need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counter and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strategic Risk Assessment:** Selling to John guarantees a higher price but eliminates the potential for a better deal with Bob.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm starting my counteroffer with a price closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to emphasize that $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Compromise:**  Offering to ""meet in the middle"" creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching My Minimum:** Bob's offer is now just $4,500 below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is Money:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to consider the potential for reaching a better deal with Bob.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm willing to take a slight risk to potentially close a deal with Bob. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a chance I could convince Bob to pay a bit more in future rounds if he's happy with the product."
