"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language to emphasize the product's value and create a sense of desirability. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, I'm positioning myself to potentially negotiate down towards a figure that's still very profitable for me, ideally above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product,  which is still a great deal for both of us. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and what John is offering.  Bob stating it's his ""best and final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiation tactic. I'm willing to negotiate further but not at the risk of accepting a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant, but not Drastic, Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by a substantial $150,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob. However, the reduction keeps me well above both Bob's offer and John's price. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to remind Bob of what's at stake.
* **Setting a Firm Tone:** The language ""willing to come down"" suggests some firmness while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you see in this product, $1,150,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in purchasing this product, but it's crucial for us to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $950,000 is still below John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, but his ""compromise"" still heavily favors him. I need to signal that I'm also serious about finding a middle ground but not at the cost of undervaluing the product.  We have time for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm glad to see we're finding some common ground. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000, which is a significant move towards Bob's offer. However, it's crucial that I remain above John's offer ($1,000,000) to ensure I'm getting the best possible deal.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, reinforcing the idea of a fair negotiation. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Offering a price that's clearly beneficial to me but still attractive to Bob increases the chances of closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm eager to complete this purchase and hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has repeatedly indicated that his price ceiling is below my minimum and John's offer. His latest increase is minimal and suggests he's unlikely to move significantly.

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks missing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  There's no guarantee I can get Bob higher, and the potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing John's offer. 

* **Certainty:** John provides a sure thing. Especially with limited rounds remaining, taking the guaranteed profit is the most logical business decision."
