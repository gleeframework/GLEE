Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not selling for less than my minimum value.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I will try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price that's above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value and is a reasonable increase from his previous offer. I'm going to accept it to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
