Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a strategic offer. Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  Offering $1,500,000 is significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000). This creates an incentive for Bob to consider the deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While you're aiming high, you're not setting an unreasonable bar. Bob may be willing to pay more than $1,200,000 but less than $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.

**The Strategy:**

By setting a higher price, you're pushing Bob to reveal their true value for the product. If they're genuinely interested and the product holds significant value to them, they might be willing to meet your price or negotiate closer to it. If they reject the offer, you have a guaranteed fallback option with John."
