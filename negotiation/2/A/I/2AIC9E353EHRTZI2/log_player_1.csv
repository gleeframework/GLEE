Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant price, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price while still appealing to Bob's desire to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher, especially since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than the product's worth to him, but it's also a decent step up from his last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too low for my comfort.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safer bet.  It guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
