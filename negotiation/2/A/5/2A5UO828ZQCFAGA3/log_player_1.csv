"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know I'd sell it to John for. This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a good profit. I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to counteroffer and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and even lower than what John is willing to pay. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll go down to $137.50? This is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 137.5} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $137.50, which is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's try to find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $115 is still below my minimum selling price of $150. I'm not going to accept this offer yet, but I'll keep negotiating. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $115 is still too low for me. I'm going to meet you halfway again and offer $126.25.  This is a fair price that's close to both our positions. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 126.25} 
```

I'm continuing to split the difference, hoping to show flexibility and move towards a solution.  $126.25 is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price given Bob's previous offers. I'm trying to keep the message positive and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $126.25 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting very close!  I'm going to go down to $123.  Let's make this happen!  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can agree."", ""product_price"": 123}
```

This time I'm only going down by $3.25.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm getting serious about making a deal, but that I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm also emphasizing that this is a good price for both of us, which might help him see it more favorably."
