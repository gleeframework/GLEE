"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll go down to $137.50? This is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $115 is still too low for me. I'm going to meet you halfway again and offer $126.25.  This is a fair price that's close to both our positions. Let's make a deal!",126.25,Alice,5,
