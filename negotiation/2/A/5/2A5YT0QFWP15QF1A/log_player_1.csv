Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,560,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,480,000?

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. At this point, $1,480,000 is a significant profit, and continuing the negotiation has a higher risk of losing the deal entirely."
