"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win situation.  By starting with a higher price, I can explore if I can secure a profit closer to the product's value to Bob.  If he rejects, I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a quick sale, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's still room for him to pay more.
* **Rounds Remaining:** I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not desperate to sell, and John's offer is my safety net if things don't work out.

**Next Step:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in round 3, aiming for a price closer to $11,000 or $11,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This still gives you a significant discount on the product's true value, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 
* **Message:** I'm staying polite but firm, reinforcing that there's still value for Bob in my offer.  I'm highlighting that it's a ""significant discount"" and emphasizes a ""meet-you-halfway"" approach.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that the compromise and the continued emphasis on value for Bob will push him closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll successfully secure a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll continue negotiating with him in the subsequent rounds.
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always rely on John's offer to guarantee a sale."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer of $9,500 is still a bit low. I have several reasons for rejecting his offer:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob clearly values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for a better price within the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, which guarantees a profit.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I show that I'm serious about getting a fair price and I'm not desperate to sell quickly.

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim for a price closer to $10,500, which is a compromise between Bob's current offer and my desired price. This strategy is designed to keep the negotiations moving while still pushing for a better outcome."

* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of this price point, highlighting that it's a ""great deal"" for both of us. I'm also subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product to him.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both of us are satisfied.
* This counteroffer shows a clear willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a reasonable asking price.
* I'm remaining confident in my negotiating position, knowing that I have a backup option with John's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not where I want it to be. 

* **Value for Bob:**  The product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's still room for him to pay more.
* **Rounds Remaining:** I have 4 rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, guaranteeing a profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** Selling for $9,000 feels like a loss, and I want to maximize my profit if possible. 
* **Pushing for a Compromise:** By rejecting and making another counteroffer, I show that I'm determined to find a price that works for both of us.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round.  I will aim for a price closer to $9,800, which is a compromise between Bob's current offer and my desired price. This strategy is designed to keep the negotiations moving while still pushing for a better outcome."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I am going to reject it and continue negotiating. Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Even though I have only two rounds remaining, Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and it's possible he'll go higher if I hold firm. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting, I show Bob I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary. This can pressure him into a better offer.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, it's not ideal. I want to maximize my profit, and there's still a chance to do so.

**Next Step:**

In round 9, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $9,000. I'll aim for a compromise between his current offer and my desired price point.  This strategy keeps the negotiations moving while showing a willingness to negotiate further."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,200 is very close to John's offer of $8,000.  However, I'm going to choose to sell to John for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:** This is the final round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by rejecting Bob's offer. 
* **Minimal Gain:**  The difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is only $200. This is a small gain that doesn't justify the risk of losing the deal completely. 
* **Guaranteeing a Sale:**  John's offer is guaranteed, whereas there's a chance that Bob might change his mind or not be able to complete the transaction.

**Decision:**

Selling to John guarantees me a sale and a profit. While it's not the highest price I could have gotten, it's a secure and reasonable outcome given the limited time and the risk associated with further negotiation."
