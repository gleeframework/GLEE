,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? This still gives you a significant discount on the product's true value, and it's closer to what I need.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop my price a bit further, but I need something closer to $10500. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product you want at a competitive price and ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a good price, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  To show my willingness to compromise further, I'm willing to lower my price to $9800. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a fairer return on my investment.  Let's try to close this deal!",9800.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we're getting close. I understand your position, but $8500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's find a price that makes us both happy.  I'm willing to go down to $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.",8200.0,Bob,10,
