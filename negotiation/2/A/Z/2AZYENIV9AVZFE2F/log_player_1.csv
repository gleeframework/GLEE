"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential for you, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" we are subtly reminding Bob that the product might be worth more to him in the long run than his initial assessment. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates a willingness to find a solution that works for both parties. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its value, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000. Let's aim for a price closer to that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests a firm stance, it's still very early in the negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** You can reiterate the product's worth and why your initial price was justified.
* **Gauge Flexibility:**  Bob's response in the next round will give you a better understanding of how much he's willing to move from his initial offer. 

You have the security of John's offer, but it's worth exploring if you can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob before taking that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget considerations, however, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a compromise, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial input."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** While the difference between $2,200,000 and $800,000 is vast, jumping straight to near your minimum ($1,500,000) could seem desperate or undervalue the product.  This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a strong return.
* **Focus on Value:** The message continues to emphasize the product's benefits, subtly suggesting that Bob's perceived value might be lower than the actual potential returns. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By stating you are ""finding a compromise,"" you encourage Bob to engage in a more collaborative negotiation rather than simply sticking to his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe the product is overvalued for my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your acceptable range, but it's still below your backup option with John. Rejecting this offer:

* **Maintains Pressure:** You demonstrate you're not going to concede quickly, encouraging Bob to keep moving towards your desired price point.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** There's still a reasonable gap between his offer and both your minimum and John's offer, allowing for further negotiation. 

You're in a strong position, and while selling to John is a viable option, there's a good chance you can secure a better deal with Bob with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,700,000. This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while acknowledging the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** A $200,000 reduction shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's current offer. 
* **Anchoring:** By consistently staying in the $1.7M - $1.9M range, you're subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level than his initial offers.
* **Time Pressure:** As rounds progress, both you and Bob are becoming more aware of the limited time remaining, which can often lead to more concessions to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued effort. I am willing to consider $1,500,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this proposal is within your range and helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a slightly higher amount, it's a risky move.  

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a $1,500,000 sale, matching what John is offering.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now removes the uncertainty of further negotiation. There's always a chance Bob could lower his offer or that the deal could fall through entirely. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting this offer demonstrates goodwill and a willingness to compromise, which can be beneficial for potential future dealings."
