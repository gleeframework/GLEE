"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $11000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10800, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11200. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $10500, and I'm getting close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $10500 one last time, but that's it. If you're not willing to sell at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",10500.0,Bob,10,
