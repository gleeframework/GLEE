"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for a loss.
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  This gives me room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price. 
* **While John is a safe option at $10,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price.**  I'll try to counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  I'm still not willing to sell at a loss.
* **I have 6 rounds left.**  This gives me some room to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my target price. 
* **While selling to John is always a safe option, I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob.**  I'll counter Bob's offer again, trying to find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.**  I have only 4 rounds left. 
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000.
* **Selling to John is a safe and reliable option.**  I'm getting my minimum asking price, and I'm not risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer.

I've tried to get a better deal with Bob, but we're still too far apart in our valuations.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John."
