"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm asking $1500000 for it, which is a fair price considering its unique capabilities and potential.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to accept immediately.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. Considering the potential of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. However, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting again allows you to try and push for a lower price closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000."
