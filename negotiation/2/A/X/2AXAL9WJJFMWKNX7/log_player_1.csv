Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 10500}

While I'm tempted to take the $9,750, I'm still confident I can get a slightly better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $9,500. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob.  He's stubbornly sticking to his $9,500 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000."
