"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately triggering a potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $1050000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have several rounds to work with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Avoiding the ""safe"" option:** Selling to John now would guarantee $1,000,000, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,050,000 is a bit low, given the product's significant value to you. How about $1,100,000? This allows for some wiggle room on both sides, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a new price to keep negotiations alive.
* **Middle ground:**  $1,100,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing a quick close to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1075000. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** We have several rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Selling to John at this point would guarantee a profit, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,075,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's full value to you.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my offer.
* **Appeal to his needs:**  I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob to justify the price.
* **Close the deal:**  I'm emphasizing a desire to finalize the deal to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1080000. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **We are close:** We are only $20,000 apart, and I believe I can push for a bit more. 
* **More rounds to negotiate:** We have several rounds left. It's risky to sell to John at this point as we are so close to a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,085,000. This is a very small difference, and we can close this deal right now.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a very small concession, demonstrating a willingness to be flexible. 
* **Emphasis on closing:**  I'm highlighting the opportunity to quickly close the deal and avoid further negotiation.
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer. I would like to propose a price of $1077500. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,077,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to the last three rounds, and there is a high risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Small difference:**  While the difference between Bob's offer and my desired price is now only $2,500, it's still a significant amount of money.
* **Guarantee the minimum:** Selling to John now will guarantee me my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss of this guaranteed profit."
