"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $1050000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1050000 is a bit low, given the product's significant value to you. How about $1100000? This allows for some wiggle room on both sides, and we can close this deal quickly.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1075000. This is my final offer within my budget constraints.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1075000 simply doesn't reflect the product's full value to you.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $1090000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1085000. This is a very small difference, and we can close this deal right now.  What do you say?",1085000.0,Alice,7,
