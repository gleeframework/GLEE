"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $140, which is still within your budget. 
* However, you want to save as much money as possible.
* You can get the product from John for $150, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John gives you a better deal."
