Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,800,000 is a high price, it's not unrealistic if the product is truly valuable to Bob. This leaves room for Bob to counter without immediately feeling like it's a deal-breaker. 
* **Strategic Approach:**  This offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This opens the door for a counteroffer where I can try to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be a safe option, but it would also leave money on the table if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,800,000 to $1,400,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows a good-faith attempt to meet halfway. 
* **Strategic Position:**  $1,400,000 is still above my minimum value, allowing me to profit from the sale while potentially encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to meet this price.  However, it's significantly higher than his offer, showing him I'm not desperate to sell for his current price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, it's still below it.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price, potentially even below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the potential for a lower price with Bob and the guaranteed profit with John, it's more prudent to sell to John at this point."
