Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,400,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counter offer. While your valuation is understandable, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This still leaves a considerable margin for you to realize a significant return on this investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its actual value and potential return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While a higher price would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his $1,200,000 offer secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
