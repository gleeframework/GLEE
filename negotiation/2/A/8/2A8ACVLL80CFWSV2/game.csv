"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,400,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at that price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making a counter offer. While your valuation is understandable, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This still leaves a considerable margin for you to realize a significant return on this investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its actual value and potential return on investment.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
