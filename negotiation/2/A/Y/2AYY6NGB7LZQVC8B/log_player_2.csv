"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000). This means there's room for negotiation and a potentially better price.
* **Avoiding the ""Good Enough"" Trap:** Accepting Alice's offer might feel good in the moment, but Bob could regret not trying to get a lower price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having the option to buy from John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can still secure the product. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can start negotiating and potentially save a significant amount of money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll see the value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob should still reject it.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation Is Still Possible:** Alice is willing to compromise, which means there's more room for negotiation.  Bob can still try to get a lower price.
* **Closer to John's Price:** The price is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000.  It's important to keep John as a viable alternative to incentivize Alice to negotiate further.
* **Risk/Reward:**  While accepting now saves some money, there's a chance Bob could get a better deal with another counteroffer.  The risk of missing out on a lower price is higher than the risk of a failed negotiation. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going and potentially saves even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  $1,250,000 is a significant discount compared to John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **Alice's Final Offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and further negotiation might be futile.
* **Potential for Further Delays:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and increase the risk of missing out on the product altogether.  

While there might be a slim chance of getting an even lower price, the risk of losing the product or incurring further negotiation delays outweighs the potential benefit. Accepting the offer at $1,250,000 secures a valuable product at a good price and avoids further complications."
