Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. A price of $950,000 ensures a significant profit above Bob's valuation.
* **Time Value of Money:** Waiting for John means potentially delaying the sale. A slightly lower price to Bob accelerates the transaction and mitigates risks associated with waiting.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also positions the product as highly valuable."
