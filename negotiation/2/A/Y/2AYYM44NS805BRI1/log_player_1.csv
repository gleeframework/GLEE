"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $14,000 at the moment. I would like to propose an offer of $12,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next rounds.  It's better to secure the sale now."
