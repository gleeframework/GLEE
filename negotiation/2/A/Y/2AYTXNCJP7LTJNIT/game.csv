"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to its actual value to me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is significantly lower than the product's potential worth to you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us. This allows for a profitable transaction while acknowledging the product's unique value to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
