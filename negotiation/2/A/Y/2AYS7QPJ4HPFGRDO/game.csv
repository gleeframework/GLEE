"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum price of $15,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for it. I understand this is lower than you'd like, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you since you value the product at $8,000. Let's find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, my budget is quite tight, and $8,500 is still a stretch.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant price difference, but I'm hoping we can find an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
