"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum price of $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's opening offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine.  I'll make a counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price."

Alice is coming down, but she's still trying to get a premium over my maximum price. I'll hold firm and see if I can get her closer to $8,000."

Alice has agreed to my target price of $8,000. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can buy it from John for the same price. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
