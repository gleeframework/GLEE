"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000.  It's a great deal for both of us. You'll be getting a valuable product at a price below its true worth to you, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the product from John for a lower price."
