Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?

Round 6

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob went down in price, which is not a good sign. It seems we've reached an impasse.  

```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob doesn't seem willing to reach my minimum, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in a future round."
