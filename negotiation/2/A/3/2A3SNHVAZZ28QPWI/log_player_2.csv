"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great compromise, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but $100 is still a significant markup from her $80 value. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your $90 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $95? That seems like a fair deal to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $95 just yet. I can offer you a slight adjustment to $98. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and at $98, the price is getting close to your limit.  While you might be able to squeeze out another dollar or two, it's not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. Accepting at $98 secures you a reasonable discount."
