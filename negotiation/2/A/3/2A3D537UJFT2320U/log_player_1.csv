Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Accounting for Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $120, offering it at $150 gives him a starting point to potentially negotiate down, while still staying significantly above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's less pressure to settle for a low price from Bob."
