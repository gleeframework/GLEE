"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. It's a bit out of my budget, but I really need this product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's try to find a compromise.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can do $88 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you need without breaking the bank.  Let's close this deal.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. I'm really interested in getting this deal done, but I need to stay within my budget.",82.0,Bob,6,
